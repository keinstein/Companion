    <p>Our administration has said that minutes and letters are to be
	    archived in XML. Can the TEI help us? We will consider how
	  to build very specialized customizations of the TEI,
	    and customize editing tools for easy authoring. We will
	    also look at what markup to put in office documents so
	    that they can be indexed in useful ways.</p>
