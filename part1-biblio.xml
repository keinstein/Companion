<p>We treat bibliographical tools as a special case of the highly structured
textual datasets which XML was designed for: moreover, everyone needs
bibliographical tools. We discuss how to create bibliographic records which are
re-usable by different word processing and publishing systems, both starting from
scratch and  by conversion from other proprietary systems. We also discuss briefly
how to store and such records in TEI format, and how to format such records in
differing styles.  </p>
