      <div><head>ACT I</head>

<div><head>SCENE I.  Troy. Before Priam's palace.</head>
<stage>Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:</ab>
<ab>Why should I war without the walls of Troy,</ab>
<ab>That find such cruel battle here within?</ab>
<ab>Each Trojan that is master of his heart,</ab>
<ab>Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Will this gear ne'er be mended?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,</ab>
<ab>Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;</ab>
<ab>But I am weaker than a woman's tear,</ab>
<ab>Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,</ab>
<ab>Less valiant than the virgin in the night</ab>
<ab>And skilless as unpractised infancy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,</ab>
<ab>I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will</ab>
<ab>have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Have I not tarried?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry</ab>
<ab>the bolting.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Have I not tarried?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Still have I tarried.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word</ab>
<ab>'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the</ab>
<ab>heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must</ab>
<ab>stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,</ab>
<ab>Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.</ab>
<ab>At Priam's royal table do I sit;</ab>
<ab>And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--</ab>
<ab>So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw</ab>
<ab>her look, or any woman else.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,</ab>
<ab>As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,</ab>
<ab>Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,</ab>
<ab>I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,</ab>
<ab>Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:</ab>
<ab>But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,</ab>
<ab>Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--</ab>
<ab>well, go to--there were no more comparison between</ab>
<ab>the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I</ab>
<ab>would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would</ab>
<ab>somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I</ab>
<ab>will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--</ab>
<ab>When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,</ab>
<ab>Reply not in how many fathoms deep</ab>
<ab>They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad</ab>
<ab>In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'</ab>
<ab>Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart</ab>
<ab>Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,</ab>
<ab>Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,</ab>
<ab>In whose comparison all whites are ink,</ab>
<ab>Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure</ab>
<ab>The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense</ab>
<ab>Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,</ab>
<ab>As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;</ab>
<ab>But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,</ab>
<ab>Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me</ab>
<ab>The knife that made it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I speak no more than truth.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Thou dost not speak so much.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:</ab>
<ab>if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be</ab>
<ab>not, she has the mends in her own hands.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of</ab>
<ab>her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and</ab>
<ab>between, but small thanks for my labour.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair</ab>
<ab>as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as</ab>
<ab>fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care</ab>
<ab>I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Say I she is not fair?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to</ab>
<ab>stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so</ab>
<ab>I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,</ab>
<ab>I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Pandarus,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Not I.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Sweet Pandarus,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I</ab>
<ab>found it, and there an end.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit PANDARUS. An alarum</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!</ab>
<ab>Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,</ab>
<ab>When with your blood you daily paint her thus.</ab>
<ab>I cannot fight upon this argument;</ab>
<ab>It is too starved a subject for my sword.</ab>
<ab>But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!</ab>
<ab>I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;</ab>
<ab>And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.</ab>
<ab>As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.</ab>
<ab>Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,</ab>
<ab>What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?</ab>
<ab>Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:</ab>
<ab>Between our Ilium and where she resides,</ab>
<ab>Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,</ab>
<ab>Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar</ab>
<ab>Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Alarum. Enter AENEAS</stage>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,</ab>
<ab>For womanish it is to be from thence.</ab>
<ab>What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>That Paris is returned home and hurt.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>By whom, AEneas?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Troilus, by Menelaus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;</ab>
<ab>Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Alarum</stage>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'</ab>
<ab>But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>In all swift haste.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Come, go we then together.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE II.  The Same. A street.</head>
<stage>Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER</stage>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Who were those went by?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>Queen Hecuba and Helen.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>And whither go they?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>Up to the eastern tower,</ab>
<ab>Whose height commands as subject all the vale,</ab>
<ab>To see the battle. Hector, whose patience</ab>
<ab>Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:</ab>
<ab>He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,</ab>
<ab>And, like as there were husbandry in war,</ab>
<ab>Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,</ab>
<ab>And to the field goes he; where every flower</ab>
<ab>Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw</ab>
<ab>In Hector's wrath.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>What was his cause of anger?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks</ab>
<ab>A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;</ab>
<ab>They call him Ajax.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Good; and what of him?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>They say he is a very man per se,</ab>
<ab>And stands alone.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their</ab>
<ab>particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,</ab>
<ab>churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man</ab>
<ab>into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his</ab>
<ab>valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with</ab>
<ab>discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he</ab>
<ab>hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he</ab>
<ab>carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without</ab>
<ab>cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the</ab>
<ab>joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint</ab>
<ab>that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,</ab>
<ab>or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>But how should this man, that makes</ab>
<ab>me smile, make Hector angry?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and</ab>
<ab>struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath</ab>
<ab>ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Who comes here?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>Madam, your uncle Pandarus.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter PANDARUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Hector's a gallant man.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALEXANDER</speaker>

<ab>As may be in the world, lady.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>What's that? what's that?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?</ab>
<ab>Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When</ab>
<ab>were you at Ilium?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>This morning, uncle.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector</ab>
<ab>armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not</ab>
<ab>up, was she?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Even so: Hector was stirring early.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>That were we talking of, and of his anger.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Was he angry?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>So he says here.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay</ab>
<ab>about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's</ab>
<ab>Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take</ab>
<ab>heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>What, is he angry too?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>O Jupiter! there's no comparison.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a</ab>
<ab>man if you see him?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>So he is.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>He is not Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were</ab>
<ab>himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend</ab>
<ab>or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were</ab>
<ab>in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Excuse me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>He is elder.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Pardon me, pardon me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another</ab>
<ab>tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not</ab>
<ab>have his wit this year.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>He shall not need it, if he have his own.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Nor his qualities.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>No matter.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Nor his beauty.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>'Twould not become him; his own's better.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You have no judgment, niece: Helen</ab>
<ab>herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for</ab>
<ab>a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--</ab>
<ab>not brown neither,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>No, but brown.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>To say the truth, true and not true.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>She praised his complexion above Paris.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Why, Paris hath colour enough.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>So he has.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised</ab>
<ab>him above, his complexion is higher than his; he</ab>
<ab>having colour enough, and the other higher, is too</ab>
<ab>flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as</ab>
<ab>lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for</ab>
<ab>a copper nose.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Then she's a merry Greek indeed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other</ab>
<ab>day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he</ab>
<ab>has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his</ab>
<ab>particulars therein to a total.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within</ab>
<ab>three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came</ab>
<ab>and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling</ab>
<ab>becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>O, he smiles valiantly.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Does he not?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen</ab>
<ab>loves Troilus,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll</ab>
<ab>prove it so.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem</ab>
<ab>an addle egg.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle</ab>
<ab>head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled</ab>
<ab>his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I</ab>
<ab>must needs confess,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Without the rack.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed</ab>
<ab>that her eyes ran o'er.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>With mill-stones.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>And Cassandra laughed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>But there was more temperate fire under the pot of</ab>
<ab>her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>And Hector laughed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>At what was all this laughing?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed</ab>
<ab>too.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>What was his answer?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your</ab>
<ab>chin, and one of them is white.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>This is her question.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and</ab>
<ab>fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white</ab>
<ab>hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'</ab>
<ab>'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,</ab>
<ab>my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't</ab>
<ab>out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!</ab>
<ab>and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the</ab>
<ab>rest so laughed, that it passed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>So let it now; for it has been while going by.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>So I do.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere</ab>
<ab>a man born in April.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle</ab>
<ab>against May.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>A retreat sounded</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we</ab>
<ab>stand up here, and see them as they pass toward</ab>
<ab>Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>At your pleasure.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may</ab>
<ab>see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their</ab>
<ab>names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Speak not so loud.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>AENEAS passes</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of</ab>
<ab>the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark</ab>
<ab>Troilus; you shall see anon.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>ANTENOR passes</stage>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Who's that?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;</ab>
<ab>and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest</ab>
<ab>judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.</ab>
<ab>When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if</ab>
<ab>he see me, you shall see him nod at me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Will he give you the nod?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You shall see.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>If he do, the rich shall have more.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>HECTOR passes</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a</ab>
<ab>fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,</ab>
<ab>niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's</ab>
<ab>a countenance! is't not a brave man?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>O, a brave man!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you</ab>
<ab>what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do</ab>
<ab>you see? look you there: there's no jesting;</ab>
<ab>there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:</ab>
<ab>there be hacks!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Be those with swords?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come</ab>
<ab>to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's</ab>
<ab>heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.</ab>
<stage>PARIS passes</stage>
<ab>Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,</ab>
<ab>is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came</ab>
<ab>hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do</ab>
<ab>Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see</ab>
<ab>Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>HELENUS passes</stage>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Who's that?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's</ab>
<ab>Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Can Helenus fight, uncle?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I</ab>
<ab>marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the</ab>
<ab>people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>What sneaking fellow comes yonder?</ab>
</sp>

<stage>TROILUS passes</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!</ab>
<ab>there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the</ab>
<ab>prince of chivalry!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Peace, for shame, peace!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon</ab>
<ab>him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and</ab>
<ab>his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,</ab>
<ab>and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw</ab>
<ab>three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!</ab>
<ab>Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,</ab>
<ab>he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?</ab>
<ab>Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to</ab>
<ab>change, would give an eye to boot.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Here come more.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Forces pass</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!</ab>
<ab>porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the</ab>
<ab>eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles</ab>
<ab>are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had</ab>
<ab>rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and</ab>
<ab>all Greece.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Well, well.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have</ab>
<ab>you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not</ab>
<ab>birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,</ab>
<ab>learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,</ab>
<ab>and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date</ab>
<ab>in the pie, for then the man's date's out.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you</ab>
<ab>lie.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to</ab>
<ab>defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine</ab>
<ab>honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to</ab>
<ab>defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a</ab>
<ab>thousand watches.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Say one of your watches.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the</ab>
<ab>chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would</ab>
<ab>not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took</ab>
<ab>the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's</ab>
<ab>past watching.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You are such another!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter Troilus's Boy</stage>

<sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>

<ab>Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Where?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>

<ab>At your own house; there he unarms him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Good boy, tell him I come.</ab>
<stage>Exit boy</stage>
<ab>I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Adieu, uncle.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I'll be with you, niece, by and by.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>To bring, uncle?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, a token from Troilus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>By the same token, you are a bawd.</ab>
<stage>Exit PANDARUS</stage>
<ab>Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,</ab>
<ab>He offers in another's enterprise;</ab>
<ab>But more in Troilus thousand fold I see</ab>
<ab>Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;</ab>
<ab>Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:</ab>
<ab>Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.</ab>
<ab>That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:</ab>
<ab>Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:</ab>
<ab>That she was never yet that ever knew</ab>
<ab>Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.</ab>
<ab>Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:</ab>
<ab>Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:</ab>
<ab>Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,</ab>
<ab>Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE III.  The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.</head>
<stage>Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES,
MENELAUS, and others</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Princes,</ab>
<ab>What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?</ab>
<ab>The ample proposition that hope makes</ab>
<ab>In all designs begun on earth below</ab>
<ab>Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters</ab>
<ab>Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,</ab>
<ab>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</ab>
<ab>Infect the sound pine and divert his grain</ab>
<ab>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</ab>
<ab>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</ab>
<ab>That we come short of our suppose so far</ab>
<ab>That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;</ab>
<ab>Sith every action that hath gone before,</ab>
<ab>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</ab>
<ab>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,</ab>
<ab>And that unbodied figure of the thought</ab>
<ab>That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,</ab>
<ab>Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,</ab>
<ab>And call them shames? which are indeed nought else</ab>
<ab>But the protractive trials of great Jove</ab>
<ab>To find persistive constancy in men:</ab>
<ab>The fineness of which metal is not found</ab>
<ab>In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,</ab>
<ab>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,</ab>
<ab>The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:</ab>
<ab>But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,</ab>
<ab>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,</ab>
<ab>Puffing at all, winnows the light away;</ab>
<ab>And what hath mass or matter, by itself</ab>
<ab>Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>With due observance of thy godlike seat,</ab>
<ab>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply</ab>
<ab>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance</ab>
<ab>Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,</ab>
<ab>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</ab>
<ab>Upon her patient breast, making their way</ab>
<ab>With those of nobler bulk!</ab>
<ab>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</ab>
<ab>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</ab>
<ab>The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,</ab>
<ab>Bounding between the two moist elements,</ab>
<ab>Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat</ab>
<ab>Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now</ab>
<ab>Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,</ab>
<ab>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so</ab>
<ab>Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide</ab>
<ab>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness</ab>
<ab>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze</ab>
<ab>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind</ab>
<ab>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</ab>
<ab>And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage</ab>
<ab>As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,</ab>
<ab>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key</ab>
<ab>Retorts to chiding fortune.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Agamemnon,</ab>
<ab>Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,</ab>
<ab>Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.</ab>
<ab>In whom the tempers and the minds of all</ab>
<ab>Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.</ab>
<ab>Besides the applause and approbation To which,</ab>
<stage>To AGAMEMNON</stage>
<ab>most mighty for thy place and sway,</ab>
<stage>To NESTOR</stage>
<ab>And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life</ab>
<ab>I give to both your speeches, which were such</ab>
<ab>As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece</ab>
<ab>Should hold up high in brass, and such again</ab>
<ab>As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,</ab>
<ab>Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree</ab>
<ab>On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears</ab>
<ab>To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,</ab>
<ab>Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect</ab>
<ab>That matter needless, of importless burden,</ab>
<ab>Divide thy lips, than we are confident,</ab>
<ab>When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,</ab>
<ab>We shall hear music, wit and oracle.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</ab>
<ab>And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,</ab>
<ab>But for these instances.</ab>
<ab>The specialty of rule hath been neglected:</ab>
<ab>And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand</ab>
<ab>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</ab>
<ab>When that the general is not like the hive</ab>
<ab>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</ab>
<ab>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</ab>
<ab>The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</ab>
<ab>The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre</ab>
<ab>Observe degree, priority and place,</ab>
<ab>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</ab>
<ab>Office and custom, in all line of order;</ab>
<ab>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</ab>
<ab>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered</ab>
<ab>Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye</ab>
<ab>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</ab>
<ab>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</ab>
<ab>Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets</ab>
<ab>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</ab>
<ab>What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!</ab>
<ab>What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!</ab>
<ab>Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,</ab>
<ab>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</ab>
<ab>The unity and married calm of states</ab>
<ab>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,</ab>
<ab>Which is the ladder to all high designs,</ab>
<ab>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,</ab>
<ab>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</ab>
<ab>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</ab>
<ab>The primogenitive and due of birth,</ab>
<ab>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</ab>
<ab>But by degree, stand in authentic place?</ab>
<ab>Take but degree away, untune that string,</ab>
<ab>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</ab>
<ab>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</ab>
<ab>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</ab>
<ab>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</ab>
<ab>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</ab>
<ab>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</ab>
<ab>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</ab>
<ab>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</ab>
<ab>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</ab>
<ab>Then every thing includes itself in power,</ab>
<ab>Power into will, will into appetite;</ab>
<ab>And appetite, an universal wolf,</ab>
<ab>So doubly seconded with will and power,</ab>
<ab>Must make perforce an universal prey,</ab>
<ab>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</ab>
<ab>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</ab>
<ab>Follows the choking.</ab>
<ab>And this neglection of degree it is</ab>
<ab>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</ab>
<ab>It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd</ab>
<ab>By him one step below, he by the next,</ab>
<ab>That next by him beneath; so every step,</ab>
<ab>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</ab>
<ab>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</ab>
<ab>Of pale and bloodless emulation:</ab>
<ab>And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</ab>
<ab>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</ab>
<ab>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd</ab>
<ab>The fever whereof all our power is sick.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,</ab>
<ab>What is the remedy?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns</ab>
<ab>The sinew and the forehand of our host,</ab>
<ab>Having his ear full of his airy fame,</ab>
<ab>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</ab>
<ab>Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus</ab>
<ab>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</ab>
<ab>Breaks scurril jests;</ab>
<ab>And with ridiculous and awkward action,</ab>
<ab>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</ab>
<ab>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</ab>
<ab>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</ab>
<ab>And, like a strutting player, whose conceit</ab>
<ab>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</ab>
<ab>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</ab>
<ab>'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--</ab>
<ab>Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming</ab>
<ab>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,</ab>
<ab>'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,</ab>
<ab>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd</ab>
<ab>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</ab>
<ab>The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,</ab>
<ab>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;</ab>
<ab>Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.</ab>
<ab>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,</ab>
<ab>As he being drest to some oration.'</ab>
<ab>That's done, as near as the extremest ends</ab>
<ab>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:</ab>
<ab>Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!</ab>
<ab>'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</ab>
<ab>Arming to answer in a night alarm.'</ab>
<ab>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age</ab>
<ab>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</ab>
<ab>And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,</ab>
<ab>Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport</ab>
<ab>Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;</ab>
<ab>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</ab>
<ab>In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,</ab>
<ab>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</ab>
<ab>Severals and generals of grace exact,</ab>
<ab>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</ab>
<ab>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</ab>
<ab>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</ab>
<ab>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>And in the imitation of these twain--</ab>
<ab>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</ab>
<ab>With an imperial voice--many are infect.</ab>
<ab>Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head</ab>
<ab>In such a rein, in full as proud a place</ab>
<ab>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;</ab>
<ab>Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,</ab>
<ab>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</ab>
<ab>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</ab>
<ab>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</ab>
<ab>To weaken and discredit our exposure,</ab>
<ab>How rank soever rounded in with danger.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,</ab>
<ab>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</ab>
<ab>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</ab>
<ab>But that of hand: the still and mental parts,</ab>
<ab>That do contrive how many hands shall strike,</ab>
<ab>When fitness calls them on, and know by measure</ab>
<ab>Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--</ab>
<ab>Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:</ab>
<ab>They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;</ab>
<ab>So that the ram that batters down the wall,</ab>
<ab>For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,</ab>
<ab>They place before his hand that made the engine,</ab>
<ab>Or those that with the fineness of their souls</ab>
<ab>By reason guide his execution.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse</ab>
<ab>Makes many Thetis' sons.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>A tucket</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>What trumpet? look, Menelaus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<stage>Enter AENEAS</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>What would you 'fore our tent?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Even this.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>May one, that is a herald and a prince,</ab>
<ab>Do a fair message to his kingly ears?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>With surety stronger than Achilles' arm</ab>
<ab>'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice</ab>
<ab>Call Agamemnon head and general.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Fair leave and large security. How may</ab>
<ab>A stranger to those most imperial looks</ab>
<ab>Know them from eyes of other mortals?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>How!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Ay;</ab>
<ab>I ask, that I might waken reverence,</ab>
<ab>And bid the cheek be ready with a blush</ab>
<ab>Modest as morning when she coldly eyes</ab>
<ab>The youthful Phoebus:</ab>
<ab>Which is that god in office, guiding men?</ab>
<ab>Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy</ab>
<ab>Are ceremonious courtiers.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,</ab>
<ab>As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:</ab>
<ab>But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,</ab>
<ab>Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,</ab>
<ab>Jove's accord,</ab>
<ab>Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,</ab>
<ab>Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!</ab>
<ab>The worthiness of praise distains his worth,</ab>
<ab>If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:</ab>
<ab>But what the repining enemy commends,</ab>
<ab>That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,</ab>
<ab>transcends.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, Greek, that is my name.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>What's your affair I pray you?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:</ab>
<ab>I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,</ab>
<ab>To set his sense on the attentive bent,</ab>
<ab>And then to speak.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Speak frankly as the wind;</ab>
<ab>It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:</ab>
<ab>That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,</ab>
<ab>He tells thee so himself.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Trumpet, blow loud,</ab>
<ab>Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;</ab>
<ab>And every Greek of mettle, let him know,</ab>
<ab>What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.</ab>
<stage>Trumpet sounds</stage>
<ab>We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy</ab>
<ab>A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--</ab>
<ab>Who in this dull and long-continued truce</ab>
<ab>Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,</ab>
<ab>And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!</ab>
<ab>If there be one among the fair'st of Greece</ab>
<ab>That holds his honour higher than his ease,</ab>
<ab>That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,</ab>
<ab>That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,</ab>
<ab>That loves his mistress more than in confession,</ab>
<ab>With truant vows to her own lips he loves,</ab>
<ab>And dare avow her beauty and her worth</ab>
<ab>In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.</ab>
<ab>Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,</ab>
<ab>Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,</ab>
<ab>He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,</ab>
<ab>Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,</ab>
<ab>And will to-morrow with his trumpet call</ab>
<ab>Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,</ab>
<ab>To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:</ab>
<ab>If any come, Hector shall honour him;</ab>
<ab>If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,</ab>
<ab>The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth</ab>
<ab>The splinter of a lance. Even so much.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;</ab>
<ab>If none of them have soul in such a kind,</ab>
<ab>We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;</ab>
<ab>And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,</ab>
<ab>That means not, hath not, or is not in love!</ab>
<ab>If then one is, or hath, or means to be,</ab>
<ab>That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man</ab>
<ab>When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;</ab>
<ab>But if there be not in our Grecian host</ab>
<ab>One noble man that hath one spark of fire,</ab>
<ab>To answer for his love, tell him from me</ab>
<ab>I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver</ab>
<ab>And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,</ab>
<ab>And meeting him will tell him that my lady</ab>
<ab>Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste</ab>
<ab>As may be in the world: his youth in flood,</ab>
<ab>I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Amen.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;</ab>
<ab>To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.</ab>
<ab>Achilles shall have word of this intent;</ab>
<ab>So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:</ab>
<ab>Yourself shall feast with us before you go</ab>
<ab>And find the welcome of a noble foe.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR</stage>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Nestor!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>What says Ulysses?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>I have a young conception in my brain;</ab>
<ab>Be you my time to bring it to some shape.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>What is't?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>This 'tis:</ab>
<ab>Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride</ab>
<ab>That hath to this maturity blown up</ab>
<ab>In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,</ab>
<ab>Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,</ab>
<ab>To overbulk us all.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Well, and how?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</ab>
<ab>However it is spread in general name,</ab>
<ab>Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,</ab>
<ab>Whose grossness little characters sum up:</ab>
<ab>And, in the publication, make no strain,</ab>
<ab>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</ab>
<ab>As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,</ab>
<ab>'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,</ab>
<ab>Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose</ab>
<ab>Pointing on him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>And wake him to the answer, think you?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,</ab>
<ab>That can from Hector bring his honour off,</ab>
<ab>If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,</ab>
<ab>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</ab>
<ab>For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute</ab>
<ab>With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,</ab>
<ab>Our imputation shall be oddly poised</ab>
<ab>In this wild action; for the success,</ab>
<ab>Although particular, shall give a scantling</ab>
<ab>Of good or bad unto the general;</ab>
<ab>And in such indexes, although small pricks</ab>
<ab>To their subsequent volumes, there is seen</ab>
<ab>The baby figure of the giant mass</ab>
<ab>Of things to come at large. It is supposed</ab>
<ab>He that meets Hector issues from our choice</ab>
<ab>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</ab>
<ab>Makes merit her election, and doth boil,</ab>
<ab>As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd</ab>
<ab>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,</ab>
<ab>What heart receives from hence the conquering part,</ab>
<ab>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</ab>
<ab>Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,</ab>
<ab>In no less working than are swords and bows</ab>
<ab>Directive by the limbs.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Give pardon to my speech:</ab>
<ab>Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.</ab>
<ab>Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,</ab>
<ab>And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,</ab>
<ab>The lustre of the better yet to show,</ab>
<ab>Shall show the better. Do not consent</ab>
<ab>That ever Hector and Achilles meet;</ab>
<ab>For both our honour and our shame in this</ab>
<ab>Are dogg'd with two strange followers.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</ab>
<ab>Were he not proud, we all should share with him:</ab>
<ab>But he already is too insolent;</ab>
<ab>And we were better parch in Afric sun</ab>
<ab>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</ab>
<ab>Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,</ab>
<ab>Why then, we did our main opinion crush</ab>
<ab>In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;</ab>
<ab>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw</ab>
<ab>The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves</ab>
<ab>Give him allowance for the better man;</ab>
<ab>For that will physic the great Myrmidon</ab>
<ab>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</ab>
<ab>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</ab>
<ab>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</ab>
<ab>We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,</ab>
<ab>Yet go we under our opinion still</ab>
<ab>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,</ab>
<ab>Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:</ab>
<ab>Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Ulysses,</ab>
<ab>Now I begin to relish thy advice;</ab>
<ab>And I will give a taste of it forthwith</ab>
<ab>To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.</ab>
<ab>Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone</ab>
<ab>Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.</ab>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Dog!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?</ab>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel</ab>
<ab>beef-witted lord!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will</ab>
<ab>beat thee into handsomeness.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,</ab>
<ab>I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than</ab>
<ab>thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,</ab>
<ab>canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>The proclamation!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had</ab>
<ab>the scratching of thee; I would make thee the</ab>
<ab>loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in</ab>
<ab>the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>I say, the proclamation!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,</ab>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no</ab>

<ab>here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and</ab>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,</ab>
<ab>Thersites! what's the matter, man?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>You see him there, do you?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Ay; what's the matter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Nay, look upon him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>So I do: what's the matter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Nay, but regard him well.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>'Well!' why, I do so.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you</ab>
<ab>take him to be, he is Ajax.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I know that, fool.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Ay, but that fool knows not himself.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Therefore I beat thee.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his</ab>
<ab>evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his</ab>
<ab>brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy</ab>
<ab>nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not</ab>
<ab>worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,</ab>
<ab>Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and</ab>
<ab>his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of</ab>
<ab>him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I say, this Ajax--</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Ajax offers to beat him</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Nay, good Ajax.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Has not so much wit--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Nay, I must hold you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he</ab>
<ab>comes to fight.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Peace, fool!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will</ab>
<ab>not: he there: that he: look you there.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>O thou damned cur! I shall--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Will you set your wit to a fool's?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Good words, Thersites.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What's the quarrel?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the</ab>
<ab>proclamation, and he rails upon me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I serve thee not.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Well, go to, go to.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I serve here voluntarily.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not</ab>
<ab>voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was</ab>
<ab>here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your</ab>
<ab>sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great</ab>
<ab>catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'</ab>
<ab>were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What, with me too, Thersites?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy</ab>
<ab>ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you</ab>
<ab>like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What, what?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>I shall cut out your tongue.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou</ab>
<ab>afterwards.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>No more words, Thersites; peace!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>There's for you, Patroclus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come</ab>
<ab>any more to your tents: I will keep where there is</ab>
<ab>wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.</ab>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>A good riddance.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:</ab>
<ab>That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,</ab>
<ab>Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy</ab>
<ab>To-morrow morning call some knight to arms</ab>
<ab>That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare</ab>
<ab>Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Farewell. Who shall answer him?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise</ab>
<ab>He knew his man.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE II.  Troy. A room in Priam's palace.</head>
<stage>Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>PRIAM</speaker>

<ab>After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,</ab>
<ab>Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:</ab>
<ab>'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--</ab>
<ab>As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,</ab>
<ab>Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed</ab>
<ab>In hot digestion of this cormorant war--</ab>
<ab>Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I</ab>
<ab>As far as toucheth my particular,</ab>
<ab>Yet, dread Priam,</ab>
<ab>There is no lady of more softer bowels,</ab>
<ab>More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,</ab>
<ab>More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'</ab>
<ab>Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,</ab>
<ab>Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd</ab>
<ab>The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches</ab>
<ab>To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:</ab>
<ab>Since the first sword was drawn about this question,</ab>
<ab>Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,</ab>
<ab>Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:</ab>
<ab>If we have lost so many tenths of ours,</ab>
<ab>To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,</ab>
<ab>Had it our name, the value of one ten,</ab>
<ab>What merit's in that reason which denies</ab>
<ab>The yielding of her up?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Fie, fie, my brother!</ab>
<ab>Weigh you the worth and honour of a king</ab>
<ab>So great as our dread father in a scale</ab>
<ab>Of common ounces? will you with counters sum</ab>
<ab>The past proportion of his infinite?</ab>
<ab>And buckle in a waist most fathomless</ab>
<ab>With spans and inches so diminutive</ab>
<ab>As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELENUS</speaker>

<ab>No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,</ab>
<ab>You are so empty of them. Should not our father</ab>
<ab>Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,</ab>
<ab>Because your speech hath none that tells him so?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;</ab>
<ab>You fur your gloves with reason. Here are</ab>
<ab>your reasons:</ab>
<ab>You know an enemy intends you harm;</ab>
<ab>You know a sword employ'd is perilous,</ab>
<ab>And reason flies the object of all harm:</ab>
<ab>Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds</ab>
<ab>A Grecian and his sword, if he do set</ab>
<ab>The very wings of reason to his heels</ab>
<ab>And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,</ab>
<ab>Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,</ab>
<ab>Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour</ab>
<ab>Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat</ab>
<ab>their thoughts</ab>
<ab>With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect</ab>
<ab>Make livers pale and lustihood deject.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost</ab>
<ab>The holding.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>What is aught, but as 'tis valued?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>But value dwells not in particular will;</ab>
<ab>It holds his estimate and dignity</ab>
<ab>As well wherein 'tis precious of itself</ab>
<ab>As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry</ab>

<ab>I take to-day a wife, and my election</ab>
<ab>Is led on in the conduct of my will;</ab>
<ab>My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,</ab>
<ab>Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores</ab>
<ab>Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,</ab>
<ab>Although my will distaste what it elected,</ab>
<ab>The wife I chose? there can be no evasion</ab>
<ab>To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:</ab>
<ab>We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,</ab>
<ab>When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands</ab>
<ab>We do not throw in unrespective sieve,</ab>
<ab>Because we now are full. It was thought meet</ab>
<ab>Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:</ab>
<ab>Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;</ab>
<ab>The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce</ab>
<ab>And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,</ab>
<ab>And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,</ab>
<ab>He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness</ab>
<ab>Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.</ab>
<ab>Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:</ab>
<ab>Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,</ab>
<ab>Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,</ab>
<ab>And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.</ab>
<ab>If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--</ab>
<ab>As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--</ab>
<ab>If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--</ab>
<ab>As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands</ab>
<ab>And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now</ab>
<ab>The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,</ab>
<ab>And do a deed that fortune never did,</ab>
<ab>Beggar the estimation which you prized</ab>
<ab>Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,</ab>
<ab>That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!</ab>
<ab>But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,</ab>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains</ab>
<ab>Of divination in our sister work</ab>
<ab>Some touches of remorse? or is your blood</ab>
<ab>So madly hot that no discourse of reason,</ab>
<ab>Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,</ab>
<ab>Can qualify the same?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Why, brother Hector,</ab>
<ab>We may not think the justness of each act</ab>
<ab>Such and no other than event doth form it,</ab>
<ab>Nor once deject the courage of our minds,</ab>
<ab>Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures</ab>
<ab>Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel</ab>
<ab>Which hath our several honours all engaged</ab>
<ab>To make it gracious. For my private part,</ab>
<ab>I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:</ab>
<ab>And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us</ab>
<ab>Such things as might offend the weakest spleen</ab>
<ab>To fight for and maintain!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Else might the world convince of levity</ab>
<ab>As well my undertakings as your counsels:</ab>
<ab>But I attest the gods, your full consent</ab>
<ab>Gave wings to my propension and cut off</ab>
<ab>All fears attending on so dire a project.</ab>
<ab>For what, alas, can these my single arms?</ab>
<ab>What Propugnation is in one man's valour,</ab>
<ab>To stand the push and enmity of those</ab>
<ab>This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,</ab>
<ab>Were I alone to pass the difficulties</ab>
<ab>And had as ample power as I have will,</ab>
<ab>Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,</ab>
<ab>Nor faint in the pursuit.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PRIAM</speaker>

<ab>Paris, you speak</ab>
<ab>Like one besotted on your sweet delights:</ab>
<ab>You have the honey still, but these the gall;</ab>
<ab>So to be valiant is no praise at all.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Sir, I propose not merely to myself</ab>
<ab>The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;</ab>
<ab>But I would have the soil of her fair rape</ab>
<ab>Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.</ab>
<ab>What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,</ab>
<ab>Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,</ab>
<ab>Now to deliver her possession up</ab>
<ab>On terms of base compulsion! Can it be</ab>
<ab>That so degenerate a strain as this</ab>
<ab>Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?</ab>
<ab>There's not the meanest spirit on our party</ab>
<ab>Without a heart to dare or sword to draw</ab>
<ab>When Helen is defended, nor none so noble</ab>
<ab>Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed</ab>
<ab>Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,</ab>
<ab>Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,</ab>
<ab>The world's large spaces cannot parallel.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,</ab>
<ab>And on the cause and question now in hand</ab>
<ab>Have glozed, but superficially: not much</ab>
<ab>Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought</ab>
<ab>Unfit to hear moral philosophy:</ab>
<ab>The reasons you allege do more conduce</ab>
<ab>To the hot passion of distemper'd blood</ab>
<ab>Than to make up a free determination</ab>
<ab>'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge</ab>
<ab>Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice</ab>
<ab>Of any true decision. Nature craves</ab>
<ab>All dues be render'd to their owners: now,</ab>
<ab>What nearer debt in all humanity</ab>
<ab>Than wife is to the husband? If this law</ab>
<ab>Of nature be corrupted through affection,</ab>
<ab>And that great minds, of partial indulgence</ab>
<ab>To their benumbed wills, resist the same,</ab>
<ab>There is a law in each well-order'd nation</ab>
<ab>To curb those raging appetites that are</ab>
<ab>Most disobedient and refractory.</ab>
<ab>If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,</ab>
<ab>As it is known she is, these moral laws</ab>
<ab>Of nature and of nations speak aloud</ab>
<ab>To have her back return'd: thus to persist</ab>
<ab>In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,</ab>
<ab>But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion</ab>
<ab>Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,</ab>
<ab>My spritely brethren, I propend to you</ab>
<ab>In resolution to keep Helen still,</ab>
<ab>For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance</ab>
<ab>Upon our joint and several dignities.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:</ab>
<ab>Were it not glory that we more affected</ab>
<ab>Than the performance of our heaving spleens,</ab>
<ab>I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood</ab>
<ab>Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,</ab>
<ab>She is a theme of honour and renown,</ab>
<ab>A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,</ab>
<ab>Whose present courage may beat down our foes,</ab>
<ab>And fame in time to come canonize us;</ab>
<ab>For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose</ab>
<ab>So rich advantage of a promised glory</ab>
<ab>As smiles upon the forehead of this action</ab>
<ab>For the wide world's revenue.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I am yours,</ab>
<ab>You valiant offspring of great Priamus.</ab>
<ab>I have a roisting challenge sent amongst</ab>
<ab>The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks</ab>
<ab>Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:</ab>

<ab>This, I presume, will wake him.</ab>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of</ab>
<ab>thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He</ab>
<ab>beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!</ab>
<ab>would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,</ab>
<ab>whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to</ab>
<ab>conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of</ab>
<ab>my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a</ab>
<ab>rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two</ab>
<ab>undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of</ab>
<ab>themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,</ab>
<ab>forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,</ab>
<ab>Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy</ab>
<ab>caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less</ab>
<ab>than little wit from them that they have! which</ab>
<ab>short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant</ab>
<ab>scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly</ab>
<ab>from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and</ab>
<ab>cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the</ab>
<ab>whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,</ab>
<ab>methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war</ab>
<ab>for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy</ab>

<ab>If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou</ab>
<ab>wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but</ab>
<ab>it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common</ab>
<ab>curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in</ab>
<ab>great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and</ab>
<ab>discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy</ab>
<ab>direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee</ab>

<ab>Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,</ab>

</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>O, tell, tell.</ab>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands</ab>
<ab>Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'</ab>

<ab>No, you see, he is his argument that has his</ab>
<ab>argument, Achilles.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>All the better; their fraction is more our wish than</ab>
<ab>their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool</ab>
<ab>could disunite.</ab>

<ab>The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:</ab>
<ab>his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.</ab>

<ab>Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,</ab>
<ab>If any thing more than your sport and pleasure</ab>
<ab>Did move your greatness and this noble state</ab>
<ab>To call upon him; he hopes it is no other</ab>
<ab>But for your health and your digestion sake,</ab>
<ab>And after-dinner's breath.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Hear you, Patroclus:</ab>
<ab>We are too well acquainted with these answers:</ab>
<ab>But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,</ab>
<ab>Cannot outfly our apprehensions.</ab>
<ab>Much attribute he hath, and much the reason</ab>
<ab>Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,</ab>
<ab>Not virtuously on his own part beheld,</ab>
<ab>Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,</ab>
<ab>Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,</ab>
<ab>Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,</ab>
<ab>We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,</ab>
<ab>If you do say we think him over-proud</ab>
<ab>And under-honest, in self-assumption greater</ab>
<ab>Than in the note of judgment; and worthier</ab>
<ab>than himself</ab>
<ab>Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,</ab>
<ab>Disguise the holy strength of their command,</ab>
<ab>And underwrite in an observing kind</ab>
<ab>His humorous predominance; yea, watch</ab>
<ab>His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if</ab>
<ab>The passage and whole carriage of this action</ab>
<ab>Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,</ab>
<ab>That if he overhold his price so much,</ab>
<ab>We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine</ab>
<ab>Not portable, lie under this report:</ab>
<ab>'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:</ab>
<ab>A stirring dwarf we do allowance give</ab>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a</ab>

</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>No question.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as</ab>
<ab>wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether</ab>
<ab>more tractable.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I</ab>
<ab>know not what pride is.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the</ab>
<ab>fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is</ab>
<ab>his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;</ab>
<ab>and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours</ab>
<ab>the deed in the praise.</ab>

<ab>He will be the physician that should be the patient.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>An all men were o' my mind,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Wit would be out of fashion.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:</ab>
<ab>shall pride carry it?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>An 'twould, you'ld carry half.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>A' would have ten shares.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>I will knead him; I'll make him supple.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:</ab>
<ab>pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab><stage>To AGAMEMNON</stage>  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Our noble general, do not do so.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>You must prepare to fight without Achilles.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.</ab>
<ab>Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;</ab>
<ab>I will be silent.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Wherefore should you so?</ab>
<ab>He is not emulous, as Achilles is.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Know the whole world, he is as valiant.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!</ab>
<ab>Would he were a Trojan!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>What a vice were it in Ajax now,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>If he were proud,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Or covetous of praise,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Ay, or surly borne,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Or strange, or self-affected!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;</ab>
<ab>Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:</ab>
<ab>Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature</ab>
<ab>Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:</ab>
<ab>But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,</ab>
<ab>Let Mars divide eternity in twain,</ab>
<ab>And give him half: and, for thy vigour,</ab>
<ab>Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield</ab>
<ab>To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,</ab>
<ab>Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines</ab>
<ab>Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;</ab>
<ab>Instructed by the antiquary times,</ab>
<ab>He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:</ab>
<ab>Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days</ab>
<ab>As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,</ab>
<ab>You should not have the eminence of him,</ab>
<ab>But be as Ajax.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Shall I call you father?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Ay, my good son.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles</ab>
<ab>Keeps thicket. Please it our great general</ab>
<ab>To call together all his state of war;</ab>
<ab>Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow</ab>
<ab>We must with all our main of power stand fast:</ab>
<ab>And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,</ab>
<ab>And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:</ab>
<ab>Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.</ab>

<stage>Enter a Servant and PANDARUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow</ab>
<ab>the young Lord Paris?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>Ay, sir, when he goes before me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You depend upon him, I mean?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>Sir, I do depend upon the lord.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs</ab>
<ab>praise him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>The lord be praised!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You know me, do you not?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>Faith, sir, superficially.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>I hope I shall know your honour better.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I do desire it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>You are in the state of grace.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.</ab>
<stage>Music within</stage>
<ab>What music is this?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Know you the musicians?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>Wholly, sir.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Who play they to?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>To the hearers, sir.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>At whose pleasure, friend</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Command, I mean, friend.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>Who shall I command, sir?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Friend, we understand not one another: I am too</ab>
<ab>courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request</ab>
<ab>do these men play?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request</ab>
<ab>of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,</ab>
<ab>the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's</ab>
<ab>invisible soul,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Who, my cousin Cressida?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her</ab>
<ab>attributes?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the</ab>
<ab>Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the</ab>
<ab>Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault</ab>
<ab>upon him, for my business seethes.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Servant</speaker>

<ab>Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair</ab>
<ab>company! fair desires, in all fair measure,</ab>
<ab>fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!</ab>
<ab>fair thoughts be your fair pillow!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>Dear lord, you are full of fair words.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair</ab>
<ab>prince, here is good broken music.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you</ab>
<ab>shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out</ab>
<ab>with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full</ab>
<ab>of harmony.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Truly, lady, no.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>O, sir,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,</ab>
<ab>will you vouchsafe me a word?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you</ab>
<ab>sing, certainly.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,</ab>
<ab>marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed</ab>
<ab>friend, your brother Troilus,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most</ab>
<ab>affectionately to you,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,</ab>
<ab>our melancholy upon your head!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,</ab>
<ab>in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,</ab>
<ab>no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king</ab>
<ab>call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>My Lord Pandarus,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>Nay, but, my lord,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out</ab>
<ab>with you. You must not know where he sups.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your</ab>
<ab>disposer is sick.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Well, I'll make excuse.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,</ab>
<ab>your poor disposer's sick.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>I spy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an</ab>
<ab>instrument. Now, sweet queen.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>Why, this is kindly done.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,</ab>
<ab>sweet queen.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing</ab>
<ab>you a song now.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou</ab>
<ab>hast a fine forehead.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, you may, you may.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.</ab>
<ab>O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>In good troth, it begins so.</ab>
<stage>Sings</stage>
<ab>Love, love, nothing but love, still more!</ab>
<ab>For, O, love's bow</ab>
<ab>Shoots buck and doe:</ab>
<ab>The shaft confounds,</ab>
<ab>Not that it wounds,</ab>
<ab>But tickles still the sore.</ab>
<ab>These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!</ab>
<ab>Yet that which seems the wound to kill,</ab>
<ab>Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!</ab>
<ab>So dying love lives still:</ab>
<ab>Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!</ab>
<ab>Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!</ab>
<ab>Heigh-ho!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot</ab>
<ab>blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot</ab>
<ab>thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot</ab>
<ab>thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:</ab>
<ab>is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's</ab>
<ab>a-field to-day?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the</ab>
<ab>gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,</ab>
<ab>but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my</ab>
<ab>brother Troilus went not?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they</ab>
<ab>sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>To a hair.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Farewell, sweet queen.</ab>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,</ab>
<ab>To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you</ab>
<ab>To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,</ab>
<ab>With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,</ab>
<ab>Shall more obey than to the edge of steel</ab>
<ab>Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more</ab>
<ab>Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HELEN</speaker>

<ab>'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;</ab>
<ab>Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty</ab>
<ab>Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,</ab>
<ab>Yea, overshines ourself.</ab>

<stage>Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>How now! where's thy master? at my cousin</ab>
<ab>Cressida's?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>Boy</speaker>

<ab>No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>O, here he comes.</ab>
<stage>Enter TROILUS</stage>
<ab>How now, how now!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Sirrah, walk off.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit Boy</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Have you seen my cousin?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,</ab>
<ab>Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks</ab>
<ab>Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,</ab>
<ab>And give me swift transportance to those fields</ab>
<ab>Where I may wallow in the lily-beds</ab>
<ab>Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,</ab>
<ab>From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings</ab>
<ab>And fly with me to Cressid!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.</ab>
<ab>The imaginary relish is so sweet</ab>
<ab>That it enchants my sense: what will it be,</ab>
<ab>When that the watery palate tastes indeed</ab>
<ab>Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,</ab>
<ab>Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,</ab>
<ab>Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,</ab>
<ab>For the capacity of my ruder powers:</ab>
<ab>I fear it much; and I do fear besides,</ab>
<ab>That I shall lose distinction in my joys;</ab>
<ab>As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps</ab>
<ab>The enemy flying.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Re-enter PANDARUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you</ab>
<ab>must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches</ab>
<ab>her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a</ab>
<ab>sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest</ab>
<ab>villain: she fetches her breath as short as a</ab>
<ab>new-ta'en sparrow.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:</ab>
<ab>My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;</ab>
<ab>And all my powers do their bestowing lose,</ab>
<ab>Like vassalage at unawares encountering</ab>
<ab>The eye of majesty.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.</ab>
<ab>Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that</ab>
<ab>you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?</ab>
<ab>you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?</ab>
<ab>Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,</ab>
<ab>we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to</ab>
<ab>her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your</ab>
<ab>picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend</ab>
<ab>daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.</ab>
<ab>So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!</ab>
<ab>a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air</ab>
<ab>is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere</ab>
<ab>I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the</ab>
<ab>ducks i' the river: go to, go to.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>You have bereft me of all words, lady.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll</ab>
<ab>bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your</ab>
<ab>activity in question. What, billing again? Here's</ab>
<ab>'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--</ab>
<ab>Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Will you walk in, my lord?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>What should they grant? what makes this pretty</ab>
<ab>abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet</ab>
<ab>lady in the fountain of our love?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer</ab>
<ab>footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to</ab>
<ab>fear the worst oft cures the worse.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's</ab>
<ab>pageant there is presented no monster.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Nor nothing monstrous neither?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep</ab>
<ab>seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking</ab>
<ab>it harder for our mistress to devise imposition</ab>
<ab>enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.</ab>
<ab>This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will</ab>
<ab>is infinite and the execution confined, that the</ab>
<ab>desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>They say all lovers swear more performance than they</ab>
<ab>are able and yet reserve an ability that they never</ab>
<ab>perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and</ab>
<ab>discharging less than the tenth part of one. They</ab>
<ab>that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,</ab>
<ab>are they not monsters?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we</ab>
<ab>are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go</ab>
<ab>bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion</ab>
<ab>shall have a praise in present: we will not name</ab>
<ab>desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition</ab>
<ab>shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus</ab>
<ab>shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst</ab>
<ab>shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can</ab>
<ab>speak truest not truer than Troilus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Will you walk in, my lord?</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Re-enter PANDARUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,</ab>
<ab>you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he</ab>
<ab>flinch, chide me for it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my</ab>
<ab>firm faith.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,</ab>
<ab>though they be long ere they are wooed, they are</ab>
<ab>constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;</ab>
<ab>they'll stick where they are thrown.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.</ab>
<ab>Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day</ab>
<ab>For many weary months.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,</ab>
<ab>With the first glance that ever--pardon me--</ab>
<ab>If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.</ab>
<ab>I love you now; but not, till now, so much</ab>
<ab>But I might master it: in faith, I lie;</ab>
<ab>My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown</ab>
<ab>Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!</ab>
<ab>Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,</ab>
<ab>When we are so unsecret to ourselves?</ab>
<ab>But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;</ab>
<ab>And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,</ab>
<ab>Or that we women had men's privilege</ab>
<ab>Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,</ab>
<ab>For in this rapture I shall surely speak</ab>
<ab>The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,</ab>
<ab>Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws</ab>
<ab>My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Pretty, i' faith.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;</ab>
<ab>'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:</ab>
<ab>I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?</ab>
<ab>For this time will I take my leave, my lord.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Your leave, sweet Cressid!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Pray you, content you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>What offends you, lady?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Sir, mine own company.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>You cannot shun Yourself.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Let me go and try:</ab>
<ab>I have a kind of self resides with you;</ab>
<ab>But an unkind self, that itself will leave,</ab>
<ab>To be another's fool. I would be gone:</ab>
<ab>Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;</ab>
<ab>And fell so roundly to a large confession,</ab>
<ab>To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,</ab>
<ab>Or else you love not, for to be wise and love</ab>
<ab>Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O that I thought it could be in a woman--</ab>
<ab>As, if it can, I will presume in you--</ab>
<ab>To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;</ab>
<ab>To keep her constancy in plight and youth,</ab>
<ab>Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind</ab>
<ab>That doth renew swifter than blood decays!</ab>
<ab>Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,</ab>
<ab>That my integrity and truth to you</ab>
<ab>Might be affronted with the match and weight</ab>
<ab>Of such a winnow'd purity in love;</ab>
<ab>How were I then uplifted! but, alas!</ab>
<ab>I am as true as truth's simplicity</ab>
<ab>And simpler than the infancy of truth.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>In that I'll war with you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O virtuous fight,</ab>
<ab>When right with right wars who shall be most right!</ab>
<ab>True swains in love shall in the world to come</ab>
<ab>Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,</ab>
<ab>Full of protest, of oath and big compare,</ab>
<ab>Want similes, truth tired with iteration,</ab>
<ab>As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,</ab>
<ab>As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,</ab>
<ab>As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,</ab>
<ab>Yet, after all comparisons of truth,</ab>
<ab>As truth's authentic author to be cited,</ab>
<ab>'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,</ab>
<ab>And sanctify the numbers.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Prophet may you be!</ab>
<ab>If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,</ab>
<ab>When time is old and hath forgot itself,</ab>
<ab>When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,</ab>
<ab>And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,</ab>
<ab>And mighty states characterless are grated</ab>
<ab>To dusty nothing, yet let memory,</ab>
<ab>From false to false, among false maids in love,</ab>
<ab>Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false</ab>
<ab>As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,</ab>
<ab>As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,</ab>
<ab>Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'</ab>
<ab>'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,</ab>
<ab>'As false as Cressid.'</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the</ab>
<ab>witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.</ab>
<ab>If ever you prove false one to another, since I have</ab>
<ab>taken such pains to bring you together, let all</ab>
<ab>pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end</ab>
<ab>after my name; call them all Pandars; let all</ab>
<ab>constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,</ab>
<ab>and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Amen.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Amen.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a</ab>
<ab>bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your</ab>
<ab>pretty encounters, press it to death: away!</ab>
<ab>And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here</ab>
<ab>Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE III.  The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.</head>
<stage>Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX,
MENELAUS, and CALCHAS</stage>

<sp><speaker>CALCHAS</speaker>

<ab>Now, princes, for the service I have done you,</ab>
<ab>The advantage of the time prompts me aloud</ab>
<ab>To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind</ab>
<ab>That, through the sight I bear in things to love,</ab>
<ab>I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,</ab>
<ab>Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,</ab>
<ab>From certain and possess'd conveniences,</ab>
<ab>To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all</ab>
<ab>That time, acquaintance, custom and condition</ab>
<ab>Made tame and most familiar to my nature,</ab>
<ab>And here, to do you service, am become</ab>
<ab>As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:</ab>
<ab>I do beseech you, as in way of taste,</ab>
<ab>To give me now a little benefit,</ab>
<ab>Out of those many register'd in promise,</ab>
<ab>Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CALCHAS</speaker>

<ab>You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,</ab>
<ab>Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.</ab>
<ab>Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--</ab>
<ab>Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,</ab>
<ab>Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,</ab>
<ab>I know, is such a wrest in their affairs</ab>
<ab>That their negotiations all must slack,</ab>
<ab>Wanting his manage; and they will almost</ab>
<ab>Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,</ab>
<ab>In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,</ab>
<ab>And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence</ab>
<ab>Shall quite strike off all service I have done,</ab>
<ab>In most accepted pain.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Let Diomedes bear him,</ab>
<ab>And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have</ab>
<ab>What he requests of us. Good Diomed,</ab>
<ab>Furnish you fairly for this interchange:</ab>
<ab>Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow</ab>
<ab>Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden</ab>
<ab>Which I am proud to bear.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS</stage>
<stage>Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent</stage>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:</ab>
<ab>Please it our general to pass strangely by him,</ab>
<ab>As if he were forgot; and, princes all,</ab>
<ab>Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:</ab>
<ab>I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me</ab>
<ab>Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:</ab>
<ab>If so, I have derision medicinable,</ab>
<ab>To use between your strangeness and his pride,</ab>
<ab>Which his own will shall have desire to drink:</ab>
<ab>It may be good: pride hath no other glass</ab>
<ab>To show itself but pride, for supple knees</ab>
<ab>Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>We'll execute your purpose, and put on</ab>
<ab>A form of strangeness as we pass along:</ab>
<ab>So do each lord, and either greet him not,</ab>
<ab>Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more</ab>
<ab>Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What, comes the general to speak with me?</ab>
<ab>You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>What says Achilles? would he aught with us?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Would you, my lord, aught with the general?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>No.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Nothing, my lord.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>The better.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Good day, good day.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>How do you? how do you?</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What, does the cuckold scorn me?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>How now, Patroclus!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Good morrow, Ajax.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Ha?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Good morrow.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Ay, and good next day too.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>They pass by strangely: they were used to bend</ab>
<ab>To send their smiles before them to Achilles;</ab>
<ab>To come as humbly as they used to creep</ab>
<ab>To holy altars.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What, am I poor of late?</ab>
<ab>'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,</ab>
<ab>Must fall out with men too: what the declined is</ab>
<ab>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</ab>
<ab>As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,</ab>
<ab>Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,</ab>
<ab>And not a man, for being simply man,</ab>
<ab>Hath any honour, but honour for those honours</ab>
<ab>That are without him, as place, riches, favour,</ab>
<ab>Prizes of accident as oft as merit:</ab>
<ab>Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,</ab>
<ab>The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,</ab>
<ab>Do one pluck down another and together</ab>
<ab>Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:</ab>
<ab>Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy</ab>
<ab>At ample point all that I did possess,</ab>
<ab>Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out</ab>
<ab>Something not worth in me such rich beholding</ab>
<ab>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;</ab>
<ab>I'll interrupt his reading.</ab>
<ab>How now Ulysses!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Now, great Thetis' son!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What are you reading?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>A strange fellow here</ab>
<ab>Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,</ab>
<ab>How much in having, or without or in,</ab>
<ab>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</ab>
<ab>Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;</ab>
<ab>As when his virtues shining upon others</ab>
<ab>Heat them and they retort that heat again</ab>
<ab>To the first giver.'</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>This is not strange, Ulysses.</ab>
<ab>The beauty that is borne here in the face</ab>
<ab>The bearer knows not, but commends itself</ab>
<ab>To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,</ab>
<ab>That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,</ab>
<ab>Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed</ab>
<ab>Salutes each other with each other's form;</ab>
<ab>For speculation turns not to itself,</ab>
<ab>Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there</ab>
<ab>Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>I do not strain at the position,--</ab>
<ab>It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;</ab>
<ab>Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves</ab>
<ab>That no man is the lord of any thing,</ab>
<ab>Though in and of him there be much consisting,</ab>
<ab>Till he communicate his parts to others:</ab>
<ab>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught</ab>
<ab>Till he behold them form'd in the applause</ab>
<ab>Where they're extended; who, like an arch,</ab>
<ab>reverberates</ab>
<ab>The voice again, or, like a gate of steel</ab>
<ab>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</ab>
<ab>His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;</ab>
<ab>And apprehended here immediately</ab>
<ab>The unknown Ajax.</ab>
<ab>Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,</ab>
<ab>That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are</ab>
<ab>Most abject in regard and dear in use!</ab>
<ab>What things again most dear in the esteem</ab>
<ab>And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--</ab>
<ab>An act that very chance doth throw upon him--</ab>
<ab>Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,</ab>
<ab>While some men leave to do!</ab>
<ab>How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,</ab>
<ab>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</ab>
<ab>How one man eats into another's pride,</ab>
<ab>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</ab>
<ab>To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already</ab>
<ab>They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,</ab>
<ab>As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast</ab>
<ab>And great Troy shrieking.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I do believe it; for they pass'd by me</ab>
<ab>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</ab>
<ab>Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</ab>
<ab>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</ab>
<ab>A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:</ab>
<ab>Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd</ab>
<ab>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</ab>
<ab>As done: perseverance, dear my lord,</ab>
<ab>Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang</ab>
<ab>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail</ab>
<ab>In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;</ab>
<ab>For honour travels in a strait so narrow,</ab>
<ab>Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;</ab>
<ab>For emulation hath a thousand sons</ab>
<ab>That one by one pursue: if you give way,</ab>
<ab>Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,</ab>
<ab>Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by</ab>
<ab>And leave you hindmost;</ab>
<ab>Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,</ab>
<ab>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</ab>
<ab>O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,</ab>
<ab>Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;</ab>
<ab>For time is like a fashionable host</ab>
<ab>That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,</ab>
<ab>And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,</ab>
<ab>Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,</ab>
<ab>And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not</ab>
<ab>virtue seek</ab>
<ab>Remuneration for the thing it was;</ab>
<ab>For beauty, wit,</ab>
<ab>High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,</ab>
<ab>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</ab>
<ab>To envious and calumniating time.</ab>
<ab>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</ab>
<ab>That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,</ab>
<ab>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</ab>
<ab>And give to dust that is a little gilt</ab>
<ab>More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.</ab>
<ab>The present eye praises the present object.</ab>
<ab>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</ab>
<ab>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</ab>
<ab>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</ab>
<ab>Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,</ab>
<ab>And still it might, and yet it may again,</ab>
<ab>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</ab>
<ab>And case thy reputation in thy tent;</ab>
<ab>Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,</ab>
<ab>Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves</ab>
<ab>And drave great Mars to faction.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Of this my privacy</ab>
<ab>I have strong reasons.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>But 'gainst your privacy</ab>
<ab>The reasons are more potent and heroical:</ab>
<ab>'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love</ab>
<ab>With one of Priam's daughters.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Ha! known!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Is that a wonder?</ab>
<ab>The providence that's in a watchful state</ab>
<ab>Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,</ab>
<ab>Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,</ab>
<ab>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,</ab>
<ab>Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.</ab>
<ab>There is a mystery--with whom relation</ab>
<ab>Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;</ab>
<ab>Which hath an operation more divine</ab>
<ab>Than breath or pen can give expressure to:</ab>
<ab>All the commerce that you have had with Troy</ab>
<ab>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;</ab>
<ab>And better would it fit Achilles much</ab>
<ab>To throw down Hector than Polyxena:</ab>
<ab>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,</ab>
<ab>When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,</ab>
<ab>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,</ab>
<ab>'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,</ab>
<ab>But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'</ab>
<ab>Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;</ab>
<ab>The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:</ab>
<ab>A woman impudent and mannish grown</ab>
<ab>Is not more loathed than an effeminate man</ab>
<ab>In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;</ab>
<ab>They think my little stomach to the war</ab>
<ab>And your great love to me restrains you thus:</ab>
<ab>Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid</ab>
<ab>Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,</ab>
<ab>And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,</ab>
<ab>Be shook to air.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Shall Ajax fight with Hector?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I see my reputation is at stake</ab>
<ab>My fame is shrewdly gored.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>O, then, beware;</ab>
<ab>Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:</ab>
<ab>Omission to do what is necessary</ab>
<ab>Seals a commission to a blank of danger;</ab>
<ab>And danger, like an ague, subtly taints</ab>
<ab>Even then when we sit idly in the sun.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:</ab>
<ab>I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him</ab>
<ab>To invite the Trojan lords after the combat</ab>
<ab>To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,</ab>
<ab>An appetite that I am sick withal,</ab>
<ab>To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,</ab>
<ab>To talk with him and to behold his visage,</ab>
<ab>Even to my full of view.</ab>
<stage>Enter THERSITES</stage>
<ab>A labour saved!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>A wonder!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>What?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>How so?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so</ab>
<ab>prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he</ab>
<ab>raves in saying nothing.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>How can that be?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride</ab>
<ab>and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no</ab>
<ab>arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:</ab>
<ab>bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should</ab>
<ab>say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'</ab>
<ab>and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire</ab>
<ab>in a flint, which will not show without knocking.</ab>
<ab>The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his</ab>
<ab>neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in</ab>
<ab>vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,</ab>
<ab>Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think</ab>
<ab>you of this man that takes me for the general? He's</ab>
<ab>grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.</ab>
<ab>A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both</ab>
<ab>sides, like a leather jerkin.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not</ab>
<ab>answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his</ab>
<ab>tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let</ab>
<ab>Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the</ab>
<ab>pageant of Ajax.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the</ab>
<ab>valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector</ab>
<ab>to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure</ab>
<ab>safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous</ab>
<ab>and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured</ab>
<ab>captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,</ab>

<ab>I come from the worthy Achilles,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Ha!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Hum!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.</ab>

<ab>Ay, my lord.</ab>

<ab>Ha!</ab>

<ab>What say you to't?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>God b' wi' you, with all my heart.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Your answer, sir.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will</ab>
<ab>go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me</ab>
<ab>ere he has me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Your answer, sir.</ab>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Fare you well, with all my heart.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in</ab>
<ab>him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know</ab>
<ab>not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo</ab>
<ab>get his sinews to make catlings on.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more</ab>
<ab>capable creature.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;</ab>
<ab>And I myself see not the bottom of it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

      <div><head>ACT IV</head>

<div><head>SCENE I.  Troy. A street.</head>
<stage>Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a
torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR,
DIOMEDES, and others, with torches</stage>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>See, ho! who is that there?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEIPHOBUS</speaker>

<ab>It is the Lord AEneas.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Is the prince there in person?</ab>
<ab>Had I so good occasion to lie long</ab>
<ab>As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business</ab>
<ab>Should rob my bed-mate of my company.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--</ab>
<ab>Witness the process of your speech, wherein</ab>
<ab>You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,</ab>
<ab>Did haunt you in the field.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Health to you, valiant sir,</ab>
<ab>During all question of the gentle truce;</ab>
<ab>But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance</ab>
<ab>As heart can think or courage execute.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>The one and other Diomed embraces.</ab>
<ab>Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!</ab>
<ab>But when contention and occasion meet,</ab>
<ab>By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life</ab>
<ab>With all my force, pursuit and policy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly</ab>
<ab>With his face backward. In humane gentleness,</ab>
<ab>Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,</ab>
<ab>Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,</ab>
<ab>No man alive can love in such a sort</ab>
<ab>The thing he means to kill more excellently.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,</ab>
<ab>If to my sword his fate be not the glory,</ab>
<ab>A thousand complete courses of the sun!</ab>
<ab>But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,</ab>
<ab>With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>We know each other well.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>We do; and long to know each other worse.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,</ab>
<ab>The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.</ab>
<ab>What business, lord, so early?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek</ab>
<ab>To Calchas' house, and there to render him,</ab>
<ab>For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:</ab>
<ab>Let's have your company, or, if you please,</ab>
<ab>Haste there before us: I constantly do think--</ab>
<ab>Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--</ab>
<ab>My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:</ab>
<ab>Rouse him and give him note of our approach.</ab>
<ab>With the whole quality wherefore: I fear</ab>
<ab>We shall be much unwelcome.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>That I assure you:</ab>
<ab>Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece</ab>
<ab>Than Cressid borne from Troy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>There is no help;</ab>
<ab>The bitter disposition of the time</ab>
<ab>Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Good morrow, all.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit with Servant</stage>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,</ab>
<ab>Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,</ab>
<ab>Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,</ab>
<ab>Myself or Menelaus?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Both alike:</ab>
<ab>He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,</ab>
<ab>Not making any scruple of her soilure,</ab>
<ab>With such a hell of pain and world of charge,</ab>
<ab>And you as well to keep her, that defend her,</ab>
<ab>Not palating the taste of her dishonour,</ab>
<ab>With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:</ab>
<ab>He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up</ab>
<ab>The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;</ab>
<ab>You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins</ab>
<ab>Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:</ab>
<ab>Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;</ab>
<ab>But he as he, the heavier for a whore.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>You are too bitter to your countrywoman.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:</ab>
<ab>For every false drop in her bawdy veins</ab>
<ab>A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple</ab>
<ab>Of her contaminated carrion weight,</ab>
<ab>A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,</ab>
<ab>She hath not given so many good words breath</ab>
<ab>As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,</ab>
<ab>Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:</ab>
<ab>But we in silence hold this virtue well,</ab>
<ab>We'll but commend what we intend to sell.</ab>
<ab>Here lies our way.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE II.  The same. Court of Pandarus' house.</head>
<stage>Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;</ab>
<ab>He shall unbolt the gates.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Trouble him not;</ab>
<ab>To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,</ab>
<ab>And give as soft attachment to thy senses</ab>
<ab>As infants' empty of all thought!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Good morrow, then.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>I prithee now, to bed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Are you a-weary of me?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O Cressida! but that the busy day,</ab>
<ab>Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,</ab>
<ab>And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,</ab>
<ab>I would not from thee.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Night hath been too brief.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays</ab>
<ab>As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love</ab>
<ab>With wings more momentary-swift than thought.</ab>
<ab>You will catch cold, and curse me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Prithee, tarry:</ab>
<ab>You men will never tarry.</ab>
<ab>O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,</ab>
<ab>And then you would have tarried. Hark!</ab>
<ab>there's one up.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab><stage>Within</stage>  What, 's all the doors open here?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>It is your uncle.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:</ab>
<ab>I shall have such a life!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter PANDARUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you</ab>
<ab>maid! where's my cousin Cressid?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!</ab>
<ab>You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>To do what? to do what? let her say</ab>
<ab>what: what have I brought you to do?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,</ab>
<ab>Nor suffer others.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!</ab>
<ab>hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty</ab>
<ab>man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!</ab>
<stage>Knocking within</stage>
<ab>Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.</ab>
<ab>My lord, come you again into my chamber:</ab>
<ab>You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Ha, ha!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.</ab>
<stage>Knocking within</stage>
<ab>How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:</ab>
<ab>I would not for half Troy have you seen here.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat</ab>

</sp>

<stage>Enter AENEAS</stage>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Good morrow, lord, good morrow.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,</ab>
<ab>I knew you not: what news with you so early?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Is not Prince Troilus here?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Here! what should he do here?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:</ab>
<ab>It doth import him much to speak with me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll</ab>
<ab>be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What</ab>
<ab>should he do here?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong</ab>
<ab>ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be</ab>
<ab>false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go</ab>
<ab>fetch him hither; go.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Re-enter TROILUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>How now! what's the matter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,</ab>
<ab>My matter is so rash: there is at hand</ab>
<ab>Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,</ab>
<ab>The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor</ab>
<ab>Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,</ab>
<ab>Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,</ab>
<ab>We must give up to Diomedes' hand</ab>
<ab>The Lady Cressida.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Is it so concluded?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>By Priam and the general state of Troy:</ab>
<ab>They are at hand and ready to effect it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>How my achievements mock me!</ab>
<ab>I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,</ab>
<ab>We met by chance; you did not find me here.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature</ab>
<ab>Have not more gift in taciturnity.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil</ab>
<ab>take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a</ab>
<ab>plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Re-enter CRESSIDA</stage>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>How now! what's the matter? who was here?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ah, ah!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!</ab>
<ab>Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>O the gods! what's the matter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been</ab>
<ab>born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor</ab>
<ab>gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,</ab>
<ab>what's the matter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou</ab>
<ab>art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,</ab>
<ab>and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;</ab>
<ab>'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>O you immortal gods! I will not go.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Thou must.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;</ab>
<ab>I know no touch of consanguinity;</ab>
<ab>No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me</ab>
<ab>As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!</ab>
<ab>Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,</ab>
<ab>If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,</ab>
<ab>Do to this body what extremes you can;</ab>
<ab>But the strong base and building of my love</ab>
<ab>Is as the very centre of the earth,</ab>
<ab>Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Do, do.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,</ab>
<ab>Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart</ab>
<ab>With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.</ab>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd</ab>

<ab>Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,</ab>
<ab>Tell you the lady what she is to do,</ab>
<ab>And haste her to the purpose.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Walk into her house;</ab>
<ab>I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:</ab>

<ab>Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus</ab>
<ab>A priest there offering to it his own heart.</ab>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Be moderate, be moderate.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Why tell you me of moderation?</ab>
<ab>The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,</ab>
<ab>And violenteth in a sense as strong</ab>
<ab>As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?</ab>
<ab>If I could temporize with my affection,</ab>
<ab>Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,</ab>
<ab>The like allayment could I give my grief.</ab>
<ab>My love admits no qualifying dross;</ab>
<ab>No more my grief, in such a precious loss.</ab>

<ab>Ah, sweet ducks!</ab>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>What a pair of spectacles is here!</ab>
<ab>Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,</ab>
<ab>'--O heart, heavy heart,</ab>
<ab>Why sigh'st thou without breaking?</ab>
<ab>where he answers again,</ab>
<ab>'Because thou canst not ease thy smart</ab>
<ab>By friendship nor by speaking.'</ab>
<ab>There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away</ab>
<ab>nothing, for we may live to have need of such a</ab>
<ab>verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,</ab>
<ab>That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,</ab>
<ab>More bright in zeal than the devotion which</ab>
<ab>Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Have the gods envy?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>And is it true that I must go from Troy?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>A hateful truth.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>What, and from Troilus too?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>From Troy and Troilus.</ab>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Is it possible?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>And suddenly; where injury of chance</ab>
<ab>Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by</ab>
<ab>All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips</ab>
<ab>Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents</ab>
<ab>Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows</ab>
<ab>Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:</ab>
<ab>We two, that with so many thousand sighs</ab>
<ab>Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves</ab>
<ab>With the rude brevity and discharge of one.</ab>
<ab>Injurious time now with a robber's haste</ab>
<ab>Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:</ab>
<ab>As many farewells as be stars in heaven,</ab>
<ab>With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,</ab>
<ab>He fumbles up into a lose adieu,</ab>

</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,</ab>
<ab>For it is parting from us:</ab>
<ab>I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,</ab>
<ab>For I will throw my glove to Death himself,</ab>
<ab>That there's no maculation in thy heart:</ab>
<ab>But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in</ab>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Hear while I speak it, love:</ab>
<ab>The Grecian youths are full of quality;</ab>
<ab>They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,</ab>
<ab>Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:</ab>
<ab>How novelty may move, and parts with person,</ab>
<ab>Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--</ab>
<ab>Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--</ab>
<ab>Makes me afeard.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>O heavens! you love me not.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Die I a villain, then!</ab>
<ab>In this I do not call your faith in question</ab>
<ab>So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,</ab>
<ab>Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,</ab>
<ab>Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,</ab>
<ab>To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:</ab>
<ab>But I can tell that in each grace of these</ab>
<ab>There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil</ab>
<ab>That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Do you think I will?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>No.</ab>
<ab>But something may be done that we will not:</ab>
<ab>And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,</ab>
<ab>When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,</ab>
<ab>Presuming on their changeful potency.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab><stage>Within</stage>  Nay, good my lord,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Come, kiss; and let us part.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab><stage>Within</stage>  Brother Troilus!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Good brother, come you hither;</ab>
<ab>And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>My lord, will you be true?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:</ab>
<ab>Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,</ab>
<ab>I with great truth catch mere simplicity;</ab>
<ab>Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,</ab>
<ab>With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.</ab>
<ab>Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit</ab>
<ab>Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.</ab>
<stage>Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS,
and DIOMEDES</stage>
<ab>Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady</ab>
<ab>Which for Antenor we deliver you:</ab>
<ab>At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,</ab>
<ab>And by the way possess thee what she is.</ab>
<ab>Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,</ab>
<ab>If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,</ab>
<ab>Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe</ab>
<ab>As Priam is in Ilion.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Fair Lady Cressid,</ab>
<ab>So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:</ab>
<ab>The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,</ab>
<ab>Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed</ab>
<ab>You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,</ab>
<ab>To shame the zeal of my petition to thee</ab>
<ab>In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,</ab>
<ab>She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises</ab>
<ab>As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.</ab>
<ab>I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;</ab>
<ab>For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,</ab>
<ab>Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,</ab>
<ab>I'll cut thy throat.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:</ab>
<ab>Let me be privileged by my place and message,</ab>
<ab>To be a speaker free; when I am hence</ab>
<ab>I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,</ab>
<ab>I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth</ab>
<ab>She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'</ab>
<ab>I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,</ab>
<ab>This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.</ab>
<ab>Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,</ab>
<ab>To our own selves bend we our needful talk.</ab>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>Hark! Hector's trumpet.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>How have we spent this morning!</ab>
<ab>The prince must think me tardy and remiss,</ab>
<ab>That sore to ride before him to the field.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PARIS</speaker>

<ab>'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEIPHOBUS</speaker>

<ab>Let us make ready straight.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,</ab>
<ab>Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:</ab>
<ab>The glory of our Troy doth this day lie</ab>
<ab>On his fair worth and single chivalry.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE V.  The Grecian camp. Lists set out.</head>
<stage>Enter AJAX, armed; AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS,
MENELAUS, ULYSSES, NESTOR, and others</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,</ab>
<ab>Anticipating time with starting courage.</ab>
<ab>Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,</ab>
<ab>Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air</ab>
<ab>May pierce the head of the great combatant</ab>
<ab>And hale him hither.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.</ab>
<ab>Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:</ab>
<ab>Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek</ab>
<ab>Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:</ab>
<ab>Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;</ab>
<ab>Thou blow'st for Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Trumpet sounds</stage>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>No trumpet answers.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>'Tis but early days.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;</ab>
<ab>He rises on the toe: that spirit of his</ab>
<ab>In aspiration lifts him from the earth.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Is this the Lady Cressid?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Even she.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Our general doth salute you with a kiss.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Yet is the kindness but particular;</ab>
<ab>'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.</ab>
<ab>So much for Nestor.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:</ab>
<ab>Achilles bids you welcome.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>I had good argument for kissing once.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>But that's no argument for kissing now;</ab>
<ab>For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,</ab>
<ab>And parted thus you and your argument.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!</ab>
<ab>For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:</ab>
<ab>Patroclus kisses you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>O, this is trim!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Paris and I kiss evermore for him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>In kissing, do you render or receive?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Both take and give.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>I'll make my match to live,</ab>
<ab>The kiss you take is better than you give;</ab>
<ab>Therefore no kiss.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>You're an odd man; give even or give none.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>An odd man, lady! every man is odd.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,</ab>
<ab>That you are odd, and he is even with you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>You fillip me o' the head.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>No, I'll be sworn.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>It were no match, your nail against his horn.</ab>
<ab>May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>You may.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>I do desire it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Why, beg, then.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,</ab>
<ab>When Helen is a maid again, and his.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit with CRESSIDA</stage>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>A woman of quick sense.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Fie, fie upon her!</ab>
<ab>There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,</ab>
<ab>Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out</ab>
<ab>At every joint and motive of her body.</ab>
<ab>O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,</ab>
<ab>That give accosting welcome ere it comes,</ab>
<ab>And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts</ab>
<ab>To every ticklish reader! set them down</ab>
<ab>For sluttish spoils of opportunity</ab>
<ab>And daughters of the game.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Trumpet within</stage>

<sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>

<ab>The Trojans' trumpet.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Yonder comes the troop.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other
Trojans, with Attendants</stage>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done</ab>
<ab>To him that victory commands? or do you purpose</ab>
<ab>A victor shall be known? will you the knights</ab>
<ab>Shall to the edge of all extremity</ab>
<ab>Pursue each other, or shall be divided</ab>
<ab>By any voice or order of the field?</ab>
<ab>Hector bade ask.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Which way would Hector have it?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>He cares not; he'll obey conditions.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,</ab>
<ab>A little proudly, and great deal misprizing</ab>
<ab>The knight opposed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>If not Achilles, sir,</ab>
<ab>What is your name?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>If not Achilles, nothing.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:</ab>
<ab>In the extremity of great and little,</ab>
<ab>Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;</ab>
<ab>The one almost as infinite as all,</ab>
<ab>The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,</ab>
<ab>And that which looks like pride is courtesy.</ab>
<ab>This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:</ab>
<ab>In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;</ab>
<ab>Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek</ab>
<ab>This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Re-enter DIOMEDES</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,</ab>
<ab>Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas</ab>
<ab>Consent upon the order of their fight,</ab>
<ab>So be it; either to the uttermost,</ab>
<ab>Or else a breath: the combatants being kin</ab>
<ab>Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists</stage>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>They are opposed already.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,</ab>
<ab>Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,</ab>
<ab>Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;</ab>
<ab>Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:</ab>
<ab>His heart and hand both open and both free;</ab>
<ab>For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;</ab>
<ab>Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,</ab>
<ab>Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;</ab>
<ab>Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;</ab>
<ab>For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes</ab>
<ab>To tender objects, but he in heat of action</ab>
<ab>Is more vindicative than jealous love:</ab>
<ab>They call him Troilus, and on him erect</ab>
<ab>A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.</ab>
<ab>Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth</ab>
<ab>Even to his inches, and with private soul</ab>
<ab>Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>They are in action.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Now, Ajax, hold thine own!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Hector, thou sleep'st;</ab>
<ab>Awake thee!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>You must no more.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Trumpets cease</stage>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Princes, enough, so please you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>I am not warm yet; let us fight again.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>As Hector pleases.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Why, then will I no more:</ab>
<ab>Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,</ab>
<ab>A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;</ab>
<ab>The obligation of our blood forbids</ab>
<ab>A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:</ab>
<ab>Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so</ab>
<ab>That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,</ab>
<ab>And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg</ab>
<ab>All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood</ab>
<ab>Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister</ab>
<ab>Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,</ab>
<ab>Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member</ab>
<ab>Wherein my sword had not impressure made</ab>
<ab>Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay</ab>
<ab>That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,</ab>
<ab>My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword</ab>
<ab>Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:</ab>
<ab>By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;</ab>
<ab>Hector would have them fall upon him thus:</ab>
<ab>Cousin, all honour to thee!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>I thank thee, Hector</ab>
<ab>Thou art too gentle and too free a man:</ab>
<ab>I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence</ab>
<ab>A great addition earned in thy death.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Not Neoptolemus so mirable,</ab>
<ab>On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes</ab>
<ab>Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself</ab>
<ab>A thought of added honour torn from Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>There is expectance here from both the sides,</ab>
<ab>What further you will do.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>We'll answer it;</ab>
<ab>The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>If I might in entreaties find success--</ab>
<ab>As seld I have the chance--I would desire</ab>
<ab>My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles</ab>
<ab>Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,</ab>
<ab>And signify this loving interview</ab>
<ab>To the expecters of our Trojan part;</ab>
<ab>Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;</ab>
<ab>I will go eat with thee and see your knights.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>The worthiest of them tell me name by name;</ab>
<ab>But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes</ab>
<ab>Shall find him by his large and portly size.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one</ab>
<ab>That would be rid of such an enemy;</ab>
<ab>But that's no welcome: understand more clear,</ab>
<ab>What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks</ab>
<ab>And formless ruin of oblivion;</ab>
<ab>But in this extant moment, faith and troth,</ab>
<ab>Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,</ab>
<ab>Bids thee, with most divine integrity,</ab>
<ab>From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab><stage>To TROILUS</stage>  My well-famed lord of Troy, no</ab>
<ab>less to you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:</ab>
<ab>You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Who must we answer?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>The noble Menelaus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!</ab>
<ab>Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;</ab>
<ab>Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:</ab>
<ab>She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>O, pardon; I offend.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft</ab>
<ab>Labouring for destiny make cruel way</ab>
<ab>Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,</ab>
<ab>As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,</ab>
<ab>Despising many forfeits and subduements,</ab>
<ab>When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,</ab>
<ab>Not letting it decline on the declined,</ab>
<ab>That I have said to some my standers by</ab>
<ab>'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'</ab>
<ab>And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,</ab>
<ab>When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,</ab>
<ab>Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;</ab>
<ab>But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,</ab>
<ab>I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,</ab>
<ab>And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;</ab>
<ab>But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,</ab>
<ab>Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;</ab>
<ab>And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>'Tis the old Nestor.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,</ab>
<ab>That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:</ab>
<ab>Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>I would my arms could match thee in contention,</ab>
<ab>As they contend with thee in courtesy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I would they could.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Ha!</ab>
<ab>By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.</ab>
<ab>Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>I wonder now how yonder city stands</ab>
<ab>When we have here her base and pillar by us.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.</ab>
<ab>Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,</ab>
<ab>Since first I saw yourself and Diomed</ab>
<ab>In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:</ab>
<ab>My prophecy is but half his journey yet;</ab>
<ab>For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,</ab>
<ab>Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,</ab>
<ab>Must kiss their own feet.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I must not believe you:</ab>
<ab>There they stand yet, and modestly I think,</ab>
<ab>The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost</ab>
<ab>A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,</ab>
<ab>And that old common arbitrator, Time,</ab>
<ab>Will one day end it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>So to him we leave it.</ab>
<ab>Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:</ab>
<ab>After the general, I beseech you next</ab>
<ab>To feast with me and see me at my tent.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!</ab>
<ab>Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;</ab>
<ab>I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,</ab>
<ab>And quoted joint by joint.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Is this Achilles?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I am Achilles.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Behold thy fill.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Nay, I have done already.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Thou art too brief: I will the second time,</ab>
<ab>As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;</ab>
<ab>But there's more in me than thou understand'st.</ab>
<ab>Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body</ab>
<ab>Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?</ab>
<ab>That I may give the local wound a name</ab>
<ab>And make distinct the very breach whereout</ab>
<ab>Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,</ab>
<ab>To answer such a question: stand again:</ab>
<ab>Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly</ab>
<ab>As to prenominate in nice conjecture</ab>
<ab>Where thou wilt hit me dead?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I tell thee, yea.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,</ab>
<ab>I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;</ab>
<ab>For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;</ab>
<ab>But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,</ab>
<ab>I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.</ab>
<ab>You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;</ab>
<ab>His insolence draws folly from my lips;</ab>
<ab>But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,</ab>
<ab>Or may I never--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>Do not chafe thee, cousin:</ab>
<ab>And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,</ab>
<ab>Till accident or purpose bring you to't:</ab>
<ab>You may have every day enough of Hector</ab>
<ab>If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,</ab>
<ab>Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I pray you, let us see you in the field:</ab>
<ab>We have had pelting wars, since you refused</ab>
<ab>The Grecians' cause.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Dost thou entreat me, Hector?</ab>
<ab>To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;</ab>
<ab>To-night all friends.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Thy hand upon that match.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;</ab>
<ab>There in the full convive we: afterwards,</ab>
<ab>As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall</ab>
<ab>Concur together, severally entreat him.</ab>
<ab>Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,</ab>
<ab>That this great soldier may his welcome know.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,</ab>
<ab>In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:</ab>
<ab>There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;</ab>
<ab>Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,</ab>
<ab>But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view</ab>
<ab>On the fair Cressid.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,</ab>
<ab>After we part from Agamemnon's tent,</ab>
<ab>To bring me thither?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>You shall command me, sir.</ab>
<ab>As gentle tell me, of what honour was</ab>
<ab>This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there</ab>
<ab>That wails her absence?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars</ab>
<ab>A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?</ab>
<ab>She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:</ab>
<ab>But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.</ab>

<stage>Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,</ab>
<ab>Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.</ab>
<ab>Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Here comes Thersites.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter THERSITES</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>How now, thou core of envy!</ab>
<ab>Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol</ab>
<ab>of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>From whence, fragment?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Who keeps the tent now?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:</ab>
<ab>thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases</ab>
<ab>of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,</ab>
<ab>loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold</ab>
<ab>palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing</ab>
<ab>lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,</ab>
<ab>limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the</ab>
<ab>rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take</ab>
<ab>again such preposterous discoveries!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest</ab>
<ab>thou to curse thus?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Do I curse thee?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson</ab>
<ab>indistinguishable cur, no.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle</ab>
<ab>immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet</ab>
<ab>flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's</ab>
<ab>purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered</ab>
<ab>with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>PATROCLUS</speaker>

<ab>Out, gall!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Finch-egg!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite</ab>
<ab>From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.</ab>
<ab>Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,</ab>
<ab>A token from her daughter, my fair love,</ab>
<ab>Both taxing me and gaging me to keep</ab>
<ab>An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:</ab>
<ab>Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;</ab>
<ab>My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.</ab>
<ab>Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:</ab>
<ab>This night in banqueting must all be spent.</ab>
<ab>Away, Patroclus!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>With too much blood and too little brain, these two</ab>
<ab>may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too</ab>
<ab>little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.</ab>
<ab>Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one</ab>
<ab>that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as</ab>
<ab>earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter</ab>
<ab>there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,</ab>
<ab>and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty</ab>
<ab>shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's</ab>
<ab>leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded</ab>
<ab>with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?</ab>
<ab>To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to</ab>
<ab>an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a</ab>
<ab>dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an</ab>
<ab>owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would</ab>
<ab>not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire</ab>
<ab>against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I</ab>
<ab>were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse</ab>
<ab>of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!</ab>
<ab>spirits and fires!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES,
NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>We go wrong, we go wrong.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>No, yonder 'tis;</ab>
<ab>There, where we see the lights.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I trouble you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.</ab>
<ab>Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MENELAUS</speaker>

<ab>Good night, my lord.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,</ab>
<ab>sweet sewer.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Good night and welcome, both at once, to those</ab>
<ab>That go or tarry.</ab>

<ab>Good night.</ab>

<stage>Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,</ab>
<ab>Keep Hector company an hour or two.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>I cannot, lord; I have important business,</ab>
<ab>The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Give me your hand.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab><stage>Aside to TROILUS</stage>  Follow his torch; he goes to</ab>
<ab>Calchas' tent:</ab>
<ab>I'll keep you company.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Sweet sir, you honour me.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>And so, good night.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit DIOMEDES; ULYSSES and TROILUS following</stage>

<ab>Come, come, enter my tent.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt ACHILLES, HECTOR, AJAX, and NESTOR</stage>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most</ab>
<ab>unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers</ab>
<ab>than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend</ab>
<ab>his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:</ab>
<ab>but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it</ab>
<ab>is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun</ab>
<ab>borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his</ab>
<ab>word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than</ab>
<ab>not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan</ab>
<ab>drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll</ab>
<ab>after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!</ab>

<sp><speaker>CALCHAS</speaker>

<ab><stage>Within</stage>  Who calls?</ab>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>How now, my charge!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Whispers</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Yea, so familiar!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>She will sing any man at first sight.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;</ab>
<ab>she's noted.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Will you remember?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Remember! yes.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Nay, but do, then;</ab>
<ab>And let your mind be coupled with your words.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>What should she remember?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>List.</ab>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Roguery!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Nay, then,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>I'll tell you what,--</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.</ab>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>What did you swear you would bestow on me?</ab>

<ab>No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.</ab>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Thy better must.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Hark, one word in your ear.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O plague and madness!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,</ab>
<ab>Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself</ab>
<ab>To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;</ab>
<ab>The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Behold, I pray you!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Nay, good my lord, go off:</ab>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>And so, good night.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Nay, but you part in anger.</ab>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.</ab>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>In faith, I do not: come hither once again.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?</ab>
<ab>You will break out.</ab>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Come, come.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:</ab>

<ab>A guard of patience: stay a little while.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and</ab>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.</ab>

<ab>O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!</ab>
<ab>Thy master now lies thinking in his bed</ab>
<ab>Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,</ab>
<ab>And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,</ab>
<ab>As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;</ab>
<ab>He that takes that doth take my heart withal.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>I had your heart before, this follows it.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>I did swear patience.</ab>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;</ab>
<ab>I'll give you something else.</ab>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>By all Diana's waiting-women yond,</ab>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,</ab>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,</ab>
<ab>It should be challenged.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CRESSIDA</speaker>

<ab>Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;</ab>

<ab>To make a recordation to my soul</ab>
<ab>Of every syllable that here was spoke.</ab>
<ab>But if I tell how these two did co-act,</ab>
<ab>Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?</ab>
<ab>Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,</ab>
<ab>An esperance so obstinately strong,</ab>
<ab>That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,</ab>
<ab>As if those organs had deceptious functions,</ab>
<ab>Created only to calumniate.</ab>
<ab>Was Cressid here?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>I cannot conjure, Trojan.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>She was not, sure.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Most sure she was.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Let it not be believed for womanhood!</ab>
<ab>Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage</ab>
<ab>To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,</ab>
<ab>For depravation, to square the general sex</ab>
<ab>By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Nothing at all, unless that this were she.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:</ab>
<ab>If beauty have a soul, this is not she;</ab>
<ab>If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,</ab>
<ab>If sanctimony be the gods' delight,</ab>
<ab>If there be rule in unity itself,</ab>
<ab>This is not she. O madness of discourse,</ab>
<ab>That cause sets up with and against itself!</ab>
<ab>Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt</ab>
<ab>Without perdition, and loss assume all reason</ab>
<ab>Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.</ab>
<ab>Within my soul there doth conduce a fight</ab>
<ab>Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate</ab>
<ab>Divides more wider than the sky and earth,</ab>
<ab>And yet the spacious breadth of this division</ab>
<ab>Admits no orifex for a point as subtle</ab>
<ab>As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.</ab>
<ab>Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;</ab>
<ab>Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:</ab>
<ab>Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;</ab>
<ab>The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;</ab>
<ab>And with another knot, five-finger-tied,</ab>
<ab>The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,</ab>
<ab>The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics</ab>
<ab>Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ULYSSES</speaker>

<ab>May worthy Troilus be half attach'd</ab>
<ab>With that which here his passion doth express?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well</ab>
<ab>In characters as red as Mars his heart</ab>
<ab>Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy</ab>
<ab>With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.</ab>
<ab>Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,</ab>
<ab>So much by weight hate I her Diomed:</ab>
<ab>That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;</ab>
<ab>Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,</ab>
<ab>My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout</ab>
<ab>Which shipmen do the hurricano call,</ab>
<ab>Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,</ab>
<ab>Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear</ab>
<ab>In his descent than shall my prompted sword</ab>
<ab>Falling on Diomed.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>He'll tickle it for his concupy.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!</ab>
<ab>Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,</ab>
<ab>And they'll seem glorious.</ab>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,</ab>
<ab>Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!</ab>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>CASSANDRA</speaker>

<ab>The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:</ab>
<ab>They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd</ab>

</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANDROMACHE</speaker>

<ab>O, be persuaded! do not count it holy</ab>
<ab>To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,</ab>
<ab>For we would give much, to use violent thefts,</ab>
<ab>And rob in the behalf of charity.</ab>

<sp><speaker>CASSANDRA</speaker>

<ab>It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;</ab>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Hold you still, I say;</ab>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,</ab>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.</ab>

<ab>Who should withhold me?</ab>
<ab>Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars</ab>
<ab>Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;</ab>
<ab>Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,</ab>
<ab>Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;</ab>

<ab>Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:</ab>
<ab>Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:</ab>
<ab>And when I have the bloody Hector found,</ab>
<ab>Empale him with your weapons round about;</ab>
<ab>In fellest manner execute your aims.</ab>
<ab>Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:</ab>
<ab>It is decreed Hector the great must die.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
<stage>Enter MENELAUS and PARIS, fighting:
then THERSITES</stage>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,</ab>
<ab>bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-</ab>
<ab>henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the</ab>
<ab>game: ware horns, ho!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt PARIS and MENELAUS</stage>
<stage>Enter MARGARELON</stage>

<sp><speaker>MARGARELON</speaker>

<ab>Turn, slave, and fight.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>What art thou?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MARGARELON</speaker>

<ab>A bastard son of Priam's.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>THERSITES</speaker>

<ab>I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard</ab>
<ab>begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard</ab>
<ab>in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will</ab>
<ab>not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?</ab>
<ab>Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the</ab>
<ab>son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:</ab>
<ab>farewell, bastard.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>MARGARELON</speaker>

<ab>The devil take thee, coward!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE VIII.  Another part of the plains.</head>
<stage>Enter HECTOR</stage>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>Most putrefied core, so fair without,</ab>
<ab>Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.</ab>
<ab>Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:</ab>
<ab>Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield
behind him</stage>
<stage>Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons</stage>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;</ab>
<ab>How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:</ab>
<ab>Even with the vail and darking of the sun,</ab>
<ab>To close the day up, Hector's life is done.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>HECTOR</speaker>

<ab>I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.</ab>
<stage>HECTOR falls</stage>
<ab>So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!</ab>
<ab>Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.</ab>
<ab>On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,</ab>
<ab>'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'</ab>
<stage>A retreat sounded</stage>
<ab>Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>MYRMIDONS</speaker>

<ab>The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACHILLES</speaker>

<ab>The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,</ab>
<ab>And, stickler-like, the armies separates.</ab>
<ab>My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,</ab>
<ab>Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.</ab>
<stage>Sheathes his sword</stage>
<ab>Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;</ab>
<ab>Along the field I will the Trojan trail.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE IX.  Another part of the plains.</head>
<stage>Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES,
and others, marching. Shouts within</stage>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>Hark! hark! what shout is that?</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>NESTOR</speaker>

<ab>Peace, drums!</ab>
<stage>Within</stage>
<ab>Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>DIOMEDES</speaker>

<ab>The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AJAX</speaker>

<ab>If it be so, yet bragless let it be;</ab>
<ab>Great Hector was a man as good as he.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AGAMEMNON</speaker>

<ab>March patiently along: let one be sent</ab>
<ab>To pray Achilles see us at our tent.</ab>
<ab>If in his death the gods have us befriended,</ab>
<ab>Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt, marching</stage>
</div>

<div><head>SCENE X.  Another part of the plains.</head>
<stage>Enter AENEAS and Trojans</stage>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:</ab>
<ab>Never go home; here starve we out the night.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Enter TROILUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Hector is slain.</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>ALL</speaker>

<ab>Hector! the gods forbid!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,</ab>
<ab>In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.</ab>
<ab>Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!</ab>
<ab>Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!</ab>
<ab>I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,</ab>
<ab>And linger not our sure destructions on!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>AENEAS</speaker>

<ab>My lord, you do discomfort all the host!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>You understand me not that tell me so:</ab>
<ab>I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,</ab>
<ab>But dare all imminence that gods and men</ab>
<ab>Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:</ab>
<ab>Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?</ab>
<ab>Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,</ab>
<ab>Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:</ab>
<ab>There is a word will Priam turn to stone;</ab>
<ab>Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,</ab>
<ab>Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,</ab>
<ab>Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:</ab>
<ab>Hector is dead; there is no more to say.</ab>
<ab>Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,</ab>
<ab>Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,</ab>
<ab>Let Titan rise as early as he dare,</ab>
<ab>I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,</ab>
<ab>No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:</ab>
<ab>I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,</ab>
<ab>That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.</ab>
<ab>Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:</ab>
<ab>Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans</stage>
<stage>As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other
side, PANDARUS</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>But hear you, hear you!</ab>
</sp>

<sp><speaker>TROILUS</speaker>

<ab>Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame</ab>
<ab>Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!</ab>
</sp>

<stage>Exit</stage>

<sp><speaker>PANDARUS</speaker>

<ab>A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!</ab>
<ab>world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!</ab>
<ab>O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set</ab>
<ab>a-work, and how ill requited! why should our</ab>
<ab>endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?</ab>
<ab>what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:</ab>
<ab>Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,</ab>
<ab>Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;</ab>
<ab>And being once subdued in armed tail,</ab>
<ab>Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.</ab>
<ab>Good traders in the flesh, set this in your</ab>
<ab>painted cloths.</ab>
<ab>As many as be here of pander's hall,</ab>
<ab>Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;</ab>
<ab>Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,</ab>
<ab>Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.</ab>
<ab>Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,</ab>
<ab>Some two months hence my will shall here be made:</ab>
<ab>It should be now, but that my fear is this,</ab>
<ab>Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:</ab>
<ab>Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,</ab>
<ab>And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.</ab>
