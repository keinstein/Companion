        <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
        <p>This history was written amid many interruptions. Sometimes long intervals elapsed before the pen could be resumed. I certainly aimed at accuracy. If there is any failure in this regard it is accidental. Similar disturbances during the important process of proof-reading caused errors, but they do not obscure the meaning. The book is larger than I expected, and hence some of the half-tones prepared for this volume will be reserved for its successor. Except where absolutely necessary for true portraiture, I have carefully refrained from wounding the feelings of any one.</p>
        <p>It may be said that I have dwelt too much on the pranks and frolics of students. My reason for detailing them is that they show, first, the social habits of the people generally, because the University is a microcosm of the State, and, second, they were largely caused by the defective system of discipline.</p>
        <p>I have endeavored to follow the careers in after-life of the honor men. It will be seen that a common belief that success at the University is no indication of success afterwards is altogether erroneous. I have endeavored also to note distinctions won by any who did not attain honors. In the Appendix, as far as our records show, the positions, however humble, held by our alumni in the Confederate Army, are given.</p>
        <p>It may be objected that the subjects of the speeches by graduates unnecessarily encumber the volume. My reasons for recording them are, 1st, that they show what the students were thinking about, and, 2d, that the students of the present and future may have a treasure-house of themes, which may aid them in solving the difficult question, “what must I write about?”</p>
        <p>I acknowledge with the deepest gratitude my obligations to Professor Collier Cobb, for aid in obtaining the faithful half-tones which grace the book, to Dr. J. G. deR. Hamilton, for the preparation of the very laborious and thorough index, and to Dr. C. L. Raper, for assistance in reading proofs of the first part of the volume.</p>
        <pb xml:id="pvi" n="vi"/>
        <p>One fact, not appearing on any record at Chapel Hill, has come to my knowledge since the volume was printed, that the Delta Psi Fraternity, with a large membership, was in the University from 1854 until some time during the war. I will be glad if all who may notice such derelictions will notify me of the same. I promise to give the proper corrections in the second volume.</p>
        <p>I further express my thanks to the Honorable Board of Trustees for giving me free access to the University archives. I have explored them industriously, and used them with pains-taking endeavor to be accurate.</p>

          <head>THE CHARTER AND ORGANIZATION.</head>
          <p>It might be claimed that the Centennial year of American Independence was likewise the Centennial year of the University of North Carolina, although the charter was not granted until 1789.</p>
          <p>In December, 1776, a Convention, then called Congress, of enlightened men met at Halifax to form a Constitution for the new free State of North Carolina, under whose protection the people could maintain the independence they had declared a few months before.</p>
          <p>Without an army or navy, they had entered on a war for existence with a nation powerful, populous and wealthy, having the tradition of invincibility, which had, under Marlborough, within the century, broken the power of the Great Louis of France—had, with heavy hand, crushed the fortunes of the Pretender at Culloden—had sent Wolfe to storm the Heights of Quebec; had swept the seas with her fleets. The Revolution, if it failed, was Rebellion. The penalty of defeat was the doom of traitors. The State had barely two hundred thousand inhabitants, widely scattered, and badly armed, and divided in sentiment. But, notwithstanding these odds, this Congress, with wisdom unparalleled and faith approaching sublimity, provided for the interest of unborn children. They knew that those children would not be capable of freedom without education. They knew that there could be no education without teachers. They knew that teachers could not be procured without colleges. They knew that their leaders in the pulpit and in civil offices had received their education in distant States and even in the mother country across the ocean. They resolved that their youth, seeking intellectual advancement, should not be temporarily expatriated in order to obtain it. They made the requirement of the University a part of the fundamental law. On the 18th of December, 1776, in the Constitution of<pb xml:id="p2" n="2"/>
the new State, then first adopted, are found these golden words, written amid storms and thunderings, to be made good when the sun shone on a free and united people: “All useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.”</p>
          <p>Tradition has it that this provision in the Constitution was due to the Scotch-Irish of Mecklenburg. Smarting under resentment caused by the disapproval by the Crown of the charter of Queen's College, its friends procured from the people of the county a positive instruction to their delegates to the Halifax Congress of 1776 to provide for a State college. Among these delegates was Waightstill Avery, a graduate of Princeton, likewise a member of the committee which reported the Constitution, and the tradition which credits him with being the draftsman of the University and public school clause is certainly plausible.</p>
          <p>That our forefathers thought that the University and the public school system were necessarily part of one organism is proved by their connection in the Constitution. The section in which the General Assembly is commanded to provide the University is as follows: Section 41—“A school, or schools, shall be established by the legislature for the convenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the masters, paid by the public, as may enable them to instruct at low prices: and all useful learning shall be duly encouraged and promoted in one or more universities.” It was clear to the statesmen of a hundred years ago, and it ought not to require argument to prove it, that money spent for schools without providing teachers is mere waste and folly. And certainly our forefathers who, with their hearts sore from the attempted domination of the Church of England in colonial times, inserted in the Constitution that, “no clergyman, or preacher of the gospel, of any denomination, shall be capable of being a member, either of the Senate, House of Commons, or Council of State, while he continues in the exercise of the pastoral function,” together with other provisions, completely serving the connection between the Church and the State, never designed that state schools should look to religious colleges exclusively for their teachers, nor did they wish to be dependent on other States.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p3" n="3"/>
          <p>During the War of the Revolution the mandate of the Constitution lay dormant. <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Inter arma silent leges</foreign>.</hi>When Caswell and Lillington were beating McDonald at Moore's Creek Bridge, and Campbell, Shelby, Cleveland, Sevier, Williams and McDowell were capturing Ferguson's forces at King's Mountain, and Cornwallis and Greene were wrestling for the victory at Guilford, and Fanning was carrying as prisoner from Hillsboro the Governor of our State, and the momentous question whether our ancestors were patriots or traitors, was still undecided, there was no time for erecting universities. And after the war, industry must have time for restoring plenty to wasted lands and statesmanship to form a settled government in the place of a nerveless confederacy. In the month of November, 1789, our State, after a hesitation of a year, entered the American Union. In the month of December, as if forming part of a comprehensive plan, the charter of the University, under the powerful advocacy of Davie, was granted by the General Assembly. The Trustees under the charter comprised great men of the State, good men of the State, trusted leaders of the people.</p>
          <p>The first named, and the chairman, was Governor Samuel Johnston, who, in legislative, executive and judicial stations, in war and peace, left the impress of his wise conservatism on the State. There were James Iredell, one of the earliest Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, and Alfred Moore, his successor in this high office. There were the first Federal District Judge, Colonel John Stokes, and John Sitgreaves, his successor.</p>
          <p>There were the three signers of the Constitution of the United States: Hugh Williamson, the historian William Blount, afterwards Senator of the United States from Tennessee, and Richard Dobbs Spaight, who left Trinity College, Dublin, when scarcely of age, to fight for the independence of his native State. He served as delegate to the Congress of the Confederation, and of the United States, and as Governor of North Carolina. Of others destined to be Governors, there were Samuel Ashe, then Judge, Benjamin Williams, and the first benefactor of the University, Benjamin Smith, and William Richardson Davie, its father. There were military men,<pb xml:id="p4" n="4"/>
who had been conspicuous fighters in the Revolution: General Joseph Graham, scarred with wounds in the defence of Charlotte under Davie, the father of the revered statesman, William A. Graham, whose last public appearance was in behalf of the University; General Thomas Person, whose hatred of injustice began with the disastrous struggles of the Regulation, William Lenoir, Joseph McDowell, the elder, and Joseph Dixon (or Dickson), who aided in thwarting the plans of Cornwallis by the capture of Ferguson at King's Mountain; Henry William Harrington, an active militia general in service on our southern borders.</p>
          <p>Of the State judiciary we find three judges under the court law of 1777—Samuel Spencer, John Williams, and Samuel Ashe, already mentioned, whose name is worthily represented by his descendants, Thomas Samuel Ashe, late of Anson, and Samuel A. Ashe, of Raleigh; and of others distinguished in the history of the State—Archibald McLaine and Willie Jones, bold and active patriots, Stephen Cabarrus, long Speaker of the House of Commons, and John Haywood, the popular State Treasurer. There were the first two Senators of the United States—Samuel Johnston and Benjamin Hawkins, and of those destined to be members of the lower House of Congress were Charles Johnson, then Speaker of the State Senate, who had fought for the Stuarts at Culloden, James Holland of Guilford, Alexander Mebane of Orange, Joseph Winston of Surry, and William Barry Grove of Cumberland. We find in the list John Hay, the eminent lawyer of Fayetteville, who gave his name to Haymount; James Hogg, an enlightened merchant of Fayetteville and of Hillsboro; Adlai Osborne, the highly esteemed Clerk of Rowan Superior Court; the eminent teacher and divine, Rev. Samuel E. McCorkle, D.D.; and prominent and useful members of the State legislature, Frederick Hargett, Senator of Jones, Robert W. Snead, Senator of Onslow, Joel Lane, Senator from Wake, owner of the land bought for the site of the city of Raleigh, John Macon, Senator of Warren, brother of the more eminent Nathaniel Macon, John Hamilton, commoner of Guilford, William Porter, commoner of Rutherford, and Robert Dickson of Duplin.</p>
          <p>The moving spirit of this distinguished band was William<pb xml:id="p5" n="5"/>
Richardson Davie. He was no common man. He had been a gallant cavalry officer in the Revolution. He had been a strong staff on which Greene had leaned. He had been conspicuous in civil pursuits; an able lawyer, an orator of wide influence. With Washington and Madison, and other great men, he had assisted in evolving the grandest government of all ages, the American Union, out of an ill-governed and disintegrated confederacy. He was beyond his times in the advocacy of a broad, generous education. His portrait has been drawn by a masterly hand, Judge Archibald Murphey, one of the most progressive and scholarly men our State has known. In his speech before the two Societies at Chapel Hill in 1827 he says: “Davie was a tall, elegant man in his person, graceful and commanding in his manners. His voice was mellow, and adapted to the expression of every passion; his mind comprehensive yet slow in its operations, when compared with his great rival (Moore); his style was magnificent and flowing; he had a greatness of manner in public speaking which suited his style, and gave to his speeches an imposing effect. He was a laborious student, arranged his discourses with care, and where the subject merited his genius, poured forth a torrent of eloquence that astonished and enraptured his audience.”</p>
          <p>He had, in the Constitutional Convention of 1787, at a critical moment, caused the vote of North Carolina, then one of the large States, to be cast for a compromise, the equality of States in the Senate, without which union would have been impossible. In the State Conventions of 1788 and 1789 he had advocated the adoption of the new Constitution with equal ability. It was his foresight and wisdom which provided the University, by whose means North Carolina could keep pace in culture and influence with her sisters. He drew for the University the Plan of Studies pursued for many years, and maintained its interest by his purse, his eloquence, his counsels, and constant attention to its exercises. The Dialectic Society is the fortunate owner of an excellent portrait of this great man—the picture of a man of military bearing, strikingly handsome, a gentleman, a scholar and a statesman.</p>
          <p>Such were the guardians into whose care the General Assembly committed the institution provided for the youth of North<pb xml:id="p6" n="6"/>
Carolina. Six of them—McLean, Person, Ashe, Jones, Lane and Mebane—were carrying into effect the mandate of the Constitution for which as members of the Halifax Congress of 1776 they had voted. Twenty-three, viz: Hargett, Smith, McDowell, Hay, Grove, Cabarrus, Samuel Johnston, Charles Johnson, Robert Dickson, Hamilton, Person, Sneed, Mebane, Stokes, Holland, Winston, Blount, Williamson, Hawkins, Lane, Lenoir, Davie, and Porter, were members of the Convention of 1789, and of them only Dickson, Hamilton, Person, and Lenoir voted against the ratification of the Constitution of the United States.</p>
          <p>The charter, granted by the General Assembly, was ratified December 11, 1789. The preamble, in wise and weighty words, asserts that, “in all well regulated governments it is the indispensable duty of every legislature to consult the happiness of a rising generation, and endeavor to fit them for an honorable discharge of the social duties of life by paying the strictest attention to their education, and that, a University, supported by permanent funds and well endowed, would have the most direct tendency to answer the above purpose.”</p>
          <p>Among the provisions of the charter, in addition to the usual powers of corporations, are the following:</p>
          <p>The Trustees were a self-perpetuating body, having cooptative powers; being authorized to fill vacancies occurring by death, refusing to act, resignation or removal from the State.</p>
          <p>The principle of having the Trustees distributed in the judicial districts was to be retained in all elections.</p>
          <p>The first meeting of the Trustees was directed to be on the third Monday of the next General Assembly at Fayetteville, at which time were to be elected a President of the Board, and a Secretary. At all subsequent, regular, or annual meetings, the members present, with the President and Treasurer, or a majority without either of these officers, were to be a quorum.</p>
          <p>Special meetings could be called by the President and two Trustees, notice being given to every Trustee, and advertisement to be made in the <hi rend="italics">State Gazette.</hi>These meetings were prohibited from appropriating money, and from electing the President and Professors of the University. They, however, could fill a vacancy until the next annual meeting.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p7" n="7"/>
          <p>The meeting, at which the site of the University should be fixed upon, was to be advertized in the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi>for at least six months and special notice given to each Trustee.</p>
          <p>The Treasurer was to give bond, payable to the Governor, in the sum of £5,000 ($10,000), and to hold office for two years. If he should prove delinquent recovery was to be had as in the case of Sheriffs.</p>
          <p>The Treasurer was directed to publish annually in the <hi rend="italics">State Gazette</hi>a list of moneys and other donations under penalty of £100 ($200) at the suit of the Attorney-General, the penalties to belong to the University. The Treasurer was ordered to pay annually to the Treasurer of the State all moneys received by him, on which the State was to pay six per cent interest, the principal to be a permanent fund. (This was repealed four years afterwards.)</p>
          <p>The site of the University was not to be within five miles of the seat of government, or any of the places of holding the courts of law or equity.</p>
          <p>The Trustees could appoint a President of the University, and the professors and tutors, whom “they may remove for misbehavior, inability, or neglect of duty.” They could “make all such laws and regulations for the government of the University and preservation of order and good morals therein as are usually made in such seminaries, and as to them may appear necessary: <hi rend="italics">Provided,</hi>the same are not contrary to the inalienable liberty of a citizen or to the laws of the State.”</p>
          <p>The power of conferring degrees was given to the Faculty of the University, that is to say, the President and Professors, but the Trustees must concur.</p>
          <p>Any subscriber of £10 ($20), payable in five equal annual installments, was entitled to have one student educated free of tuition.</p>
          <p>The public hall, and the library and rooms of the college shall be called by the names of one or another of the six largest subscribers within four years. “And a book shall be kept in the library in which shall be entered the names and places of residence of every benefactor to this seminary, in order that posterity may be informed to whom they are indebted for the<pb xml:id="p8" n="8"/>
measure of learning and good morals that may prevail in the State.”</p>
          <p>The foregoing summary shows some provisions which appear strange in our eyes. For example, that any number of Trustees, no matter how small, should be a quorum, if only the President of the Board and the Treasurer should be present, neither of whom was necessarily a member. Then, again, the prohibition of locating the University within five miles of the seat of government or of any court town is contrary to our experience. It was doubtless on account of the rowdyism and drunkenness during court week, then so prevalent, now happily passing away. The provision that only the State should be the custodian of the donations of money and pay interest on the same, the University being prohibited from using the principal, seems inconsistent with the imperative duty of erecting buildings. Note also that only the President and Professors, excluding tutors, constitute the faculty, and that the Trustees have no power of conferring degrees, but can only confirm or reject the nominations of the faculty. The provision that a student should have his tuition for four years on a payment of $20 by a subscriber seems reckless, unless there was a general idea prevalent that tuition should be nearly free. The appeal to the vanity of the wealthy is interesting, firstly, because it shows that the projectors of the University, even in those dark days, had grand ideas as to the future, when without a dollar in sight they estimated no less than six buildings, to be essential, and, secondly, because the promise of honoring benefactors was made irrespective of the amounts to be given.</p>
          <p>The fear that the Trustees might, in making their by-laws, be more severe on the students than would be consistent with the “Rights of Man,” for which so much blood had been spilt, is shown in the protective clause that those laws should not be “contrary to the inalienable liberty of a citizen.” It will be seen in the sequel that the young men interpreted this in the broadest latitude as negativing all restraint. The construction of this charter provision by the Trustees, that the professors and tutors were to be like police officers in carrying out the discipline of the institution, led to serious evils for very many years.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p9" n="9"/>
          <p>The locating of the Trustees in the several judicial districts in those days of bad roads, although possibly propitiating favor, was fatal to wise management. The expedient of giving wide powers to an executive committee of seven, which works so wisely now, had not then been thought of.</p>
          <p>The power of the Trustees of filling vacancies in their body seemed harmless, if not wise. It was destined, however, to place the institution under the suspicion of being aristocratic, a suspicion fatal to its popularity in the days when there existed among the people a real fear of the introduction of English class distinctions and of a government monarchical in nature, though not in name. The provision was changed eventually, as will be seen.</p>
          <p>On the whole, it seems probable that some of these outre provisions were inserted on the motion of members hostile to the movement, or by its friends for the purpose of placating them. Like the Fundamental Constitutions of the Lords Proprietors, the charter of the University is another evidence that all good government is the product of experience and growth, and can not be planned beforehand by the wit of man.</p>
          <p>There was no appropriation of money made for erection of buildings or other expenditure for the new institution. An act was, however, passed which conferred on it certain claims, which the officers of the State had been unable to collect. These were arrearages due from sheriffs and other officers prior to January 1, 1783, none of them less than six years old and some far more. The proceeds of sales of confiscated lands were excepted from the gift, probably because the legislature deemed them easily collectible. A further exception was made of all the arrearages due by Robert Lanier, treasurer of the judicial district of Salisbury, and also those from the sheriffs of that district, but if they should not settle their dues in two years, the University was authorized to have all the uncollected residue.</p>
          <p>The delinquents, sixty-eight in number, whose accounts were turned over by the act, were officers of the State or counties, some distinguished and of high character—such as General Horatio Gates, Governor Burke, Colonel Benjamin Cleveland.<pb xml:id="p10" n="10"/>
General Hogan, Marquis de Bretigny. Evidently many were for agencies during the war, in which vouchers were lost or captured by the enemy, or the settlements of the agencies destroyed. Colonel Waightstill Avery, for example, was included in the list, but he promptly proved that there was a mistake, and his name was at once struck off. The following list shows more clearly the employments of those indebted to the State according to the Comptroller's report, which debts were transferred to the University: namely, Clerks, Sheriffs, purchasers of confiscated property, Judges (fees for lawyer's licenses), entry-takers, agents, purchasers of lots in Raleigh, commissionaries (commissaries?), purchasers of western lands, buyer of eleven head of cattle, also of four head of cattle, buyer of one horse, hirer of McKnight's negroes (McKnight was a Tory), debtors for specie certificates, also for “old dollar money,” also for officer's certificates, entries of western lands, and certificates of the Auditors of the Upper Board of Salisbury.</p>
          <p>At the same session was granted a right, shadowy, uncertain, well nigh <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">in nubibus</foreign>,</hi>but which in the course of time by skillful management brought considerable money into the treasury. This grant was such property as had escheated, or should thereafter escheat, to the State. This by the energy and good management of the Trustees, after a long period, was the source of the endowment of the University, lost in the Civil War. Many denizens of foreign birth left no heirs, citizens of North Carolina, and under the law as it stood until 1831, their lands escheated to the State; and in a like manner obscure soldiers of the Continental Line, to whom land warrants were granted for their services in the war, died leaving no heirs to inherit their claims. Of course the revenue from this source naturally diminished as the years rolled away from the Revolution, and it was still further diminished by acts of the Legislature giving the lands to a remoter heir, being a citizen, when the next heir is an alien, and giving the widow all the estate if her husband should die without an heir. At this day the chances of an escheat are worth but little, as an alien stands on the same footing with a citizen in regard to the possession of real estate.</p>
          <p>It was not from parsimony but hard necessity that the long services of our patriot soldiers, in hunger, and thirst, and cold,<pb xml:id="p11" n="11"/>
and nakedness, were paid for in a paper currency, like that of which the conquered Confederates have had such bitter experience. To this meagre dole was added for faithful service warrants for land to be located in a country of great fertility, but the homes of bears, panthers, and Indians, the western region of Tennessee, then a part of the domain of North Carolina. To a private was given 640 acres, to a lieutenant 2,560, to a Captain 3,840, to a Major 4,800, to a Colonel, or Lieutenant-Colonel Commanding, 7,200, to a Brigadier-General 12,000 acres. To the great General Greene, who had by his genius retrieved the fortunes of the war after Gates' disastrous failure, they gave 25,000 acres.</p>
          <p>The gift of the unclaimed land warrants was for years to the University like the cool waters near the parched lips of Tantalus. North Carolina, in 1789, ceded all its territory of Tennessee to the United States. The new State, after its admission into the Union in 1796, claimed all the rights of sovereignty, and refused to give effect to the grants made by North Carolina.</p>
          <p>The State of North Carolina would never have secured an acre of these lands. No argument but that they were to be used for education, had any weight with the legislators of Tennessee. The Trustees sent to plead their cause one of their most enlightened members and most skilled in the arts of managing men, Judge Archibald Murphey. Even he, with all his eloquence and address, was forced to a hard compromise. Two-thirds of the warrants were given to the College of East Tennessee and College of Cumberland, and one-third to the University of North Carolina. It was not until 1835, after suffering untold privations, staggering under a debt of nearly $40,000 to the banks, that funds were gathered from this source and from the donations of Smith, Gerrard and others, to lift its head above the waters. A detailed narrative of the negotiations will be given hereafter.</p>
          <p>It is pleasant to note that by the providence of our ancestors the enemies of our country's freedom contributed, albeit unwillingly, to the <choice><sic>enlightment</sic><corr>enlightenment</corr></choice>of our people. But it is of pathetic interest to know that the ignorant soldiers of America, who,<pb xml:id="p12" n="12"/>
after countless sufferings filled uncoffined graves, were not only gaining liberty for their country but, unintentional benefactors, were building a great institution of learning. They did glorious work, those “unnamed demigods of history,” as Kossuth called them, blindly suffering martyrdom for a cause they dimly understood, but that cause triumphant and leading to never ending blessings of free institutions and liberal education.</p>
          <p>The first meeting of the Trustees was on the 18th of December, 1789, seven days after the ratification of the charter. To copy from the record those present were:</p>
          <p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>The Hon. Charles Johnson, of Bertie, Chairman.</item>
              <item>Hon. S. Cabarrus of Chowan.</item>
              <item>James Holland of Rutherford.</item>

              <item>Robert Dixon of Duplin.</item>
              <item>Alexander Mebane of Orange.</item>
              <item>John Hamilton of Guilford.</item>
              <item>William R. Davie of Halifax.</item>
              <item>Frederick Hargett of Jones.</item>
              <item>James Hogg of Orange.</item>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>It will be noticed that the only persons dignified with the affix “Hon.,” are Johnson and Cabarrus. That was because they were Speakers of the Senate and of the House respectively, and represented those august bodies. The title was then restricted as a rule to the actual incumbents of these and such high officers as President, Governor and Judge. It is now rapidly descending to the same dead level as that occupied by Mister, which itself has experienced the like degradation. Johnson, the grandfather of the late eminent Dr. Charles E. Johnson, of Raleigh, was a relation of Governor Gabriel and of Governor Samuel Johnston, but omitted “t” from his name because, having, when barely of age, fought for Charles Edward, he wished to conceal his identity.</p>
          <p>It was thought for years, until the Supreme Court settled the question by deciding to the contrary, that the University is a private corporation. That the earliest Trustees thought differently is proved by the fact that they did not formally accept the charter, but organized at once as public officers.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Davie and Hogg were requested to prepare blanks for subscriptions, one as specially directed by the Act of Assembly, the other on the principle of a mere donation.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p13" n="13"/>
          <p>Mr. Davie made the agreeable announcement that Colonel Benjamin Smith offered a gift to the University of 20,000 acres of land warrants. The Trustees recorded their thanks for “the liberal and generous donation.”</p>
          <p>Another early friend of the institution should be held in grateful remembrance. Governor Alexander Martin showed his interest by frequent attendance on the meetings of the Board, by occasional timely gifts and by advocating in his message to the General Assemblies its establishment and maintenance. In the fall of 1790 he wrote, “This institution already stamped with importance, having the great cause of humanity for its object, might do honor to this and the neighboring States, had it an adequate support, where our youth might be instructed in true religion, sound policy and science, and men of ability drawn forth to fill the different departments of government with reputation, or be formed for useful and ornamental members of society in private or professional life.” He then recommends a loan for erecting buildings to “give it a more essential than a paper being.”</p>
          <p>The second meeting of the Board of Trustees, the first prescribed by the charter, was held likewise in Fayetteville on the 25th of November, 1790. General William Lenoir, of Wilkes County, President of the Senate, a hero of King's Mountain, on the nomination of the Speaker of the House, Stephen Cabarrus, was made President of the Board. He, first of a long line of eminent men who held this office, was the last survivor of the original Trustees, dying at the age of 88, just fifty years after the enactment of the charter. In such high estimation was he held that an eastern county and a western town were named in his honor.</p>
          <p>Changes had occurred in the Board of Trustees. The old heroes were dropping off. The venerable Robert Dixon gave way to James Kenan, grandfather of our worthy Trustee and President of our Alumni Association; and battle-scarred Judge Winston to Alexander Martin, who, like our Vance, had been Governor in times of war, and, after a long interval, in times of peace occupied the executive chair. James Hogg proceeded to the welcome duty of presenting to the Board patents for the 20,000 acres of land, donated at the preceding meeting by<pb xml:id="p14" n="14"/>
General Smith. On the resignation, by Colonel Lenoir, of the chairmanship, Governor Alexander Martin was chosen as his successor. On balloting for the office of Treasurer, John Craven, the State Comptroller, an old bachelor of Halifax County, was unanimously elected. His bondsmen were Colonel John Macon, of Warren, and General Thomas Person, of Granville. James Taylor, a Commoner from Rockingham County, was with like unanimity chosen Secretary. It was agreed that the place of the next meeting should be selected by ballot. Hillsborough, Salem, Williamsburg (now Williamsboro), Goshen (in Granville), Rockingham and Wake Court House were placed in nomination. The vote of the majority was for Hillsboro. It is pleasant to note the care taken to satisfy all sections that the location of the University should be fairly made. It was resolved that at the next meeting on the third Monday of July, 1791, the special business should be the selection of the site. Each Trustee was notified of this and a copy of the resolutions was ordered to be published in the <hi rend="italics">State Gazette</hi>for six months. [In those days the General Assembly designated some newspaper as the official organ of the State. At this date it was the <hi rend="italics">North Carolina Journal</hi>at Halifax, published by Hodge &amp; Willis. Hodge was the uncle of the prominent Raleigh citizen, William Boylan, and brought him from New Jersey to assist him in his publications.]</p>
          <p>The Board of Trustees ordered that the efforts to obtain donations should be continued. As was hoped by its friends, the University was a more successful collector than the State. On December 6, 1790, the empty treasury was gladdened by the receipt of $2,706.41, paid by John Harvey, Clerk of Perquimans Court, recovered from a delinquent “Commissioner of Specifics.” This was by the Trustees, as then required by the charter, invested in United States stock created by the financial ability of Alexander Hamilton.</p>
          <p>At the July, 1791, meeting Robert Burton, of Granville, father of Judge Robert H. Burton, of Lincolnton, and great grandfather of the distinguished North Carolina General, Robert F. Hoke, and great-great-grandfather of the still more distinguished (in athletic circles) Captain of our football team which<pb xml:id="p15" n="15"/>
took the scalp of the University of Virginia team at Atlanta—Dr. Mike Hoke—was chosen Secretary in the place of James Taylor, resigned. Probably on account of the meagre amount of money on hand and in sight, no steps were taken to select the site, but vigorous action was had for the collection of the arrearages and escheats granted by the Assembly. Each Trustee was authorized to act as agent of the Board in the matter of escheats, and attorneys, vested with full powers of collection and compromise in regard to them and the arrearages, were appointed in each judicial district. As evidently the lawyers who combined ability, integrity, activity, and friendship to the University, were chosen, I give their names. They were Edmund Blount for the Edenton District, David Perkins for that of New Bern, William H. Hill for that of Wilmington, Thomas F. Davis for that of Fayetteville, Adlai Osborne for that of Salisbury, Waightstill Avery for that of Morgan, William Watters for that of Hillsborough, and John Whitaker for that of Halifax. The sensibilities of the modern lawyer will be shocked by the statement that they were required to give bond with good security for performance of duty.</p>
          <p>The Trustees made a manly implied confession of ignorance on the subject of the great task resting on their shoulders and displayed a proper carefulness to perform their duties intelligently, when they appointed Rev. Dr. McCorckle, the teacher, Benjamin Hawkins, the Federal Senator, and Dr. Hugh Williamson, an ex-professor of the University of Pennsylvania, then a member of Congress from the Edenton District, to procure for the use of the Board information respecting the laws, regulations, and buildings of the universities and colleges in the United States, together with an account of their resources and expenditures, and an estimate of the cost of the necessary buildings for our University. The confidence of the Board in James Hogg, Alfred Moore, and John Haywood, was shown by taking away from a large committee, previously appointed, the power of selecting a device for a seal of the corporation, and conferring it on them. They chose the face of Apollo, the God of Eloquence, and his emblem, the rising sun, as expressive of the dawn of higher education in our State.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p16" n="16"/>
          <p>At New Bern, in December, 1791, William Lenoir, in behalf of a committee, consisting of himself, Stephen Cabarrus, Benjamin Williams, John Haywood (the Treasurer), Joseph McDowell, of Pleasant Garden, and Samuel Johnston, made a woeful report on the finances, present and prospective, of the institution. The total cash was $301.24, received from arrearages. There was hope that more would be realized, which the committee estimated at $300. The University owned also a certificate of United States loan for $2,706.41, of which under the charter only the interest, six per cent, could be used. The subscription papers sent out had not been returned and the amount to be expected from them was not ascertainable.</p>
          <p>The committee pathetically state that they are “pained when they reflect how extremely illy the resources of the Trustees are proportioned to their necessities.” As to the claims due the State from Colonial days, no evidence is found in regard to them “other than a report or list of balances made out by a committee of the Assembly in 1773.”</p>
          <p>As to the arrearages voted to the University, which arose under the State government, it is stated that for many years after the Revolution the revenue business was under a Treasurer in each district, some of whom knew not how to keep accounts; that the Treasurer of New Bern had fled the State, carrying his books with him; the Treasurer of Salisbury District had died, leaving his account in such bad shape that the executor, William Lanier, had induced the General Assembly to close them by settlement. When Treasurers duly settled their accounts, their books and papers were sent to the agent of the State in Philadelphia to be used in supporting the claims of North Carolina against the United States for troops and supplies furnished during the Revolution, and the only evidences of debts accessible are the statements of the Comptroller as to balances appearing on his books.</p>
          <p>Of these there had been delivered to the Trustees claims against seventy-three persons. The nominal amount was in round numbers $11,410, ranging all the way from $2,660 against one person to $3 against another. One claim was for $4.10, the equivalent of $410 “old Dollar money.” Among them was an account against Governor Burke for about $100,<pb xml:id="p17" n="17"/>
another for “£1,056 Dollar Money,” scaled down to $35.40; another against no less a man than Colonel Benjamin Cleveland for $368.00. Doubtless many of these claims had been settled and the vouchers lost during the war.</p>
          <p>As has been stated there had been collected the sum of $2,706.41 from the arrearages due by delinquent collecting officers. By activity and skill the attorneys of the University succeeded eventually in wresting from this source the scarcely hoped for total of $7,362, of which the interest only could be used.</p>
          <p>Steps were again taken to raise money by subscription. On November 5, 1792, papers were circulated inviting donations payable one year after the selection of the site. Most of the promises by citizens of Orange County were made on condition that the location should be therein.</p>
          <p>On December 23, 1791, a committee, whose names are not given in the journal, reported a memorial to the General Assembly asking for a loan of $10,000 in order to erect the buildings necessary for opening the institution. The measure was placed under the charge of Davie, who was a member of the House for the Borough of Halifax. His speech in support of it is thus described by Judge Murphey in his address of 1826: “I was present in the House of Commons when Davie addressed that body upon the bill granting a loan of money to the Trustees for erecting the buildings of the University, and although more than thirty years have since elapsed. I have the most vivid recollection of the greatness of his manner and the powers of his eloquence on that occasion.” The appeal was successful. The loan was afterwards converted into a gift—the only appropriation ever made from the State Treasury until the annuity of $5,000, granted in 1881, with the exception of $7,000 for the suffering officers soon after the Civil War.</p>
          <p>This loan was not secured without a struggle. There were many members who believed that the people's money should not be expended for any purpose other than the prevention and punishment of crime, settling disputes among citizens and other similar governmental functions. The vote was 57 to 53 in the House of Commons and 28 to 21 in the Senate. Among those<pb xml:id="p18" n="18"/>
who supported the measure in the House were Messrs. Richard Blackledge and John Lanier of Beaufort, David Stone of Bertie, Joseph McDowell, Jr., of Burke, David Vance of Burke, Thomas Granberry of Gates, Wm. E. Lord and Benjamin Smith of Brunswick, Richard Benbury of Chowan, Willis Alston of Halifax, Ebenezer Slade of Martin, Timothy Bloodworth of New Hanover. The affirmative Senators were Joseph McDowell (Quaker Meadows) of Burke, Gautier of Bladen, F. Campbell of Cumberland, Carney of Craven, Charlton of Bertie, Dauge of Camden, Kennedy of Beaufort, Humphries of Currituck, Reddick of Gates, Eborn of Hyde, Gray of Johnston, Hargett of Jones, Dixon of Lincoln, Mayo of Martin, Person of Granville, Sneed of Onslow, Benford of Northampton, Skinner of Perquimans, Moye of Pitt, Williams of Richmond, Willis of Robeson, Singleton of Rutherford, Lane of Wake, Macon of Warren, Swann of Pasquotank, Dickens of Caswell, Johnson of (county doubtful).</p>
          <p>Opposed to the bill were Wade of Anson, Bell of Carteret, J. Stewart of Chatham, Tyson of Moore, Graham of Mecklenburg, J. A. Campbell of New Hanover, Turner of Montgomery, Quails of Halifax, Wynns of Hertford, Hill of Franklin, Winston of Stokes, Clinton of Sampson, Berger of Rowan, Griffin of Nash, Galloway of Rockingham, Edwards of Surry, Hodge of Orange, Wood of Randolph, Gillespie of Guilford, Caldwell of Iredell, Phillips of Edgecombe. A very few did not vote, among them, Wm. Lenoir, it not being the custom for the Speaker to vote except in case of a tie. On inspecting the list it will be found that three of the affirmative Senators. Stone, Hargett and Lane, were on the Committee of Location, Reddick was for eleven years Speaker of the Senate, Dixon and Lane were Trustees. Of the opponents Hodge and Stewart would have probably voted differently if they had foreseen the location in Orange, near the Chatham line. It is surprising to see New Hanover, noted for its liberality, in this column. Doubtless Campbell misrepresented his constituents. It is equally surprising to see General Thomas Wynns and General Joseph Graham opposing higher education. The mistake of Graham is amply atoned for by the constant and active friendship to the University of his broad-minded sons and grandsons.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p19" n="19"/>
          <p>It was not until January, 1792, that further steps were taken to select the University site. On that day a resolution was passed appointing Judge John Williams, General Thomas Person, General Alexander Mebane, Colonel John Macon, Colonel Benjamin Williams, Colonel Joel Lane, and General Alfred Moore, or any three of them, to examine the “most proper and eligible situations whereon to fix the University, in the counties of Wake, Franklin, Warren, Orange, Granville, Chatham and Johnston,” and ascertain the terms on which such situation can be bought and report to the next meeting. Probably the committee failed to act, as no report was made by them. Action under the resolutions was not had, by common consent a different method being deemed advisable.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE LOCATION.</head>
          <p>A second resolution was passed that the Board meet at Hills-borough on the 1st of August, 1792, in order to determine the location, and that due notice be given to each Trustee.</p>
          <p>At the time and place appointed the attendance of members proved the interest taken in the question. There were present 25 Trustees out of 40. The largest number in these days of easy railroading is 39 out of 80, in 1885, when six professors were elected. Such patriotic sacrifice of comfort in the heated dog-days deserves to be recorded. Those who answered to the roll-call were as follows:</p>
          <p>Alexander Martin, Governor, of Guilford; Hugh Williamson, the historian, of Chowan; Benjamin Williams, afterwards Governor, of Moore; John Sitgreaves, Judge United States District Court, of Craven; Fred. Hargett, State Senator, of Jones; Richard Dobbs Spaight, the elder, elected Governor that year, of Craven; William H. Hill, member of the Legislature and of Congress, of New Hanover; James Hogg, merchant, of Cumberland; Samuel Ashe, then Judge, afterwards Governor, of New Hanover; John Hay, lawyer, of Cumberland; William Barry Grove, member of Congress, of Cumberland; Col. Wm. Polk, member of the Legislature, then of Mecklenburg; Judge John Williams, of Granville; Alexander Mebane, afterwards member of Congress of Orange; Joel Lane, member of the Senate, of Wake; Alfred Moore, then member of the Legislature,<pb xml:id="p20" n="20"/>
afterwards Judge of the Supreme Court, of Brunswick; Willie Jones, of Halifax; Benjamin Hawkins, Senator in Congress, of Warren; John Haywood, State Treasurer, then of Edgecombe; Rev. Dr. Samuel E. McCorkle, a distinguished preacher and teacher, of Rowan; William Richardson Davie, afterwards Governor, of Halifax; Joseph Dixon, State Senator, afterwards member of Congress, of Lincoln; Joseph McDowell, Jr., member of the Legislature, of Burke; William Porter, member of the Legislature, of Rutherford; Adlai Osborne, Clerk of the Superior Court of his county, a well-read and influential man, of Rowan.</p>
          <p>According to localities, counting New Hanover as an eastern county, and Cumberland, Warren and Guilford as middle counties, there were ten eastern, nine middle and six western trustees.</p>
          <p>Willie Jones submitted a motion, which was adopted, that the Board would not select any particular spot, but would choose by ballot a place with liberty of locating within fifteen miles thereof.</p>
          <p>The places in nomination were as follows: Raleigh, in Wake County; Williamsboro, in Granville County; Hillsboro, in Orange County; Pittsboro, in Chatham County; Cyprett's Bridge, over New Hope, in Chatham; Smithfield, in Johnston County; Goshen, in Granville County.</p>
          <p>The Board proceeded to ballot and Cyprett's or Cipritz's Bridge, now Prince's Bridge, on the great road from New Bern by Raleigh to Pittsboro, was chosen. The fifteen miles radius allowed a range over wide areas of Chatham, Wake and Orange; from the highlands of New Hope to the hills of Buckhorn; from the Hickory Mountain to the eminence overlooking our beautiful capital on the west. The same influences which secured that the capital should be located within ten miles of Isaac Hunter's plantation, in Wake County, that is, as near the centre of the State as possible, carried this vote.</p>
          <p>On the 4th of August, 1792, the Board adopted an ordinance to carry into effect the selection of the University site within the circle described. One commissioner from each judicial district was appointed by ballot. There were from the Morganton<pb xml:id="p21" n="21"/>
District, Wm. Porter, of Rutherford; the Salisbury District, John Hamilton, of Guilford; the Hillsboro District, Alex. Mebane, of Orange; the Halifax District, Willie Jones, of Halifax; the Edenton District, David Stone, of Bertie; the New Bern District, Frederick Hargett, of Jones; the Wilmington District, William H. Hill, of New Hanover; the Fayetteville District, James Hogg, of Cumberland. They were to meet in Pittsboro on November 1, 1792, prepared to visit in person all places deemed eligible.</p>
          <p>At the appointed time a majority convened in Pittsboro, viz.: Hargett, Mebane, Hogg, Hill, Stone, and Jones. It was an excellent committee. Senator Hargett, a Revolutionary captain, had already assisted as commissioner in locating and laying out the city of Raleigh. Alexander Mebane had been a member of the Convention which framed the State Constitution and a useful officer of the Revolutionary army. He had long served the county of Orange in the State Legislature, and the year after this was elected to the Congress of the United States. James Hogg was an influential merchant, afterwards of Hillsborough, among whose descendants are the Binghams, Norwoods, Webbs, Hoopers, and others. Wm. H. Hill, a descendant of Governor Yeamans, was an able lawyer of Wilmington, afterwards State Senator and member of Congress. David Stone, then a member of the House of Commons from Bertie, afterwards Governor and Senator of the United States, was a well educated and accomplished young man. Willie Jones was one of the most active and influential men of the Revolutionary and post-Revolutionary periods, as Chairman of the Committee of Safety, wielding executive authority in 1776, a member of the Continental Congress, likewise a commissioner to select the site for the seat of government.</p>
          <p>We have the journal of these Commissioners, giving a brief account of their labors among the wooded hills of Chatham and Orange in the early days of November, when the forests were clothed with their changing hues of russet and green, gold and crimson, when the squirrels chattered in the hickories and the deer peered curiously through the thick underwood, and the hospitable farmers welcomed them with hearty greetings,<pb xml:id="p22" n="22"/>
and the good ladies brought out their foamiest cider and sweetest courtesies, while on the sideboard, according to the bad customs of that day, stood decanters of dark-hued rum and ruddy apple brandy and the fiery juice of the Indian corn, which delights to flow in the shining of the moon. I give some extracts from the report submitted by the Chairman, Senator Hargett, as it is more satisfactory to have the narration in the language of the old soldier who saw bloody service under Washington.</p>

          <p>The board taking the foregoing into consideration concurred therewith.</p>
          <p>This report shows that, not discouraged at having failed to secure the
	 location of the seat of government at what is now <pb xml:id="p24" n="24"/>the
	 village of Haywood, at the confluence of Haw and Deep Rivers, a determined
	 effort was made to secure the University at the same point. If it had met with
	 success our boys could add boat races to our athletic contests. The land
	 speculators of one hundred years ago bought lots in this town of paper in the
	 confident belief that it was destined to be a commercial and manufacturing
	 city, but Haywood has taken its place by the side of Brunswick, Bath and other
	 vanished or dwarfed “boom-towns” of the past.</p>
          <p>Notice also that Joel Lane, having secured the location of the capital on
	 part of his broad acres, sought ineffectually to capture the University. This
	 shows the combination which carried the vote for Cypritt's Bridge as the centre
	 of the circle inside of which its home should be. Lane had been a Halifax man
	 and was a warm friend of Davie and of Willie Jones. The influence of these
	 three, together with that of the Cape Fear Trustees, was greater than any other
	 locality could command.</p>
          <p>Let me describe the spot selected more particularly, as it appeared to the
	 eyes of the Commissioners.</p>
          <p>The construction of railroads has made a wonderful change in the relative
	 importance of our public highways. In the old days those who made tobacco
	 rolled it away to Petersburg, little wheels being attached to the hogsheads.
	 Those who made corn generally converted it into hogs and drove them on foot to
	 Philadelphia or Charleston. Wheat was ground into flour and sent by wagon to
	 distant markets—to Fayetteville, Wilmington, New Bern, and Petersburg,
	 and the villages by the way. The corn and rye not fed to swine were changed to
	 whiskey and the fruit into brandy, and that which escaped the capacious throats
	 of the neighborhood drinkers was peddled along the road to the rural drinkers
	 or sold in bulk to the village shops. In violation of all rules of political
	 economy a man was at the same time an agriculturist, a manufacturer, a
	 transporter, a wholesale merchant, a retailer and a voracious consumer.</p>
          <p>The returning wagons carried home supplies of molasses and sugar, iron and
	 salt, shot and powder and flints, not forgetting the ribbons and combs and such
	 paraphernalia that ladies <pb xml:id="p25" n="25"/>in all ages will obtain to gild
	 the refined gold of their personal charms. They were the vehicles also of the
	 news of the day, there being no post-office nearer than Tarboro. The wondering
	 neighbors heard from these drivers what was going on in the big
	 world—that Washington had consented to accept a second term of the
	 Presidency, that the heads of the King and Queen of France had rolled into the
	 guillotine basket, that the allied armies had been driven back from the Rhine;
	 and then what has proved to be of more importance than all the victories of the
	 armies or the discrowning of kings that a Yankee schoolmaster, named Whitney,
	 had invented a machine for picking seed out of cotton; and every old lady
	 paused in the musical whir of her spinning-wheel to listen to the astounding
	 intelligence, not more than three months old, that in the old country a man
	 named Arkwright was spinning yarn by water power, and more incredible still a
	 preacher, named Cartwright, was weaving cloth by wood and iron instead of human
	 muscle.</p>
          <p>From these causes the roads of those days, though over them rolled no
	 modern carriages or effeminate buggies, or bicycles, or horse-scaring
	 automobiles, frequently resounded with the heavy wheels of the covered wagons;
	 and the cross-roads were places of importance where wagoners and the neighbors
	 met for business and social enjoyments, listened to political speeches, and
	 more rarely to homely but heart-stirring sermons.</p>
          <p>The great roads from Petersburg to Pittsboro and the country beyond, and
	 from New Bern towards Greensboro and Salisbury crossed on this eminence. At the
	 northeast corner of the cross was a chapel of the Church of England, a sad
	 relic of the futile efforts to establish a church in North Carolina. The
	 locality was called New Hope Chapel Hill or the Hill of New Hope Chapel. The
	 eminence is a promontory of granite, belonging to the Laurentian system, and
	 extends into the sandstone formation to the east, which was once the bed of a
	 long sheet of water stretching from near New York to the centre of Georgia. We
	 have in our Museum pieces of rock formed from the mud and sand at the bottom of
	 this old bay on which are ripple marks of the waves and prints of the plants
	 and animals that grew in its shallows. It was on <pb xml:id="p26" n="26"/>this
	 plateau, elevated 250 feet above the country on the east, 503 feet above the
	 ocean, then as now celebrated for its magnificent forests of oak and hickory,
	 its springs of cool and purest water, its pleasant, mudless, dustless soil, its
	 genial, healthful climate, on whose hillsides the mountain flora blossom, that
	 the home of the University was fixed.</p>
          <p>We are fortunate in having a contemporary description of the site in
	 Davie's own words, when he was full of enthusiasm after eating his dinner,
	 according to tradition, under the old poplar which bears his name.</p>
          <p>“The seat of the University is on the summit of a very high ridge.
	 There is a very gentle declivity of 300 yards to the village, which is situated
	 in a handsome plain, considerably lower than the site of the public buildings,
	 but so greatly elevated above the surrounding country as to furnish an
	 extensive and beautiful landscape, composed of the heights in the vicinity of
	 Eno, Flat and Little Rivers.”</p>
          <p>“The ridge appears to commence about half a mile directly east of
	 the building, where it rises abruptly several hundred feet. This peak is called
	 Point Prospect. The flat country spreads out below like the ocean, giving an
	 immense hemisphere in which the eye seems lost in the extent of
	 space.”</p>
          <p>“There is nothing more remarkable in this extraordinary place than
	 the abundance of springs of the purest and finest water, which burst from the
	 side of the ridge, and which have been the subjects of admiration both to
	 hunters and travelers ever since the discovery and settlement of this part of
	 the country.”</p>
          <p>It will be noticed that the name Point Prospect has been changed to
	 “Piney” Prospect. In old times point was pronounced a pint, and the
	 change was natural, especially as the hill has pines growing on it and masses
	 of these trees are the chief features of the scenery. I add that the water
	 flowing from these springs into the creeks north and south of us have created
	 an endless variety of hill and dale, with surprising wealth of flora, even the
	 rhododendron of the mountains, which Gray stated until Dr. Simonds showed him
	 our plant, could not grow below 1.800 feet.</p>

          <pb xml:id="p27" n="27"/>
          <head>THE DONORS OF THE SITE.</head>
          <p>Nearly all of these donors were part of that band of immigrants, which
		leaving Pennsylvania sought on the waters of the Haw, the Deep, the Yadkin, and
		the Catawba a more peaceful home, one farther removed from warring Indians and
		scheming Frenchmen in the countries bordering on the Alleghany and the
		Monongahela. They were of plain, honest, unambitious stock, possibly more moved
		to their generosity by the hope of increasing the value of the broad acres
		retained by them than by love of letters and far-seeing patriotism.</p>
          <p>Most of what I know of their history I derived from my most intelligent
		friend, the late Captain John R. Hutchings, whose farm lies in full view from
		Piney Prospect on the extreme right.</p>
          <p>Col. John Hogan was an officer of the Revolution, in the militia
		service, which was arduous and perilous, especially when Cornwallis'
		headquarters were at Hillsboro and armed bands of British and Tories were
		harrying the central counties. His residence was in the county of Randolph, and
		his descendants are in that and Davidson counties. One of them was the
		estimable wife of Dr. Wm. R. Holt, a President of the North Carolina
		Agricultural Society and the introducer of Devon cattle and other blooded stock
		into the valley of the Yadkin. She was the nearest relation to the benefactress
		of the University, Mary Ruffin Smith.</p>
          <p>Matthew and William McCauley were of the few who came over directly from
		the north of Ireland. They were from the county of Antrim. According to
		tradition Matthew, when a youth, became involved in one of the numerous
		insurrections against British rule, and, concealed in a hogshead, was shipped
		as freight to the colonies in the new world. Settling on Morgan's Creek he, by
		industry and skill, succeeded in buying much land and establishing a mill on
		that creek of such wide celebrity that the roads in the neighborhood were
		marked off by the number of miles to it. He owned also a blacksmith shop, which
		met with a large patronage in the days when nails and horseshoes were made by
		hand. His dwelling still stands, low-pitched, high-roofed, with small windows
		on the old Hillsboro and Pittsboro road. The mill has gone to decay.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p28" n="28"/>
          <p>Matthew McCauley was thrown on his own resources before having an
		opportunity to procure book education, but was a very intelligent man and good
		citizen. A story told on him seems to prove the truth of the statement that
		“there are no snakes in Ireland.” Shortly after his arrival in
		Orange County he was struck by the beauty of a rattlesnake which crossed his
		path. He caught it, fortunately around the neck, and carried it to an old lady
		with the inquiry, “what is this pretty beast?” Following the
		terrified advice of the lady he succeeded in throwing it away so as to escape
		its poisonous fangs. Another story was considered very mirthful in the old
		days. A neighbor made him a gift of a pair of snuffers, most useful when
		home-made tallow candles were in vogue. He carried them home in triumph, and
		when the light became dim snuffed the candle with his fingers as usual and
		deposited the charred end of the wick in the snuffers with the triumphant
		remark that it was very “usiary,” (useful).</p>
          <p>He was a faithful soldier in the Revolutionary army. The General
		Assembly raised the grades of officers of the line, so that he was after the
		war a captain, but on the roster of Continental officers he is placed as first
		lieutenant of the 10th Regiment of Continental troops, his commission being
		dated April 19, 1777, Abraham Shepard being his colonel. While engaged under
		orders in recruiting service he was captured by the Tories and imprisoned for
		three months. Such was his hatred of Tories that even in old age, though of
		only medium size, he was eager to pick a quarrel and fight with any of that
		party whom he chanced to meet.</p>
          <p>He left many children. One of his sons settled in Kentucky. Another, a
		lawyer, William by name, was a student and then steward of the University.
		William left two sons, one of them, Samuel, was once Mayor of Monroe; the
		other, Charles Maurice Talleyrand McCauley, was a gallant captain in the
		Confederate army, a good lawyer and, as Senator from Union in the General
		Assembly, was always a supporter of the institution, which his grandfather
		helped to provide. A grandson, bearing the honored name of Matthew McCauley,
		resides on a part of the old plantation, though not in the old home.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p29" n="29"/>
          <p>William McCauley, a brother of the first Matthew, lived a few miles west
		of Chapel Hill in the district called the “Great Meadows,” a leader
		in his county. He is the ancestor of the prosperous merchant of Chapel Hill,
		David McCauley, who is also a descendant of Matthew McCauley, by the
		“spindle,” i. e., female line. William was a member of the lower
		house of the General Assembly during most of the Revolutionary War, and of the
		Senate from 1784 to 1788 inclusive. The confidence of the people of Orange was
		further shown to him by sending him as a delegate to the Convention of 1788
		held at Hillsborough, which postponed the ratification of the Constitution of
		the United States. In common with the rest of the Orange delegates he voted for
		the postponement.</p>
          <p>Benjamin Yeargin was a son of the Rev. Andrew Yeargin, a Methodist
		preacher in Virginia and North Carolina, after whom the first Methodist church
		in Virginia, Yeargan's Chapel, was named. Benjamin was a worthy farmer, owning
		the land for a long distance along Bowlin's Creek. He was also the schoolmaster
		of the neighborhood. His mill, part of the mudsill still in situ, at a romantic
		defile called Glenburnie, was the first in the southern part of Orange County.
		His dwelling-house was near the creek. The northern part of his land is the
		farm owned by Mr. Oregon Tenney, and in it boarded President Polk, Judge
		William H. Battle and other students who preferred to walk nearly two miles
		over the rough hills rather than take meals at Steward's Hall. One of his sons,
		Mark Morgan Yeargin, was a student of the University in 1807, and settled at
		Henderson in Kentucky. His descendants are now over many States, principally
		North Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky. Two of them, Leonidas Hillary Yeargan,
		of New York, and Hillary H. L. Yeargan, M.D., of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, have
		published a neat booklet—the origin and genealogy of the Yeargan family
		from 1730 to 1890.
		<ref xml:id="ref1" target="#n1">*</ref>
            <note xml:id="n1" anchored="true" target="#ref1">*The name was spelt differently by different members of the family,
		  Yeargin, Yeargan, Yeargon.</note></p>
          <p>Christopher Barbee, familiarly known as “Old Kit,” one of
		the largest landowners of this county, had his residence on a commanding
		eminence called The Mountain, three miles <pb xml:id="p30" n="30"/>east of the
		village of Chapel Hill. He was a familiar figure for many years, said Dr.
		Charles Phillips, riding into the village on horseback with a little negro
		behind him, his destination being his blacksmith shop on Main street. He had
		two sons, William and Willis. William increased an estate already considerable,
		and at one time represented the county in the Legislature. Willis was a
		physician in the same neighborhood, after being a student of the University in
		1818. One of the granddaughters of William Barbee married Wm. R. Kenan, of
		Wilmington. Their son was a recent student and instructor in the University. A
		great-grandson, William B. Stewart, was a graduate in 1881, and another, John
		Guthrie, was a student in 1896. A grandson, Belfield William Cave, was a
		graduate of 1848; and another, William F. Hargrave, was a student in 1866. The
		mill at the foot of the upper Laurel Hill, to which so many pilgrimages are
		made by young men and maidens, was known for many years as Barbee's Mill, and
		then Cave's Mill, after the name of one of his sons-in-law.</p>
          <p>The land on which the mill just mentioned was built was in 1792 the
		property of John Daniel, another of the donors. His residence was on the road
		between the mill and the village, and the grave of the owner is very near it.
		He was the surveyor for the Trustees, and his map of the University lands and
		vicinity is in our archives. After his death his family moved to the
		Mississippi Territory, now State.</p>
          <p>Mark Morgan, one of the earliest settlers, lived on his lands, bought of
		Earl Granville, three miles southeast of the village, the land reaching to the
		summit of New Hope Chapel Hill. Of his two sons John moved west in 1823, and
		Solomon lived and died on the homestead. Half of his land, about 800 acres
		including the homestead, descended to his daughter, Mary Elizabeth, the wife of
		Rev. James Pleasant Mason. She bequeathed it to the University to found a fund
		in memory of her daughters, Martha and Varina, who died within a month of one
		another just after budding into womanhood.</p>
          <p>In the latter part of his life. Solomon, who had been a man of
		neighborhood prominence, a Justice of the Peace, became feeble-minded and a
		guardian of his property was appointed <pb xml:id="p31" n="31"/>He was allowed to
		have a horse of his own, and on one occasion swapped horses with a traveler,
		obtaining in exchange a noble black much superior to his own. Discovering that
		he had been overreached the trader endeavored to procure a rescission of the
		trade, and on Solomon's refusal threatened to appeal to his guardian.
		“Oh,” said Solomon, “my guardian was appointed to keep people
		from cheating me and not to keep me from cheating them.” And he kept his
		horse. It was his son Samuel who, when under conviction of his sins in
		consequence of the eloquent preaching at a revival, was heard, when on his
		knees in a solitary hay-loft, to utter this unique prayer, “Oh, Lord!
		they accuse Sam Morgan of doing this and that wicked thing, but, Oh Lord! it's
		a d—d lie.”</p>
          <p>Hardy Morgan was the brother of Mark. His lands lay on Bowlin's Creek,
		east of the village, now the property of Robert F. Strowd. The son, Samuel, who
		inherited the home place is described as “one of nature's
		noblemen,” so free from guile as to lose nearly all his property by
		becoming surety for Sheriff Nat King who fled to Tennessee after bankrupting
		his friends. One of his slaves, Tom, having been bought by a trader who
		designed to carry him to the Southwest for sale, ran away and for several years
		had two hiding places, one a cave on Morgan's Creek and the other in a very
		thick copse of wood near his old master's residence, under the lee of
		overhanging rocks. Rough boards leaning against the rocks made a dismal shelter
		from the rain. Under them was a shoemaker's bench and a pile of leaves for his
		couch. He lived partly by robbery, partly by food brought by his mother, whose
		cabin was near, but on the opposite side of the hill. There seemed to be little
		desire to molest him until he began to break into the stores of the village in
		search for meat. Then a posse was summoned for his capture. Marching through
		the forest at regular intervals—a process known as “beating the
		woods”—the men aroused him from his lair, and, on his refusal to
		stop when commanded, he was shot in the legs, captured and then sent south for
		sale. I have never seen the cave on Morgan's Creek but visited the den in the
		woods the day after his capture. I remember the shoemaker's bench and the
		fragments of leather, the scattered bones, <pb xml:id="p32" n="32"/>relics of his
		solitary meals, and my young mind was shocked inexpressibly at the resemblance
		of poor Tom's habitation to the lair of a wild beast.</p>
          <p>It is gratifying to know that the old age of Samuel Morgan was relieved
		by the acquisition of a competent livelihood in right of his wife. Allen, the
		other son of Hardy Morgan, was dissipated and he and his descendants became
		impoverished.</p>
          <p>James Craig lived in the house still occupied by one of his descendants
		in the extreme western part of the village. He was a quiet, reserved, good man,
		so absent-minded that on one occasion he rode on horseback to New Hope church
		and then walked home about seven miles, forgetting that he had a horse, saddled
		and bridled, hitched near the church door. I heard President Andrew Johnson, in
		a speech delivered from President Swain's front steps, tell how, when on his
		way from Raleigh to seek his fortune in Tennessee, having walked from Raleigh,
		28 miles, penniless and weary, he begged for a supper and a night's lodging at
		James Craig's. With softened voice he spoke of the cordial hospitality with
		which he was received, and how after abundant meals and a good night's rest he
		was cheered on his lonely journey by kind words and a full supply of food in
		his pockets.</p>
          <p>For many years “Craigs,” or “Fur (far) Craigs,”
		as the place was called, to distinguish it from a Craig residence nearer the
		village, was a favorite boarding house for those not adverse to long walks. Dr.
		Hooper tells in his “Fifty Years Since” how ambitious
		“spreads” of fried chicken and other dainties were served up to
		parties of students, seeking a change from the monotony of the ancient Commons.
		I remember that on one sad occasion a squad of unfortunates, among them one
		destined to be an eminent Confederate general, whose hands bore the signs of
		the presence of the dreaded <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="gre">sarcoptes
		scabei</foreign>,</hi>were quarantined at this remote spot in sulphurous
		loneliness, under the sway of the terrible demon, “Old Scratch”</p>
          <p>Two of James Craig's children lived to the advanced age of 84 or 85
		years on the homestead. His son James graduated at the University in 1816 in
		the class of John Y. Mason, Wm. Julius Alexander, and others. James Francis
		Craig, his grandson, <pb xml:id="p33" n="33"/>a student of the University in 1852,
		recently died on the old homestead. Another grandson, Wm. Harrison Craig, a
		graduate of 1868, is a successful lawyer in Arkansas.</p>
          <p>Alexander Piper was a plain farmer who removed to Fayette County,
		Tennessee, many years ago.</p>
          <p>Edmund Jones, a most valuable citizen in his county, was a soldier in
		the Revolutionary War. Marrying Miss Rachel Alston he settled as a farmer near
		Chapel Hill, but soon after the location of the University removed to Chatham
		County and established himself on Ephraim's Creek, on the present line of the
		Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railroad, midway between Siler City and Ore Hill.
		He is buried about twelve feet from the road. He died in 1834 at the age of 85
		years. He left three sons, two of whom resided in North Carolina, and the third
		moved West. His descendants are scattered all over the South and Southwest. One
		of his sons, Atlas Jones, was an alumnus, then a tutor of the University,
		1804-'06, then a Trustee. He was a lawyer of prominence and a member of the
		General Assembly from Moore County. A lawyer of much natural ability, but of
		irregular habits, often in the Legislature from Anson, noted for his power of
		discomforting opponents by humorous ridicule, Atlas Jones Dargan, was named
		after him.</p>
          <p>Thomas Connelly was once owner of the Matthew McCauley mill tract.
		Seized by the fever for emigrating he removed to Georgia. He sold his Orange
		County possessions and his name has disappeared from this neighborhood. He was
		a Virginian and married Miss Mary Price, of Norfolk, in that State. He died at
		the age of 82, leaving eleven sons and five daughters, most of them married.
		His descendants are scattered from Georgia to Texas.</p>

          <head>THE LAYING OF THE CORNERSTONE OF THE OLD EAST <lb/>BUILDING.</head>
          <p>The report of the Commissioners was referred to a committee consisting
		of Davie, McCorckle, Jones, Ashe, and Sitgreaves. Jones, as chairman, reported
		an ordinance ratifying their action, which was unanimously adopted. At a
		previous <pb xml:id="p34" n="34"/>meeting a committee of which Senator Hawkins was
		chairman, recommended the plan of a building 120 feet by 50, three stories
		high, with a dining-room on the first floor 40 feet by 30, and a public hall on
		the second and third floors of the same dimensions. This plan was for want of
		means not approved, and on motion of Davie the location and construction of a
		building sufficiently large to accommodate 50 students, and also the laying out
		the village of Chapel Hill and selling lots therein, were directed to be
		entrusted to seven commissioners, styled the Building Committee, to be elected
		by ballot.</p>
          <p>The following were chosen: Alfred Moore, W. R. Davie, Fred. Hargett,
		Thomas H. Blount, Alexander Mebane, John Williams and John Haywood, certainly
		worthy of full confidence.</p>
          <p>The committee reported, through John Haywood, at their meeting in
		Fayetteville in December, 1793. They had met in Hillsboro in April of that year
		and contracted with George Daniel, of Orange County, for making 350,000 bricks
		for 40 shillings ($4) per thousand. On the 10th of August following they
		met at Chapel Hill, marked off sites for the buildings, “together with
		the necessary quantity of land for offices, avenues and ornamental
		grounds.” They then laid off the village into lots. In addition to the
		beauty and natural advantages of the place, they reported that it is
		“happily accommodated to the introduction and direction of several
		important public roads, which it is highly probable will in the future lead
		through it.” They found that a tract of eighty acres, belonging to Hardy
		Morgan ran inconveniently near the buildings, and therefore bought it for
		$200. On the 19th of July they contracted with James Patterson, of
		Chatham County, for erecting a two-storied brick building, 96 feet 7 inches
		long and 40 feet 1 1-2 inches wide, for $5,000, the University to
		furnish the brick, sash weights, locks, hooks, fastenings and painting. The
		building was to contain 16 rooms with four passages, and to be finished by the
		1st of November, 1794. The cornerstone was laid on the 12th of October, 1793,
		and on the same day the lots in the village, reserving a four-acre lot for a
		residence for the President, were sold for £1.534 ($3,168),
		payable in one and two years, good security being given. It was thought
		<pb xml:id="p35" n="35"/>that “the amount of the sales furnishes a pleasing
		and undeniable proof of the high estimation in which the beautiful spot is
		held.” The report is signed by Davie, Moore, Mebane, Blount, and Haywood,
		from which it is inferrible that Hargett and Williams did not act. The 80-acre
		tract included the land east of the buildings next to the Raleigh road, which
		is <choice><sic>propably</sic><corr>probably</corr></choice>the oldest cleared land of the
		University site. There are traces on it of a cottage, which was probably
		tenanted at the time of the purchase.</p>
          <p>The 12th of October was the date of many great events in the world's
		history—of the discovery of America by Columbus, of the birth of that
		grand evolution of Anglo-Norman-American character, Robert E. Lee, and of our
		active, progressive, and able ex-President of the University, George Tayloe
		Winston. In the year 1877 it was made a holiday, University Day. General Davie,
		as Grand Master of the Free and Accepted Order of Masons, officiated, and Rev.
		Dr. Samuel E. McCorckle delivered the address, on the occasion of the laying of
		the corner-stone.</p>
          <p>We have fortunately an account of the proceedings of this day so
		memorable, written by Davie himself, the chief actor. I will endeavor to take
		the veil from this picture of long ago, and wipe off the dust which obscures
		it.</p>
          <p>The Chapel Hill of 113 years ago was vastly different from the Chapel
		Hill of to-day. It was covered with a primeval growth of forest trees, with
		only one or two settlements and a few acres of clearing. Even the trees on the
		East and West Avenue, named Cameron by the Faculty in recognition of the wise
		and skillful superintendence by P. C. Cameron of the extensive repairs of our
		buildings prior to the re-opening in 1875, were still erect. The sweetgums and
		dogwoods and maples were relieving with their russet and golden hues the
		general green of the forest. A long procession of people for the first time is
		marching along the narrow road, afterwards to be widened into a noble avenue.
		Many of them are clad in the striking, typical insignia of the Masonic
		Fraternity, their Grand Master arrayed in the full decorations of his rank.
		They march with military tread, because most of them have seen service, many
		scarred with wounds of horrid war. Their faces are <pb xml:id="p36" n="36"/>
		serious, for they feel that they are engaged in a great work. They are
		proceeding to lay the foundations of an institution which for weal or woe is to
		shape the minds of thousands of unborn children; whose influence will be felt
		more and more, ever widening and deepening as the years roll on, as one of the
		great forces of civilization.</p>
          <p>Let us transport ourselves in imagination and look on this strange
		procession and see if we can recognize any of them as they step firmly in the
		pleasant sunshine of the autumnal sun.</p>
          <p>The tall, commanding figure most conspicuous in the Grand Master's
		regalia is that of William Richardson Davie, whom I have heretofore described.
		The distinguished looking man, “small in statue, neat in his dress,
		elegant in his manner,” next to Davie, is Davie's great rival, Alfred
		Moore. Judge Murphey gives us a vivid picture of him also: “His voice was
		clear and sonorous, his perception quick and judgment almost intuitive. His
		style was chaste and manner of speaking animated. Having adopted Swift for his
		model, his language was always plain. The clearness and energy of his mind
		enabled him almost without an effort to disentangle the most intricate subject
		and expose it in all its parts to the simplest understanding. He spoke with
		ease and with force, enlivened his discourse with flashes of wit, and where the
		subject required it with all the bitterness of sarcasm. His speeches were short
		and impressive. When he sat down every one thought he had said everything he
		ought to have said.” His learning and acquirements secured for him a seat
		on the bench of one of the most august tribunals in the world—the Supreme
		Court of the United States.</p>
          <p>In that procession appeared one too who had highest reputation among his
		contemporaries as an enlightened lawyer, William H. Hill, heretofore described,
		father of the brilliant young man whose death filled the whole State with
		grief, Joseph A. Hill.</p>
          <p>We next see one who was for many years the most popular man in North
		Carolina, John Haywood. For forty years—1787 to 1827—he was
		Treasurer of the State. His hospitality was unbounded. He made it a rule to
		invite specially to an entertainment at his house at each session of the
		General Assembly, <pb xml:id="p37" n="37"/>which then met annually, every member.
		His kindness and charity were absolutely inexhaustible. In reading over the
		University records I find that for over thirty years he scarcely missed a
		meeting of the Board, whether held at Chapel Hill or Raleigh. His name is
		perpetuated not only by the memory of his distinguished sons, but by one of our
		loveliest mountain counties and by a neighboring town, which once aspired to be
		the capital of the State and site of the University.</p>
          <p>Marching with Haywood was Gen. Alexander Mebane, of the old Scotch-Irish
		stock, who settled the Haw Fields in Alamance, something of whose history has
		been given.</p>
          <p>In that procession was also John Williams, founder of Williamsboro, in
		Granville County, whose strong, sturdy sense enabled him to step with short
		interval from the bench of the carpenter to the bench of the judge of the first
		court under the Constitution of 1776. He was likewise a member of the Congress
		of the Confederation.</p>
          <p>Thomas Blount, member from Edgecombe, soon to enter Congress and to
		become an attached colleague of Nathaniel Macon, was likewise present.</p>
          <p>Prominent in this procession was the venerable Hargett, Senator from
		Jones, plain, solid, but eminently trustworthy.</p>
          <p>After these came other Trustees. Who they were, with the exception of
		McCorkle, we have no record.</p>
          <p>After the Trustees march State officers, not Trustees; among them Judge
		Spruce McKoy, of Salisbury, and doubtless John Taylor, the first Steward of the
		University, and the officers of the county; and then followed the gentlemen of
		the vicinity, the donors of the land and their neighbors, and among them
		Patterson, of Chatham, the contractor for the building. Since that day we have
		had processions, year by year, on our Commencement days, and in their columns
		men learned and distinguished in all the pursuits of life, but never has there
		been a procession more imposing than that which laid the cornerstone of the Old
		East, on the 12th day of October, 1793.</p>
          <p>The orator of the day, Dr. Samuel E. McCorkle, was one of the most noted
		educators of that period. He was one of the sturdy Scotch-Irish, who made the
		north of Ireland famous throughout all lands for triumphs of intelligent
		industry and <pb xml:id="p38" n="38"/>thrift, whose glorious defence of Londonderry
		stands unexcelled in the annals of human valor and endurance; who gave to North
		Carolina many of its leaders in war and peace—Grahams and Jacksons,
		Johnstons, Brevards, Alexanders, Mebanes and hosts of others, but above all
		most of its faithful and zealous instructors of youth, such as Dr. Caldwell, of
		Guilford, and Dr. Caldwell, of the University, Dr. Ker and Mr. Harris, its
		first professors, and that progenitor of a line of able and cultured teachers
		and founder of a school eminent for nearly a century for its widespread and
		multiform usefulness, William Bingham, <hi rend="italics">the first.</hi></p>
          <p>Dr. McCorkle was among the foremost of these. He was beyond his
		generation as a teacher. His school at Thyatira, six miles west of Salisbury,
		spread abroad not only classical learning but sound religious training. He
		attached to it a department specially for teachers—the first normal
		school, I feel sure, in America. The first class which graduated at our
		University consisted of seven members; six of them had been pupils of Dr.
		McCorkle. And it is gratifying that one of the first graduates of the revived
		University was a relative of his, George McCorkle, of Catawba, the Chief
		Marshal of 1876.</p>
          <p>The name Zion-Parnassus, which he gave to his school at Thyatira, shows
		how he combined the culture of the Bible and the culture of the Muses. The
		first Board of Trustees of the University was composed of the greatest men of
		the State, and among them—Senators, Governors, Judges of the Supreme
		Court of the United States and of the State—was Dr. McCorkle, the
		solitary preacher and solitary teacher. He was one of the best friends the
		University had; worked for it, begged for it, preached for it. It was most
		fitting that he should deliver the first address at the University, to be
		followed by a long line of eloquent men.</p>
          <p>We have a report of the address made by Dr. McCorkle on this momentous
		occasion. It is replete with wisdom and noble thoughts, and proves that the
		estimation placed on him by the men of his day was fully earned.</p>
          <p>“Observing on the natural and necessary connection between
		learning and religion, and the importance of religion to the
		<pb xml:id="p39" n="39"/>promotion of national happiness and national undertakings,
		he said,” “It is our duty to acknowledge that sacred scriptural
		truth, except the Lord build the house they labor in vain who build it. Except
		the Lord watcheth the city the watchman walketh but in vain.” For my own
		part I feel myself prostrated with a sense of these truths, and this I feel not
		only as a minister of religion, but also as a citizen of the State—as a
		member of the civil as well as the religious society.”</p>
          <p>After laying down the proposition that the happiness of mankind is
		increased by the advancement of learning and science, the doctor observed,
		“Happiness is the centre to which all the duties of man and people tend.
		. . . To diffuse the greatest possible degree of happiness in a given territory
		is the aim of good government and religion. Now the happiness of a nation
		depends on national wealth and national glory and cannot be gained without
		them. They in like manner depend on liberty and good laws. Liberty and laws
		call for general knowledge in the people and extensive knowledge in matters of
		the State, and these in turn demand public places of education. . . . How can
		any nation be happy without national wealth? How can that nation or man be
		happy that is not procuring and securing the necessary conveniences and
		accommodations of life; ease without indolence and plenty without luxury or
		waste? How can glory or wealth be procured without liberty and laws? They must
		check luxury, encourage industry and protect wealth. They must secure me the
		glory of my actions and save me from a bow-string or a bastille. And how are
		these objects to be gained without general knowledge? Knowledge is
		wealth—it is glory—whether among philosophers, ministers of State
		or religion, or among the great mass of the people. Britons glory in the name
		of Newton and have honored him with a place among the sepulchres of their
		kings. Americans glory in the name of Franklin, and every nation boasts of her
		great men, who has them. Savages cannot have, rather cannot educate them,
		though many a Newton has been born and buried among them. Knowledge is liberty
		and law. When the clouds of ignorance have been dispelled by the radiance of
		knowledge power trembles, but the authority of the <pb xml:id="p40" n="40"/>laws
		remain inviolable; and how this knowledge productive of so many advantages to
		mankind can be acquired without public places of education I know
		not.”</p>
          <p>The eyes of the orator kindled as he looked into the future. “The
		seat of the University was next sought for,” he said, “and the
		public eye selected Chapel Hill—a lovely situation in the centre of the
		State, at a convenient distance from the capital, in a healthy and fertile
		neighborhood. May this hill be for religion as the ancient hill of Zion; and
		for literature and the muses, may it surpass the ancient Parnassus! We this day
		enjoy the pleasure of seeing the cornerstone of the University, its material
		and the architect for the building, and we hope ere long to see its stately
		walls and spire ascending to their summit. Ere long we hope to see it adorned
		with an elegant village, accommodated with all the necessaries and conveniences
		of civilized society.”</p>
          <p>“The discourse was followed by a short but animated prayer, closed
		with the united amen of an immense concourse of people.”</p>
          <p>We thank thee for thy golden words, thou venerable father of education
		in our State. On this foundation the University desires to rest, the
		enlightenment of the people, their instruction not alone in secular learning
		but in religious truth, leading up to and sustaining liberty by demanding and
		shaping beneficent laws under which wealth may be accumulated and individual
		happiness and national glory be secured, all sanctified by the blessings of
		God; these are the objects, these are the methods, these are the good rewards
		of the University.</p>
          <p>But the beginnings of the University were in troublous times. Its
		struggles were not only with want and penury, but with ignorance and prejudice
		and a wild spirit of lawlessness.</p>
          <p>All the world was in a ferment. The passions of the era flamed across
		the ocean and enkindled sympathetic passions in our midst. Furious efforts were
		made to force the United States into alliance with the French Republic. The
		vision of the sister democracies of the Old World and the New, marching
		shoulder to shoulder to plant in every capital the standard of universal
		freedom, and conquering together a universal peace, <pb xml:id="p41" n="41"/>
		aroused every sentiment of romantic philanthropy and quixotic gratitude.</p>
          <p>The rage of parties was strong in North Carolina, as elsewhere. It stood
		in the way of all measures for the advancement of the public good. It
		stimulated bad passions, prevented co-operation, divided the people into
		hostile camps. In the general excitement the cause of education was little
		regarded, and but for the wisdom of such men as Davie and Moore and Mebane and
		Haywood and Hill the new-born University would have been strangled in its
		infancy.</p>
          <p>The population of the State was only about 400,000, of whom about
		100,000 were slaves. The permanent seat of government had just been chosen. The
		city of Raleigh was located in 1792, the State-house was not finished until
		1794. The inhabitants of the State lived remote from one another, and mutual
		intercourse was prevented not only by long distances but by the execrable roads
		and the almost entire absence of spring vehicles. The two-wheeled sulky and
		stick-back gig were possessed by the better class, while only a few of the
		wealthiest could boast of the lumbering coach. Most traveling was on horseback,
		it being quite the fashion for the lady to sit behind the gentleman and steady
		herself by an arm around his waist.</p>
          <p>The diffusion of intelligence through most of the regions of the State
		was by the chance traveler or the wagoner. In 1790 there were only 75
		post-offices in all the Union, now there are over 70,000. There were only 1,875
		miles of post roads in all the Union, now there are over 400,000. Then there
		was only one letter to 17 people, now there are over 20 letters to each person.
		Then there were only 265,500 letters carried in a year; now there are largely
		over 1,000,000,000. Then the postage was from seven to 33 cents, according to
		distance; now for two cents a letter will go with great certainty to the shores
		of the Pacific, even to distant Alaska among the frozen latitudes. In his
		message to the Legislature of 1790 Governor Alexander Martin complained that
		there is only one mail route in the State, and that runs only through the
		seaboard towns; that only a few inhabitants derive advantage from that
		establishment in comparison to the general bulk of the people of the interior
		country. <pb xml:id="p42" n="42"/>Five years afterwards Prof. Harris, when a weekly
		mail had been established, writes, “Our news at this place (Chapel Hill)
		has given us more trouble and disappointment than information. I joined Mr.
		Ker, acting president, in getting Browne's daily paper, but it has not arrived
		by the two last posts, and if it does not come more regularly we must
		discontinue it.” The old records show that it was a common practice to
		send a special messenger, called an “express,” when important
		communication became necessary between the University authorities and the
		Trustees.</p>
          <p>The state of education was at a low ebb. There were no public schools
		and few private schools. I am fortunately able to give information on this
		subject from Judge Archibald Murphey, an early student of the University; after
		his graduation one of its professors. He says: “Before this University
		came into operation in 1795 there were not more than three schools in the State
		in which the rudiments of a classical education could be acquired. The most
		prominent and useful of these schools was kept by Mr. David Caldwell, of
		Guilford County. He initiated it shortly after the close of the war and
		continued it for more than thirty years. The usefulness of Dr. Caldwell to the
		literature of the State will never be sufficiently appreciated, but the
		opportunities of instruction in the school were very limited. There was no
		library attached to it. His students were supplied with a few of the Greek and
		Latin classics, Euclid's Elements of Mathematics and Martin's Natural
		Philosophy. Moral Philosophy was taught from a syllabus of lectures by Dr.
		Witherspoon in Princeton College. The students had no books on history or
		miscellaneous literature. There were very few indeed in the State, except in
		the libraries of lawyers who lived in the commercial towns. I well remember
		that after completing my course of studies under Dr. Caldwell, I spent nearly
		two years without finding any books to read except old works on theological
		subjects. At length I accidentally met with Voltaire's History of Charles XII.
		of Sweden, and an odd volume of Smollett's Roderick Random and an abridgement
		of Don Quixote. These books gave me a taste for reading which I had no
		opportunity of gratifying <pb xml:id="p43" n="43"/>until I became a student of the
		University in 1796. Few of Dr. Caldwell's students had better opportunities of
		getting books than myself, and with those slender opportunities of instruction
		it is not at all surprising that so few have become eminent in the liberal
		professions. At this day (1827) when libraries are established in all our
		towns, when every professional man and every respectable gentleman has a
		collection of books, it is difficult to conceive the inconvenience under which
		young men labored thirty or forty years ago.” And yet there were men who,
		like Judge Murphey, conquered all these difficulties and rose, conspicuous for
		learning and science.</p>
          <p>I am satisfied that Judge Murphey was mistaken as to the number of
		classical schools. There were others, but very far from being sufficient to
		supply the needs of the State.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italics">North American Review</hi>in 1821 said that,
		“In an ardent and increasing zeal for the establishment of schools and
		academies for several years past, we do not believe North Carolina has been
		outdone by a single State. The academy at Raleigh was founded in 1804,
		previously to which there were only two institutions of the kind in the State.
		The number at present is nearly forty, and is rapidly increasing. Great pains
		are taken to procure the best instructors from different parts of the country,
		and we have the best authority for our opinion, that in no part of the Union
		are the interests of education better understood and under better regulation
		than in the middle counties of North Carolina. The schools for females are
		particularly celebrated and are much resorted to from Georgia, South Carolina
		and Virginia. In the year 1816 the number of students at academies within the
		compass of forty miles amounted to more than one thousand.”</p>
          <p>Soon after the laying of the cornerstone of the Old East, the
		President's dwelling was begun. This was located opposite to the present
		Commons Hall, and is now occupied by Prof. Gore. It was the residence of
		Professor Ker, then of Professor Gillaspie; then for some years of President
		Caldwell. In the year 1807 he married the widow of William Hooper, son of the
		signer of the Declaration of Independence, who had removed from Hillsboro to
		Chapel Hill in order to educate her sons; he <pb xml:id="p44" n="44"/>then removed
		to her residence at the southeast corner of Franklin and Hillsboro streets.
		This caused the “President's house” to become the residence of
		professors.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>SALE OF VILLAGE LOTS.</head>
          <p>After the ceremonies of laying the cornerstone, was had the sale of
		villages lots. A careful inspection of the map of the town preserved among the
		Harris papers and of the deeds given by the Commissioners of sale show clearly
		the plan. A broad avenue, called the Grand Avenue, 290 feet wide, being the
		distance between the eastern side of the East Building and the western side of
		the West Building, was laid out on paper, extending from the north front of the
		South Building northwardly to the limits of the University land, considerably
		beyond the present village school-house. Person Hall (Old Chapel) was located
		to front on this avenue.</p>
          <p>Another avenue about 150 feet wide was designed to extend from the South
		Building eastwardly to Piney Prospect. The lots on both sides of Franklin or
		Main street, with the exception of those included in the Grand Avenue, were
		squares of two acres each, as were also those along Columbia Avenue. These
		two-acre lots were numbered 1 to 24; those west of Columbia Avenue, beginning
		at the south, being numbers 1, 3, 5, 7; those on the east being 2, 4, 6, 8; the
		two latter as well as 5 and 7 being on Franklin street. To the east of 6 on
		Franklin street were the odd numbers 9 to 23, the spaces occupied by Grand
		Avenue and Raleigh street not being included; that at the southeast corner of
		Franklin and Raleigh streets being No. 19. Similarly on the north side of
		Franklin street from No. 8, usually known as the Hargrave lot, to the east are
		the even numbers 10 to 24; that known as the Thompson lot being No. 18.</p>
          <p>Besides these there were five lots of four acres each, Nos. 1 and 2
		being the lots from Commons Hall to the Pittsboro road. Nos. 3 and 4 being east
		and west of Grand Avenue and north of Rosemary street, No. 5 being east of
		Hillsboro street and north of Rosemary, and No. 6 being the Battle lot, touched
		by no street, evidently set apart for sale because a spring was within its
		limits.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p45" n="45"/>
          <p>The campus, then called ornamental grounds, was planned to be far larger
		than at present. It was a square, extending eastwardly to the front line of No.
		6 four-acre lot, and the same distance into the forest on the south, beyond the
		old brickyard. The general changes in the plan have been the restricting of the
		campus into its present stone-wall limits and the sale of that part of the
		Grand Avenue which lies north of Franklin street. The first encroachment was a
		Union church, called the village chapel, for holding religious services on
		Sunday nights, on Franklin street about the middle of Grand Avenue, the
		professors contributing the major part of the building fund. In the course of
		time the lot on which it was situated was sold to the Presbyterians for their
		church, and the lots to the west of it were disposed of for various purposes.
		The old village chapel was moved northward and was recently the town
		school-house. Another portion of Grand Avenue was bought by the Methodists as a
		site for their church, and, when they concluded to build another, some northern
		Congregationalists bought it for a school and church for the colored. It has
		since been sold into private hands.</p>
          <p>Long afterwards, about 1830, when Gerrard Hall was built, the
		authorities of that day had a quixotic notion to force the University to turn
		its back to the village and its face towards the south, a stately east and west
		avenue to run from the Raleigh to the Pittsboro road. The southern porch of
		Gerrard Hall, recently taken down, is a memento of this abortive project.</p>
          <p>It is interesting to read the list of purchasers at the sale of 1793. I
		regret that I have been unable to find the number of the lots each purchased,
		but by the researches of Mr. S. M. Gattis I can give fair specimens. The last
		descendant of an original purchaser who continued to hold the land bought was
		Mrs. Mary Kenan, of Wilmington, wife of Wm. R. Kenan, whose mother, Mrs. Jesse
		Hargrave, was a granddaughter of Christopher Barbee. She has recently sold it.
		The following is the list of purchasers, the terms of sale being twelve months'
		credit:</p>

          <p>The Commissioners reported £30 more than this. The auctioneer was
		John G. Rencher, and he was paid $20. John Daniel was the surveyor and
		received $16.</p>
          <p>The lot bid off by Alfred Moore, one of the Commissioners, for £32
		($64) was transferred to William H. Hill, and by him to Thomas Taylor, a
		merchant. After building a house on it and living therein for many years Taylor
		removed to Tennessee, selling it to the University. It is the land east of the
		Episcopal church extending to the Raleigh road, now occupied by Dr.
		Alexander.</p>
          <p>The Charles Collier lot ($134) is that at the corner of Hillsboro
		and Franklin street, now owned by the heirs of Henry Thompson.</p>
          <p>John Grant Rencher was the father of the late Abram Rencher, member of
		Congress and Charge d' Affairs to Portugal. He bought No. 5 lot of four acres
		for $74.50, No. 19, that <pb xml:id="p47" n="47"/>at the southeast corner of
		Franklin and Raleigh streets, and that opposite for $77 each.</p>
          <p>The four-acre Battle lot, No. 6, was purchased by Andrew Burke, a
		merchant of Hillsboro, for $150. The highest priced were the two-acre
		lots No. 11, where is now Roberson's Hotel, $142, or $71 per
		acre, the purchaser being George Johnston; No. 12 opposite, on part of which is
		the residence of the late Dr. W. P. Mallett, sold to Hardy Morgan for
		$150, or $75 per acre; and No. 13 (the Chapel Hill Hotel lot) to
		Edmund Jones for $200, or $100 per acre. The two-acre lot
		adjoining the campus on the west, brought only $95, and that at the
		southwest corner of Franklin street and Columbia Avenue, was sold to James
		Paterson, the contractor for the East Building, for $122.</p>
          <p>Nearly all of these purchases were for speculative purposes and it is
		doubtful whether any money was made on the re-sales. Investors should take
		warning by these figures of the danger of holding unimproved land in towns of
		slow growth. Number 19 ($77), one of the most beautiful building sites
		in the village, the house on which, burnt in 1886, was the residence of
		Presidents Caldwell and Swain and which sheltered three Presidents of the
		United States, Polk, Buchanan, and Johnson, is now worth exclusive of buildings
		about $1,000. The $77 paid in 1793 at six per cent compound
		interest would be over $12,000, and until 1848 moneys lent were not
		taxed.</p>
          <p>It is noticeable, as showing the progress of prices in real estate, that
		the acre which is now the Presbyterian Manse, then without a building on it,
		was in 1847 bought by Prof. W. M. Green, since Bishop of Mississippi, for
		$37.50. In 1892 Prof. Collier Cobb gave for three-fourths of an acre
		adjoining $300.</p>
          <p>The first effort to start the University on its educational career was
		peculiar and proved abortive. On the 12th of December. 1792, the Curriculum
		Committee inserted an advertisement in the newspapers as follows:
		“Proposals from such gentlemen as may intend to undertake the instruction
		of youth” are invited, the instruction to embrace “Languages,
		particularly the English: the Belles Lettres: Logic and Moral Philosophy;
		Agriculture and Botany, with the principles of Architecture.”
		<pb xml:id="p48" n="48"/>No gentlemen offered themselves for this stupendous
		task.</p>

          <head>FIRST PLAN OF STUDIES AND BY-LAWS.</head>
          <p>On December 4, 1792, at a meeting of the Trustees at New Bern, Messrs.
		McCorckle, Stone, Moore, Ashe, and Hay were appointed a committee to report a
		plan of education, and Hugh Williamson was afterwards added. Of these McCorkle,
		Stone, Moore, and Ashe have already been described. Hay was an able lawyer from
		Fayetteville, from whom Haymount is called, occasionally a member of the
		General Assembly, a strong Federalist with a sharp tongue, which often
		embroiled him with the Republican judges, Ashe, Spencer and Williams. His
		beautiful daughter was the first wife of Judge Gaston. Dr. Hugh Williamson had
		the reputation of having much varied learning, especially in the sciences. He
		was a graduate of the Literary Department of the University of Pennsylvania,
		was educated to be a Presbyterian preacher, but after serving two years left
		the ministry on account of ill health. After being Professor of Mathematics in
		his alma mater for a short while he obtained the degree of Doctor of Medicine
		from the University of Edinburgh, and practiced his profession in Philadelphia.
		Engaging in a coasting commercial venture at the opening of the Revolutionary
		War, he was forced, in order to avoid capture, to run into Edenton, in North
		Carolina, and there concluded to settle. When the militia was called out for
		the unfortunate Camden campaign he volunteered his service as surgeon, and
		remained in the hands of the British in order to care for the American wounded.
		He was afterwards member of the North Carolina Legislature, member of the
		Congress of Confederation and of the Convention of 1787, and a signer of the
		United States Constitution. Marrying a lady of wealth living in New York, he
		removed his residence to that city and there wrote his History of North
		Carolina. He also published a volume on the climate of America as compared with
		that of Europe, and was an active co-operator in advancing the interests of the
		University of North Carolina until his death in 1819. Jefferson said of him
		that he was a “very useful member of the Congress of the
		Confederation.” of “acute mind and of a high degree of
		<pb xml:id="p49" n="49"/>erudition.” Of the committee the only college-bred
		men were McCorkle, Stone and Williamson.</p>
          <p>Dr. McCorkle, as Chairman, reported in December, 1792, in general terms
		that, considering the poverty of the University, the instruction in literature
		and science be confined to the study of the languages, particularly the
		English, the acquirement of historical knowledge, ancient and modern; Belles
		Lettres, Mathematics and Natural Philosophy; Botany and the theory and practice
		of Agriculture, best suited to the climate and soil of the State; the
		principles of Architecture. The committee recommended the procurement of
		apparatus for Experimental Philosophy and Astronomy. In this they included a
		set of Globes, a Barometer, Thermometer, Microscope, Telescope, Quadrant,
		Prismatic Glass, Air-pump, and an Electrical Machine. They were of the opinion
		that a library be procured, but the choice should be deferred until additional
		funds should be provided.</p>
          <p>The report is remarkable as being far ahead of the times.
		Notwithstanding that the chairman and the second on the list, Stone, were
		graduates of Princeton, a seat of the old curriculum, viz.: the Classics,
		Mathematics and Metaphysics, prominence is given to scientific studies and
		those of a practical nature. It is strikingly like the plan adopted by Congress
		for the establishment of the agricultural and mechanical colleges, in which, to
		use the words of the act, “Without excluding the classics, and including
		military tactics, shall be taught the branches of learning relating to
		Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts.” And I find that the course of
		studies, from which the classics were excluded, was called by the name adopted
		in 1870, the Scientific Course, although the Faculty adopting the latter had no
		knowledge of the scheme of 1792.</p>
          <p>It is certainly to the honor of Dr. McCorckle that, while he established
		over a hundred years ago in the wilds of North Carolina a Normal School, the
		first probably in America, he likewise drew up a scheme for the more practical
		instruction which all institutions of higher learning at the present day have
		to a greater or less extent adopted. It is probable, however, that as the
		University of Pennsylvania, the alma mater of Dr. Hugh Williamson, was
		conspicuous in exalting scientific studies, his <pb xml:id="p50" n="50"/>influence
		had weight in the report of the committee. I find that Dr. John Andrews,
		Provost of that institution, as late as 1810, writes that the principal
		teachers of Latin and English are not styled professors, but masters—that
		these schools were considered distinct from the college, subordinate to it and
		only kept up as nurseries of the philosophical classes. He thought that on the
		death or resignation of the Rev. Dr. Rogers, the head of the English school, it
		would be abolished altogether.</p>
          <p>On January 10, 1794, the Board ordered the scheme of the Committee to be
		carried into effect, and that the exercises should begin on the 15th of
		January, 1795. The annual Commencement was to be on the Monday after the 10th
		of July each year, after which “there should be a time of recreation or
		holiday of one month only.” The next vacation was to begin on the 15th of
		December and end on the 15th of January of each year.</p>
          <p>The prices for tuition were as follows:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>For Reading, Writing, Arithmetic and Bookkeeping, $8 per
		annum.</p>
            <p>For Latin, Greek, French, English Grammar, Geography, History and Belles
		Lettres, $12.50 per annum.</p>
            <p>Geometry with practical branches, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, Moral
		Philosophy, Chemistry and the principles of Agriculture, $15.00 per
		annum.</p>
          </q>
          <p>No President was to be chosen, but a Presiding Professor only, to occupy
		the President's house and to be responsible for all the teaching. His style was
		“Professor of Humanity,” his salary $300 a year and
		two-thirds of the tuition money.</p>
          <p>The Professor of Humanity and three Trustees, or the President of the
		Board, were authorized to employ assistance when needed. The salary of a tutor
		was to be $200, one-third of the tuition money, free board at Commons,
		and the use of a room in the “Old East.” The word
		“Humanity,” more often in the plural form, “the
		Humanities,” was held to include grammar, logic, rhetoric, poetry and the
		ancient classics, opposed to mathematics and the natural sciences.</p>
          <p>Charles Wilson Harris, a recent graduate of Princeton, was chosen, in
		the spring of 1795. Tutor of Mathematics.</p>
          <p>It was likewise resolved to build a Steward's House, to be
		<pb xml:id="p51" n="51"/>ready at the opening of the institution, the size of the
		edifice to be at the discretion of the Building Committee.</p>
          <p>The students were to be allowed, but not compelled, to live in the
		University building and board at Commons.</p>
          <p>Absalom Tatom, of Hillsborough, who was afterwards a Commoner from that
		borough and, by his criticism of the University as being aristocratical,
		provoked violent denunciation by President Caldwell, and Walter Alves, of the
		same town, the new Treasurer, were added to the Building Committee.</p>
          <p>A committee, composed of John Haywood, Davie, James Taylor, Adlai
		Osborne and Rev. Dr. McCorkle, reported that, as instructed, they had examined
		into the financial condition of the institution. That, “on the 1st of
		November, 1794, the institution would have in ready cash £6,297, 9s, 6d,
		($12,594.95), exclusive of the <hi rend="italics">hard</hi>money, which
		by that time for interest will be three hundred dollars, or thereabout. This
		interest was payable by the United States on bonds invested in the new debt
		created for discharging the Revolutionary obligations of the General and State
		governments.</p>
          <p>The Committee, to report “the quantity and quality of the meats
		and drinks to be furnished to students,” was composed of Col. Wm. Lenoir,
		David Stone, Joel Lane, Robert Porter and John Haywood. The diet recommended
		seems sufficiently generous.</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>For Breakfast.—Coffee and tea, or chocolate and tea, one warm
		roll, one loaf of wheat or corn flour (the secretary spells it flower), at the
		option of the student, with a sufficiency of butter.</p>
            <p>For Dinner.—A dish or cover of bacon and greens, or beef and
		turnips, together with a sufficient quantity of fresh meats, or fowls, or
		pudding and tarts, with a sufficiency of wheat and corn bread.</p>
            <p>For Supper.—Coffee, tea, or milk at the option of the Steward,
		with the necessary quantity of bread or biscuit.</p>
          </q>
          <p>The Committee adds that “it is expected Potatoes and all other
		kinds of vegetable food will be furnished, and plentifully, by the
		Steward,” with a clean table cloth every other day. “They are of
		opinion that no drink other than water be provided, the word
		“drink” here meaning spirituous, vinous or malt fluids.” The
		report was adopted.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p52" n="52"/>
          <p>It is manifest that there is abundant room for differences between the
		Steward and his hungry patrons. Neither the size, nor the weight of the rolls,
		loaves, bacon, beef, is specified. As no fresh meats and fowls were required
		when puddings and tarts were on hand, the first course, bacon with beans, or in
		lieu thereof, beef and turnips, must have been a trifle lonesome. And if the
		Steward, as he had the right to do, concluded to serve corn-bread, hot or cold,
		without butter, even the advocate of Spartan simplicity might find it unsavory.
		It must be noted too that the age and strength of the butter, which was not
		imperative except at breakfast, might be a matter of serious wrangling. It
		seems to have depended on the sympathetic temperament of the Steward whether
		the expectation of the unlimited supply of vegetables was realized in all
		seasons. Our history will show abundant heart-burnings resulting from the want
		of more stringent provisions in the summary of that officer's duties.</p>
          <p>In addition to furnishing food, the Board required the Steward to give
		the floors, passages and staircases a fortnightly washing, to have the
		students' rooms swept and beds made once a day, and to have brought from
		“the spring” at least four times a day a sufficient quantity of
		water in the judgment of the Faculty. The spring mentioned was near the
		Episcopal Church rear wall, the head of the streamlet going through Battle
		Park. It was then bold and pure. General Clingman informed me that it was used
		as late as 1831.</p>
          <p>The first Steward was John Taylor, usually called Buck Taylor. For his
		services he was to receive $30 a year for each student. He was required
		to enter into bond with good security in the sum of $400 for the
		performance of his duty. An inspection of a copy of the bond shows that the
		uncertainty in regard to the vegetables was partly removed by adding other
		words, so as to read “potatoes and all kinds of vegetable food usually
		served up in Carolina in sufficient quantities.” The hours of meals were
		for breakfast and dinner eight and one, and for supper “before or after
		candle light, at the discretion of the faculty.” The provision was added
		that if milk should be served at supper, neither coffee, tea, nor chocolate
		should be <pb xml:id="p53" n="53"/>required, “unless by boys who eat no
		milk.” Eating milk has an odd sound to our ear, but it must not be
		understood that the lacteal fluid hardened into the likeness of cheese. In
		1796, for some reason not explained, the requirement of milk was dispensed with
		until after July 1st, while wheat bread and biscuit might be lacking until the
		same date. The house of the Steward stood for fifty years at the crown of the
		hill east of Smith Hall, in the middle of Cameron Avenue—a two-storied
		wooden building painted white. Taylor held the contract until he gave place to
		Major Pleasant Henderson, a Revolutionary soldier, uncle of Chief Justice
		Leonard Henderson.</p>
          <p>John Taylor was a fine specimen of the bold, frank, rough, honest,
		Revolutionary veteran, a good citizen, but perhaps too ready to assert his
		rights and resent injuries by first law. He owned a plantation three miles west
		of Chapel Hill, now called the Snipes place. When he came to his death-bed he
		requested to be buried on the summit of a woody hill overlooking the cultivated
		fields, so that he could watch the negroes and keep them at their work. The
		monument is a sandstone slab, and on it, “To the Memory of John Taylor.
		Born June 22, 1747; died May 28, 1828. A Patriot of 1776.”</p>
          <p>At this meeting General Davie was requested to prepare a book-plate for
		the University books. It will be noticed that his Revolutionary title of
		Colonel is dropped for that of a higher rank, which of course was in the
		militia. There is a tradition that when he was afterwards a special
		Commissioner to France, Napoleon, although generally treating him with marked
		consideration, showed disgust when he learned that the title was not gained on
		the gory battlefield.</p>
          <p>The names of the earliest donors of books to the Library should be
		known. They were: Honorable Judge Williams, 3 volumes; James Reid, Esq., of
		Wilmington, 21 volumes; Wm. R. Davie, 6 volumes; Rev. David Ker, 3 volumes;
		Richard Bennehan, 32 volumes; Araham Hodge, 10 volumes; Centre Benevolent
		Society of Iredell, 11 volumes; Francis W. N. Burton, 2 volumes. In 1797 Joseph
		P. Gautier, Senator from Bladen, a lawyer, made the handsome gift of 174
		volumes of French books.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p54" n="54"/>
          <p>The Trustees placed in the hands of Hugh Williamson $200, to be
		used in the purchase of “such Grammar, Classical and other books as in
		his opinion will be first needed,” and the Professor of Humanity was
		directed to sell them to the students at cost. It is interesting to note the
		titles of some of these books and their prices:</p>

          <p>It will be observed that Dr. Williamson rightly estimated the paucity of
		numbers likely to be in the higher Greek classes. The prices also point to the
		general slender demand for both Latin and Greek: $2.50 for Xenophon,
		$3.75 for Homer, $2.25 for Cicero, Virgil, and Horace would
		distress the average student even in our day. Money was much more difficult of
		attainment then than now.</p>
          <p>The by-laws of the University were written at first by Dr. McCorkle,
		then referred to a committee, amended and adopted finally on the 6th of
		February, 1795. The following is a faithful summary.</p>
          <p>The duties of the President, or Presiding Professor, were to superintend
		all studies, particularly those of the Senior class, provide for the
		performance of the morning and evening prayer, to examine each student on every
		Sunday evening on questions previously given them on the general principles of
		morality and <pb xml:id="p55" n="55"/>religion; to deliver weekly lectures on the
		Principles of Agriculture, Botany, Zoology, Mineralogy, Architecture and
		Commerce; report annually at least to the Trustees on the state of the
		University, with such recommendations as he saw fit to suggest.</p>
          <p>The officers of the University collectively were called the Faculty,
		with power to inflict the punishments prescribed by the Trustees, and to make
		temporary regulations when the Board was not in session.</p>
          <p>No officer to be removed without a fair hearing.</p>
          <p>Four literary classes were prescribed, called First, Second, Third, and
		Fourth.</p>
          <p>The studies of the First Class were English Grammar, Roman Antiquities,
		and such parts of the Roman historians, orators and poets as the professors
		might designate, and also the Greek Testament.</p>
          <p>The Second Class to study Arithmetic, Bookkeeping, Geography, including
		the use of globes, Grecian antiquity and Greek classics.</p>
          <p>The exercises of the Third Class to be the Mathematics, including
		Geometry, Natural Philosophy and Astronomy.</p>
          <p>The Fourth Class to study Logic, Moral Philosophy, Principles of Civil
		Government, Chronology, History, Ancient and Modern, the Belles Lettres,
		“and the revisal of whatsoever may appear necessary to the officers of
		the University.”</p>
          <p>It was provided that if any studies should not be finished in one year,
		they should be completed in the next. <hi rend="italics">E converso,</hi>if
		those assigned to one year should be finished before the end of the session,
		those of the next should be anticipated.</p>
          <p>For admission into the First, <hi rend="italics">i. e.,</hi>the lowest
		class, successful examinations should be had on Cæsar's Commentaries,
		Sallust, Ovid or Virgil and the Greek Grammar. Equivalent Latin works were
		accepted.</p>
          <p>Those electing to study the Sciences and the English language to be
		formed into a Scientific class, or pursue the chosen subjects with the Literary
		classes.</p>
          <p>Those entering the Third class at, or after, the middle stage of its
		progress, should pay eight dollars; those entering the Fourth in its first
		half, $12.50; in the second half, $15.00.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p56" n="56"/>
          <p>Three quarterly and a final examination were required of each class.</p>
          <p>Attendance on prayers twice a day was required, and morning prayer was
		at sunrise.</p>
          <p>From morning prayer to breakfast was to be study hour. One hour was
		allowed for breakfast and amusement, after which three hours were devoted to
		study and recitation, <hi rend="italics">i. e.,</hi>until 12 o'clock.</p>
          <p>Study hours began again at 2 o'clock p. m. and continued until prayers
		at 5 o'clock, after which was a “vacation” until 8 p. m.,
		“when the students shall return to their lodgings and not leave them
		until prayers the next morning.”</p>
          <p>Each class to have one of its members a monitor to report those absent
		without leave, and also the disorderly and vicious.</p>
          <p>Students all to speak, read and exhibit compositions on Saturday
		mornings. Saturday afternoons were allowed for amusements.</p>
          <p>All were required to attend divine service on the Sabbath. In the
		afternoon they were examined on the general principles of religion and
		morality. They were enjoined to reverence the Sabbath, to use no profane
		language, not to speak disrespectfully of religion or of any religious
		denomination. Keeping ardent spirits in their rooms, association with evil
		company, playing at any game of hazard, or other kind of gaming and betting,
		were prohibited. They must treat their teachers with respect. And an
		aristocratic principle was introduced when it was further ordered that they
		treat “each other according to the honor due each class.” A general
		injunction to observe the rules of decency and cleanliness was prescribed.</p>
          <p>A fee of $5.00 per term, payable half yearly in advance, was
		exacted for room rent and repairs of accidental damages. One causing wilful
		damage must pay four-fold. If the mischief-maker was unknown, the real damage
		was assessed on all the students. Payment of dues was necessary to obtaining
		degrees.</p>
          <p>The students were required to cleanse their beds and rooms of bugs every
		two weeks.</p>
          <p>To ensure understanding of the rules it was ordered that the students
		copy them in note books.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p57" n="57"/>
          <p>With regard to punishment the by-laws were framed with conscious
		recognition of the fact that University life is separate and apart from that of
		the State. A “Declaration of Rights” was prefixed. “The
		students charged shall have timely notice and testimony taken on the most
		solemn assurance shall be deemed valid without calling on a magistrate to
		administer an oath in legal form.”</p>
          <p>The grades of punishment were:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>1. Admonition by any University officer, or by the Faculty.</item>
            <item>2. Admonition before the whole University.</item>
            <item>3. Admonition before the Trustees.</item>
            <item>4. Suspension.</item>
            <item>5. Total and final expulsion.</item>
          </list>
          <p>It was gravely provided that no pecuniary mulcts should be inflicted for
		non-attendance on prayers or recitations, but in addition to admonition, an
		abstract of the report of the monitors of such absence must be sent to the
		offender's parent or guardian.</p>
          <p>The “monitors' bills,” or reports, were to be read publicly
		every Monday evening, and offenders “brought to account.”</p>
          <p>The laws were to be publicly read once a year, and an address delivered
		on the advantage and necessity of observing the laws. This address was to be
		either by a member of the Faculty, or by a student appointed for the
		purpose.</p>
          <p>A hundred years' experience discloses a marked change not only in words,
		but in the spirit of the University laws.</p>
          <p>In the administration of the criminal law a regular trial of offenders
		was originally contemplated. Witnesses were called for and against the accused,
		their solemn affirmation being taken as an oath. In practice it was found of
		course that students could not be compelled to inform on one another. Now the
		practice is to have no witnesses at all. The executive officer satisfies
		himself that there is strong presumption of guilt, so strong, that if the
		accused refuses to answer, this refusal is to be considered as confession. If
		the accused positively affirms certain facts, they are, as a rule, accepted
		without calling any witnesses. His denial, unless inconsistent with known
		facts, is admitted to be true. It is not a criminal trial at all, but the
		<pb xml:id="p58" n="58"/>accused is allowed to exculpate himself from suspicion, so
		grave, that without such exculpation, guilt is conclusively presumed. The
		executive officer never arraigns a supposed offender on a mere suspicion or
		guess, with the intention of calling up one after another until the offender is
		discovered. This would ruin his authority and would justify students in
		refusing to answer, because obviously the plan would be equivalent to making
		students indirectly inform on one another. After much disturbance and many
		clashes this is the final outcome—the evolution of University trials. It
		is more satisfactory than any preceding method. A practice of many years has
		shown not one serious mistake on the part of the executive officer, and
		extremely rare cases of deception on the part of the accused. In these the
		scorn of their fellows was sufficient punishment.</p>
          <p>It is occasionally urged that the Faculty should invoke the power of the
		courts for punishment of student offenders. It has been done once at least, and
		threatened oftener in old times, but it seems to be against principle. The
		Faculty stand <hi rend="italics">in loco parentis,</hi>and ought except in
		extreme cases rather to employ counsel to defend their children “in
		law” than prosecute them.</p>
          <p>The evolution of punishments is interesting.</p>
          <p>Up to a recent period admonition before the Faculty was practiced
		freely. Experience has shown that this created irritation without effecting
		reformation, and it has been discontinued. The President takes the duty.</p>
          <p>Admonition before the whole University has been long ago abandoned as
		mischievous and useless. The same may be said of admonition before the
		Trustees. Suspension for from two weeks to six months was practiced until 1868.
		Obviously this punishment was very injurious to the scholarship of the student.
		It was not dreaded to a great extent by those who were not in awe of parents.
		Often the offenders engaged board a few miles from Chapel Hill and had a jolly
		time “rusticating,” reading novels, hunting or fishing. Sometimes
		they plunged into the dissipations of neighboring towns. So the “total
		and final expulsion” was divided into “dismission,” and
		“expulsion,” the latter being only inflicted in cases of flagrant
		enormity. <pb xml:id="p59" n="59"/>For offenses for which formerly suspension for a
		definite term was inflicted, the punishment is now dismission from the
		University without report to the Trustees. It then rests entirely with the
		Faculty whether the offender shall be allowed to return, and if so, when and on
		what conditions. If the offence is an atrocious one the case is reported to the
		Trustees and, in addition to dismission, expulsion is recommended. If the
		Trustees concur, on no terms can there be re-admission. A milder form of
		dismission is a notification to the offender that he must withdraw, or a
		request to the parents to order him home. This allows easier admission to other
		institutions. Sometimes offences are overlooked in consideration of pledges to
		refrain from the particular misconduct. General pledges of good conduct, once a
		favorite with the Faculty, are now not required, as being a snare for the
		thoughtless.</p>
          <p>If it should become absolutely necessary, the Presiding Professor, with
		the advice of three Trustees, could employ a teacher of reading, writing,
		arithmetic, and bookkeeping.</p>
          <p>The Trustees had a high conception of the office of President. Before
		going into the election of the Professor of Humanity, it was ordered that
		neither he nor any assistant shall have “any manner of claim, right or
		preference whatever to the Presidency of the University, nor to such
		employments as it may hereafter be thought advisable to fill, but they shall be
		considered as standing in the same situation as though they had received no
		appointment from the Board.”</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>ELECTION OF PRESIDING PROFESSOR.</head>
          <p>The election was by ballot on the 10th of January, 1794. It does not
		appear that there were any applicants, but the following were placed in
		nomination: Rev. John Brown, who had been a pupil of Dr. McCorkle, pastor of
		Waxhaw Church, afterwards a Professor in the University of South Carolina, and
		President of that of Georgia; Rev. Robert Archibald, a graduate of Princeton,
		pastor of Rocky River Church, afterwards embracing the doctrine of universal
		salvation, but it did not save him from being dropped from the Presbyterian
		roll; Rev. James Tate, an excellent Presbyterian divine from New Hanover; Rev.
		George Micklejohn, generally called Parson <pb xml:id="p60" n="60"/>Micklejohn, who
		had been a minister of the Church of England in Colonial times, having under
		his jurisdiction, besides many others, the New Hope Chapel. He was a Tory and
		was forced to change his residence to the Albemarle country for fear of his
		influence over the Regulators. He was a rough, honest gentleman of the old
		Scotch school, according to tradition, who would hire a man to attend his
		services by the bribe of a generous drink out of his bottle of brandy. Many
		surmised that the choice would fall on Dr. McCorkle, a Trustee, who delivered
		the address at the laying of the corner-stone of the Old East; but, while his
		learning was conceded, Davie distrusted his executive ability. A story of
		McCorkle as a farmer shows that this distrust was well founded. He was used to
		carry into the field volumes on theological subjects for his diversion in
		intervals of manual labor. A neighbor seeking him on business found him
		stretched <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">sub tegmine
		querci</foreign>,</hi>deep in his studies, while his negro plowman was fast
		asleep under another tree, and the mule was cropping the grateful
		corn-tops.</p>
          <p>In a letter of Davie's, written at a later period, is the suggestion of
		another objection to Dr. McCorkle, by reason of a distrust of the wisdom of all
		preachers. Speaking of some criticisms of the University, he wrote,
		“Bishop Pettigrew has said it is a very dissipated and debauched place.
		Some priests have also been doing us the same good office to the westward.
		Nothing, it seems, goes well that these <hi rend="italics">men of God</hi>(the
		italics are his) have not some hand in.” Dr. McCorkle must have been
		included in this sneer. Davie, in truth, had imbibed some of the skepticism
		then so prevalent among the educated classes.</p>
          <p>Although he was not chosen, the good Doctor had no resentment against
		the University. This is proved by his collection of a subscription from his
		congregation at Thyatira for the use of the University, the only instance of
		congregational help given in the early days. Whether a business man or not he
		was possessed in a large measure of piety and force. Born August 23, 1746, in
		Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, he was brought to North Carolina when nine
		years of age to a farm fifteen miles west of Salisbury. He was a bright student
		at the school of Dr. David Caldwell, graduated at Princeton in 1772 in the
		class of Aaron Burr, whose father of the same name 
		<figure><graphic xml:id="ill1" url="bat1-060.jpg"/><p>OLD EAST BUILDING.</p><p>(Drawn by John Pettigrew, a student 1797.)</p><p>OLD EAST BUILDING.</p></figure><pb xml:id="p61" n="61"/>was President of the College. After his
		ordination as a minister of the Presbyterian Church he was for awhile a
		missionary in the counties of Hanover and Orange in Virginia. He then settled
		at Thyatira, near his father's homestead in Rowan County, in North Carolina,
		and connected himself with the Presbytery of Orange. In 1785 he established his
		school. His person is described as tall and manly, his delivery in the pulpit
		grave and solemn, his language impressive and thrilling. He lived until January
		21, 1811, on his death-bed dictating minute directions as to his funeral. His
		wife was Elizabeth, daughter of William Steele, a sister of General John
		Steele, a prominent Congressman of his day.</p>
          <p>Of Andrew Martin, also nominated, I have been able to learn nothing.
		Possibly he was a relative of the Governor.</p>
          <p>Over these nominees Rev. David Ker, thirty-six years old, born in North
		Ireland and educated at Trinity College, Dublin, a recent immigrant,
		Presbyterian pastor in Fayetteville, adding to his small salary by conducting
		the high school in the town, was chosen to inaugurate the new institution.</p>
          <p>In order to be ready for the opening on the 15th of January, 1795, the
		work on the East Building and the President's house was ordered to be pushed.
		The contractor was Samuel Hopkins, as Martin Hall was the builder of Steward
		Hall, and Phileman Hodges of the Old Chapel, or Person Hall. It may be of
		interest to some that George Daniel made 150,000 bricks for $266.67 at
		one time and at another for $333.30. In the same year John Hogan
		received $400 for the same work. The clay and the fuel for burning were
		from the University lands. It certainly shows a striking difference between old
		ways and new that the lime for mortar was obtained from shells brought up the
		Cape Fear to Fayetteville and thence hauled by wagons to be burned in Chapel
		Hill. Now, instead of from the ocean which breaks upon our coast, we get our
		lime from the far-distant State of Maine.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE OPENING OF THE UNIVERSITY, JANUARY 15, 1795.</head>
          <p>The opening of the University on the memorable January 15, 1795, gave no
		prophecy of the swarms of students annually appearing at the openings of our
		day. The winter was severe and <pb xml:id="p62" n="62"/>the roads almost
		impassable. Governor Richard Dobbs Spaight, whose energy and devotion to duty
		had been shown when, as a student of twenty, he hastened to sail for America,
		ran the hazard of being captured by British vessels in order to throw in his
		fortunes with his native State, had braved the discomforts of twenty-eight
		miles of red mud and pipe clay and jagged rocks stretching from Chapel Hill to
		Raleigh. It is recorded that he had attendants, and we can assuredly guess that
		among them were State Treasurer John Haywood, and John Craven, the Comptroller,
		the first University Treasurer. The gazette of the period, the
		<hi rend="italics">North Carolina Journal,</hi>merely states that there were
		present “several members of the corporation and many other gentlemen,
		members of the General Assembly,” then in session. We may almost
		certainly see in attendance the members from Hillsborough and Orange, Samuel
		Benton, father of the great Senator, “Old Bullion,” Thomas Hart
		Benton; Walter Alves, son of James Hogg; and William Lytle, son of Colonel
		Archibald Lytle who fought so bravely under Sumner at Eutaw; also William Cain,
		the Senator from Orange, whose liberality to the institution has been
		mentioned; William Person Little, Senator from Granville, and Thomas Person,
		Commoner, both nephews of the University's benefactor, detained at home by the
		infirmities of age; John Baptist Ashe, Commoner from Halifax, afterwards
		elected Governor but dying before taking his seat, in place of General Davie
		then employed on official duty elsewhere. Of course the ever-active Joel Lane,
		Senator from Wake, who offered broad acres to secure the University at Cary,
		was on hand. And it is reasonably certain, judging from the interest they took
		in the new institution, that John Macon, Senator from Warren, Daniel Gillespie,
		Senator from Guilford, whose son was afterwards Presiding Professor; and the
		brilliant young Commoner from Fayetteville, afterwards the first Chief Justice
		of our Supreme Court, John Louis Taylor, were willing to add eclat to the
		occasion by their presence. Of course in attendance were Alexander Mebane, the
		Congressman, and James Hogg, the rich merchant, Trustees, Commissioners to
		select the site, and members of the Building Committee.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p63" n="63"/>
          <p>The morning of the 15th of January opened with a cold, drizzling rain.
		As the sighing of the watery wind whistled through the leafless branches of
		tall oaks and hickories and the Davie poplar then in vigorous youth, all that
		met the eyes of the distinguished visitors were a two-storied brick building,
		the unpainted wooden house of the Presiding Professor, the avenue between them
		filled with stumps of recently felled trees, a pile of yellowish red clay, dug
		out for the foundation of the Chapel, or Person Hall, a pile of lumber
		collected for building Steward's Hall, a Scotch-Irish preacher-professor, in
		whose mind were fermenting ideas of infidelity, destined soon to cost him his
		place, <hi rend="italics">and not one student.</hi></p>
          <p>The proverbial optimism of the press as to matters hoped for did not
		fail the ancestor of our modern newspapers. The editor of the
		<hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>kindly comments: “The Governor, with the
		Trustees who accompanied him, viewed the buildings and made report to the
		Board, by which they are enabled to inform the public that the buildings
		prepared for the reception and accommodation of students are in part finished,
		and that youth disposed to enter the University may come forward with the
		assurance of being received.” The editor goes on to state the terms of
		tuition and board in apparently naive unconsciousness that he was giving the
		University a first-class advertisement. When I state that this important item
		appears in the issue of February 23d, forty-nine days after the event, we must
		give the palm for furnishing news more promptly, if not more reliably, to the
		modern reporter.</p>
          <p>The learned Presiding Professor, Dr. David Ker, reigned in his solitary
		greatness for the greater part of the period of revolution of the wintry moon.
		It was not until the 12th of February that the first student arrived, with no
		companion, all the way from the banks of the lower Cape Fear, the precursor of
		a long line of seekers after knowledge. His residence was Wilmington, his name
		Hinton James.</p>
          <p>For two weeks, in his loneliness, he constituted the entire student body
		of the University, with no Sophomores saluting his ears with diabolical yells,
		nor teaching him to keep step to the rhythm of whistling music. For two weeks
		he was the first-honor man of his class.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p64" n="64"/>
          <p>It was of good omen that this first-fruit of the University was worthy
		to head the list of her students. The Faculty records show that he performed
		his duties faithfully and with ability. For several years the students were
		required to read original compositions on Saturdays, and those deemed
		especially meritorious were posted in a record book. The name of Hinton James
		occurs often on this Roll of Honor. His taste took a scientific and practical
		direction. One of his subjects was “The Uses of the Sun,” another
		“The Motions of the Earth,” a third “The Commerce of
		Britain,” a fourth “The Slave Trade,” a fifth “The
		Pleasures of College Life,” and a sixth the “Effects of Climate on
		the Minds and Bodies of Men.”</p>
          <p>After leaving the University, James became a civil engineer of
		usefulness in his section of the State, as an assistant to Chief Engineer
		Fulton, who was brought from Scotland at a salary of $6,000 a year
		payable in gold, to improve the navigation of our rivers. In passing from
		Wilmington down the beautiful Cape Fear, I was shown by my intelligent friend,
		the late Henry Nutt, some of James' works for deepening the channel, which had
		withstood the floods and tides of sixty years. He was likewise called into the
		service of his country as a legislator for three terms, beginning with 1807,
		for two of them being the colleague of a lawyer of great reputation in the old
		days, William Watts Jones.</p>
          <p>The next arrivals were, a fortnight later, Maurice and Alfred Moore of
		Brunswick, and their cousin, Richard Eagles, of New Hanover; John Taylor of
		Orange, and from Granville William M. Sneed, and three sons of Robert H.
		Burton, the Treasurer of the University, namely, Hutchins G., Francis and
		Robert H. Burton, Junior. It is pleasant to record that all of these turned out
		to be good men. The two Moores were sons of Judge Alfred Moore. Maurice served
		Brunswick County in the General Assembly and then became a planter in
		<choice><sic>Lousiana</sic><corr>Louisiana</corr></choice>. He it was who had the misfortune to shoot
		Governor Benjamin Smith in a duel. Alfred Moore, whose bust may be seen in
		Gerrard Hall, was a cultivated and popular man, reaching the dignity, once
		considered as nearly equal to that of Governor, of the Speakership of the House
		of Commons. He would have gone higher, if he had not lacked ambition. His name
		and <pb xml:id="p65" n="65"/>talents have descended to his scholarly grandson,
		Alfred Moore Waddell. The father of Richard Eagles gave the name to Eagles
		Island, opposite Wilmington. The son, like the father, was a man of wealth and
		high standing in a cultivated community. John Taylor, son of the first steward
		of the University, was for many years Clerk of the Superior Court of Orange and
		was the grandfather of our big-brained mathematician—the late Ralph H.
		Graves. Of the Granville men, William Morgan Sneed was seven times State
		Senator and twice Commoner. Of the three Burtons, Hutchins G. was thrice
		elected Governor of the State, after being a Congressman. Francis Nash Williams
		Burton was a lawyer of large practice in Lincoln and the adjoining counties,
		while Robert, his partner, was at one time Judge of the Superior Court. A
		daughter of Judge Burton married the eminent lawyer, Michael Hoke, and was the
		mother of one of General Lee's best Major-Generals, Robert F. Hoke, and
		grandmother of Secretary Hoke Smith. I give these particulars in order to show
		that the University made a good start on its grand career. Its earliest sons
		were leaders in good works.</p>
          <p>The numbers reached forty-one by the end of the term. During the second
		term they rose to nearly one hundred, but such was the dearth of good schools
		in the State that at least one-half of them were unprepared to enter the
		University classes.</p>
          <p>It became necessary to inaugurate a Preparatory Department, or
		“Grammar School,” for the benefit of these juveniles, many of them
		belonging to the “small-boy” genus. The profession of teachers was
		then, and years afterward, at such a low ebb that obtaining competent
		professors was a most troublesome problem.</p>
          <p>Among the earliest students besides those I have named we find men
		afterwards notable for good works: such, for example, as Ebenezer Pettigrew, a
		member of Congress, father of General J. Johnston Pettigrew, a still more
		eminent son of the University; Thomas D. Bennehan, famed for bounteous
		hospitality, long a Trustee of the institution, which his father, Richard
		Bennehan, assisted in its young days; James Mebane, Speaker of the House of
		Commons, father of another University <choice><sic>gradute</sic><corr>graduate</corr></choice>
		<pb xml:id="p66" n="66"/>and Speaker of the Senate, Giles Mebane. I could name many
		others.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>HARRIS ELECTED.</head>
          <p>The increase in numbers led to the election of a Tutor of Mathematics,
		in the <choice><sic>sphing</sic><corr>spring</corr></choice>of 1795. The choice fell on Charles
		Wilson Harris, a recent first-honor graduate of Princeton, nephew of Dr.
		Charles Harris, a noted physician of his day, who taught at his home probably
		the first medical school in the State. Young Harris had a strong mind, elegant
		literary tastes, courtly manners, and weight of character. These two, Ker and
		Harris, sustained the burdens of instruction and discipline during the first
		year of University life, and sustained it with conspicuous
		<choice><sic>fathfulness</sic><corr>faithfulness</corr></choice>and ability. It was a great
		misfortune that Ker the next year went off into infidelity and wild democracy,
		thus raising up two sets of enemies in the Board of Trustees, Christians and
		Federalists, so that he deemed it prudent after eighteen months to resign his
		charge.</p>
          <p>For the first year and a half, however, these two, Ker and Harris, had
		the difficult and unpleasant task of classifying and instructing the
		unorganized mass of all ages from mature young men to mere boys, some with a
		smattering of algebra and the classics, others innocent even of arithmetic and
		grammar.</p>
          <p>We have no letters of Dr. Ker written from Chapel Hill, but by the
		kindness of William Shakespeare Harris and other relatives this want is
		abundantly supplied by those of his associate. Charles W. Harris was an elegant
		writer. His style is free from ostentation, his ideas are clearly and strongly
		expressed, his penmanship is good, and his spelling in advance of his age as a
		rule. It is strange, however, that he gives to Chapel in Chapel Hill two p's
		instead of one.</p>
          <p>On the 10th of April Harris writes to his uncle, Dr. Charles Harris:
		“We have begun to introduce by degrees the regulations of the University
		and as yet have not been disappointed. There is one class in Natural Philosophy
		and four in the languages.” He continues, “The constitution of this
		college is on a more liberal plan than that of any other in America, and by the
		amendment, which I think it will receive at the next meeting of the Trustees,
		its usefulness will probably be much promoted. <pb xml:id="p67" n="67"/>The notion
		that true learning consists rather in exercising the reasoning faculties and
		laying up a store of useful knowledge, than in overloading the memory with
		words of dead languages, is daily becoming more prevalent.” He then
		enters upon praises of Miss Wollstonecraft's book on the “Rights of
		Women,” as containing the true principles of education, and states that
		though the laws at present require that Latin and Greek be understood by a
		graduate, they will in all probability be mitigated in their effect.</p>
          <p>He was of a social nature, and deplored the lack of congenial society.
		“My only resort,” he wrote, “is to Mr. Ker, who makes ample
		amends to me for the want of any other. He is a violent republican and is
		continually deprecating the <choice><sic>aristocical</sic><corr>aristocratic[?]</corr></choice>
		principles which have lately prevailed much in our executive.” We can see
		that Harris' political faith was swerved by this well-educated, able and
		experienced middle-aged clerical politician, for he sneers at some strong words
		of praise of Washington by one Rev. Stanhope Smith, saying that “tho' he
		be the greatest man in America the encomium smells strong of British
		seasoning.”</p>
          <p>He rejoiced that the Trustees resolved to inaugurate a museum and took
		active steps to procure for it specimens.</p>
          <p>Although the articles given have been lost, the names of the donors
		should be remembered and the objects given recorded. The context shows that
		some of the specimens were given three years later.</p>

          <p>As Harris had read some medical books while living with Dr. Harris, and,
		as there was no physician nearer to Chapel Hill than Hillsboro, he charitably
		kept a small stock of medicine for the students and the neighborhood, to be
		sold at cost. He <hi rend="italics">sent</hi>a plot of the University lands,
		well drawn, with a broad avenue leading N. 69 E. from the contemplated Main
		(now South) Building to “point-prospect” (now Piney Prospect). The
		campus then contained 98¾ acres; about twice as large as the present
		campus. His opinion of the suitableness of the locality for its purpose,
		accords with Davie's—“Most happily situated; a delightful prospect,
		charming groves, medicinal springs, light and wholesome air, and inaccessible
		to vice.” “This last <choice><sic>enconium</sic><corr>encomium</corr></choice>by Mr.
		Charles Pettigrew, the Bishop-elect from Edenton, added when he visited
		us.” The inaccessibility to vice was a pleasing delusion, as the good Dr.
		Pettigrew found on a subsequent visit. Two years afterwards he writes to
		Caldwell of his dread lest his sons, John and Ebenezer, may have “all
		fear of the Almighty eradicated from their minds by the habitual use of oaths
		and imprecations, which report says, and which my own ears have informed me,
		are too common impletives
		<ref xml:id="ref2" target="#n2">*</ref>
		<note xml:id="n2" anchored="true" target="#ref2">	  * This word is not in Webster.</note>in the conversation of the
		students.” Those conversant with the social history of the times know
		well that the students used no worse language than was common in all social
		gatherings of men. </p>
          <p><choice><sic>Harriss</sic><corr>Harris</corr></choice>expressed much concern about the
		education of his younger brother, Robert. “He is growing fast and
		receiving none of those improvements which he ought. I could not prevail with
		my father to let him come to this place.—It can scarcely be pecuniary
		want that hinders his complying with my request. Nor can it be I hope any
		distrust of my principles, as I have heard suggested. He and I have been very
		free in speaking on tenets, and I never observed any great degree of
		disapprobation. If the latter be the cause I have no more to say.”</p>
          <p>There is only one other allusion in all his letters to the deviation of
		his faith from that of his Presbyterian forefathers. That looked only to the
		denial of the doctrine of the Trinity <pb xml:id="p69" n="69"/>as usually
		understood, not by any means atheism, or denials of other truths of
		Christianity. If his apostasy had been rank, his Ruling Elder father would have
		regarded it not only with disapprobation, but horror. Nor would that father
		have placed his peculiarly beloved son, as within a few weeks he did, under the
		charge of an infidel elder brother, all the more dangerous because of his
		winning manners, strong mind and wide and varied reading. I think it is clear
		that Charles Harris' unbelief would in our day be regarded as not more
		heterodox than that preached by Dr. C. H. Briggs, Dr. Wm. Robertson Smith and
		other able divines, who have a large following in their respective churches,
		although regarded by the majority as lacking the true faith. In other words, he
		was like those called among Episcopalians, “Broad Churchmen.” It
		must be remembered that a hundred years ago there was much greater intolerance
		of differences of opinion than now.</p>
          <p>The first public examination was held on the 13th of July, 1795, the
		first of the long series of Commencements, which have produced more eloquence,
		brought together more distinguished men and beautiful women, provided a more
		abundant supply of unadulterated fun, and married off more congenial couples
		than any other similar occasion, in the land. Previous notice was given in the
		newspapers, over the signature of the Governor, Richard Dobbs Spaight. In an
		enthusiastic editorial in the <hi rend="italics">North Carolina Journal,</hi>
		it was stated that the “young gentlemen” had submitted with a
		degree of cheerfulness and promptitude to the regulations of the University,
		which does them the greatest honor.—The Commons have exceeded the
		expectations both of students and of strangers. The spirit of improvement,
		order and harmony, which reigns in this little community, emulously engaged in
		the noble work of cultivating the human mind, is most commendable.” The
		editor at the same time gives glowing praises of the Academies of Thyatira,
		under Dr. McCorkle, the Warrenton, under Rev. Marcus George, the Chatham under
		Rev. Wm. Bingham, and the New Bern, under Dr. T. P. Irving, as capable of
		furnishing students to the University.</p>
          <p>There is no contemporary account of this first Commencement,
		<pb xml:id="p70" n="70"/>but the deficiency is partly supplied by a letter from
		Hinton James, heretofore mentioned, written when he was about sixty years old.
		The public interest had not been aroused sufficiently to ensure a large
		attendance of visitors. Only one lady graced the occasion, the wife of the
		Governor, the first of the long procession of the thousands of the brightest
		and best of the womanhood of the land,—Mary (Leach) Spaight, well
		remembered as one of the most handsome and attractive of her sex.</p>
          <p>There were only about a dozen of the gentlemen of the State, the leaders
		of the hosts of the friends of higher education. Among them were “the
		University Father,” General Davie, and the Secretary of State, James
		Glasgow, whose frauds in his office had not been discovered; the merchant,
		James Hogg, and the eminent Attorney-General and Judge, Alfred Moore, the
		elder. These Trustees attended in pursuance of an ordinance of the Board that
		at every examination it should be the duty of one Trustee from each judicial
		district in alphabetical order to visit the classes and report the result of
		their inspection to the Board. As might have been expected, the attendance of
		the Trustees, at all times spasmodic, soon ceased altogether.</p>
          <p>It must have been an occasion of a staid and dignified nature, with no
		regaliad marshals, or dancing, or other amusements, to attract the fancy of
		young people.</p>
          <p>Oral examinations in the class-rooms and declamations and reading of
		compositions in one of the East Building rooms, fitted up for a public hall, in
		the presence of elderly gentlemen and Mrs. Spaight and probably Mrs. Mary Ker,
		the wife of the Presiding Professor, constituted the exercises.</p>
          <p>We have a letter from Davie written a few days afterwards, in which he
		says that the students acquitted themselves well, but with the refrigerating
		addition, “everything considered.” The Trustees were disgusted with
		the exorbitant charges of the contractors, Patterson of Chatham and Hopkins,
		for extra work; in Davie's opinion four times what they ought to have been.
		There is abundant evidence all through the early records of the watchful
		economy of the guardians of the interests of the University.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p71" n="71"/>
          <p>The letter was addressed to Treasurer John Haywood, who was absent from
		the meeting on account of the death of his first wife. It is interesting to see
		what kind of consolation the free-thinker, Davie, offers to one afflicted.
		“I regret exceedingly the various causes which produced your absence from
		the Board. However, as the Arabs say, ‘God would have it so and men must
		submit.’ Under misfortunes like yours there is no comfort because nothing
		can be substituted. The only recourse of the human mind in such cases is in a
		kind of philosophic fortitude, the calm result of time, reason and
		reflection.” Contrast this with the Christian's consolation,
		“Sorrow not as they who have no hope.”</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>GRAMMAR SCHOOL.</head>
          <p>On this occasion the Board determined to erect a house for a Grammar
		School, which should contain three or four lodging rooms, and thus relieve the
		congested state of the dwellers in the Old East Building. It would also
		separate from the older the very young students, some of whom were of such
		tender years, though tough in conscience, that it was necessary for their
		benefit to introduce corporal punishment. This school building was situated in
		the woods, south of Rosemary Street and west of the late public school, a place
		peculiarly lonely, but near two never-failing springs of purest water.</p>
          <p>Richard Sims, an advanced student from Warren County, seems to have been
		the first master of the Grammar School. In the month of December, 1796, was
		chosen Nicholas Delvaux, and with him on account of the rapid increase of
		numbers, was associated Samuel Allen Holmes, who had been a preacher. The
		antecedents of both of these teachers are unknown. Soon afterwards Holmes was
		promoted to the University and William Richards, late a teacher in the Academy
		of Mr. Marcus George in Warrenton, was placed in the Grammar School in his
		stead.</p>
          <p>It has been mentioned that those of the early students who wrote the
		best compositions were rewarded by having their names posted on an honor roll.
		The first who won this distinction was in August, 1795, Richard Sims, of
		Warrenton, <pb xml:id="p72" n="72"/>his theme being “The Employment of
		Time.” The second was Thomas A. Osborne on Habit. The third was Thomas A.
		Osborne on the question, “Do Savage or Civilized Nations Enjoy the Most
		Happiness.” The fourth Edwin Jay Osborne on “The Uses of
		Geometry.” The fifth by Edwin Jay Osborne on “Self
		Government.” He divided honors in the sixth with Hinton James, the themes
		respectively being, “The Uses of the Passions” and “The Uses
		of the Sun.” In the next week the same Osborne and Henry Kearney were the
		first, on “The Distinction Between Resentment and Revenge,” by the
		former, and “The Uses of the Moon,” by the latter. This honor roll
		was discontinued after the first year.</p>

          <head>THE LITERARY SOCIETIES.</head>
          <p>The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies have been such a large part of
		our university life that I must give their origin.</p>
          <p>It was doubtless through the influence of Tutor Harris, who had seen the
		benefits of the renowned Whig Society of Princeton, of which he was a member,
		that the first literary society of the University was formed, as his name is
		the first on the list of signers to the preliminary articles. It was organized
		on the 3d day of June, 1795, under the name of “The Debating
		Society.” The first President was James Mebane, of Orange, afterwards of
		Caswell; the first Clerk or Secretary was John Taylor, of Orange; the first
		Treasurer was Lawrence Toole, who changed his name to Henry Irwin Toole, of
		Edgecombe, grandfather of Bishop Joseph B. Cheshire; the first Censor Morum,
		Richard Sims, of Warren, afterwards Principal of the Grammar School.</p>
          <p>The objects of the society were expressed to be the cultivation of a
		lasting friendship and the promotion of useful knowledge. The members pledged
		themselves under hands and seals to obedience to the laws of the society and
		due performance of the regular exercises. I give the names of those fathers of
		the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies.</p>

          </p>
          <p>There was no constitution <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">eo
		nomine</foreign>,</hi>but there were “Laws and Regulations,” some
		of which are worthy of mention. The officers were a President, Censor Morum,
		two Correctors, a Clerk, and Treasurer. The President and Treasurer held
		<choice><sic>offie</sic><corr>office</corr></choice>for three weeks, the other officers for six
		weeks.</p>
          <p>The Censor Morum was clothed with powers and duties which would not be
		tolerated in this generation, “to inspect the conduct and morals of the
		members and report to the society those who preserve inattention to the studies
		of the University, in neglect of their duties as members, or in acting in such
		a manner as to reflect disgrace on their fellow-members.” This making the
		society responsible for attention to University exercises has been long ago
		abandoned, after the effort came near breaking it into fragments. This powerful
		officer, evidently modelled after the august Censors of Rome, presided in the
		absence of the President.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p74" n="74"/>
          <p>The society met on Thursday evenings only. The members were divided into
		three classes. These read, spoke and composed alternately. There was a debate
		at each session, two opposing members previously appointed opening, and then
		the other members had a right to discuss the question, but were not compelled
		to do so.</p>
          <p>It was the duty of each member of the class whose turn it was to
		“read” to hand in a “query,” then called “subject
		of debate,” and out of these one was chosen for the next meeting by the
		society.</p>
          <p>It must be noticed that the “reading” mentioned above meant
		the reading aloud of an extract from some author. Of the other two classes one
		declaimed memorized extracts, and the other read aloud short essays of their
		own composition.</p>
          <p>Two votes were sufficient to negative an application for membership. The
		term “black-ball” was not then in vogue. The new members when
		admitted were required to “promise not to divulge any of the secrets of
		the society.” The stringency of this provision has been since materially
		modified.</p>
          <p>It was made dangerous to “take umbrage at being fined,” and
		to denote it by word or action,” because, if the fine should be found to
		be legal, the accused must pay a quarter of a dollar for his squirming. There
		was mercifully no penalty for showing umbrage by a gloomy countenance unless
		the gloom was evidenced by frowning or other facial action.</p>
          <p>There seems to have been no fine for laughing or talking, unless a
		speaker was interrupted.</p>
          <p>The practice of wearing hats in the society, as is permitted in the
		English Parliament, was forbidden. The President, however, of at least one
		society, the Dialectic, was after some years required to preside with hat on,
		often a high-crowned beaver borrowed for the purpose.</p>
          <p>The admission fee was one quarter of a dollar. If a member absented
		himself for three months, without obtaining a diploma of dismission, he must
		seek a new admission.</p>
          <p>A member could leave the society without asking its consent, nor was any
		student compelled to join it. But having once left there could be no
		re-admission.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p75" n="75"/>
          <p>It shows the high purpose of the founders of the society, that the first
		motion made after the admission of members, at the first meeting on June 3d,
		1795, was for the purchase of books. It passed unanimously. The mover was Tutor
		Harris.</p>
          <p>The first speech made in this parent of the Dialectic and Philanthropic
		Societies was by James Mebane who sustained the affirmative of the first query
		ever debated, “Is the study of ancient authors useful?” He was
		answered by Robert Smith. I am proud to state that the classics won the
		day.</p>
          <p>At the second meeting, on June 11, 1795, it was agreed to admit no more
		new members. A great moral question was then discussed, the names of the
		speakers being omitted. This was “Is the truth always to be adhered
		to?” the decision being “that breaches of faith are sometimes
		proper.” It is gratifying to observe that the decisions of the queries
		debated were as a rule conservative and sensible.</p>
          <p>On the 25th of June, 1795, Maurice Moore moved that the society be
		divided. The motion was laid over for one week and on July 2d was taken up and
		carried. The new organization was called “The Concord Society.” We
		can only conjecture the cause of the new movement, as no reason appears on the
		journal. It is possible that there was in it an element of party feeling.
		Jeffersonian Democracy claimed to be the peculia advocate of the “Rights
		of Man.” The name Concord, and the substituted Philanthropic, and the
		addition of the word Liberty to the motto of the other society, look in this
		direction.</p>
          <p>Another reason for the division was probably to have the number so small
		as to allow and require every member to perform some duty at each weekly
		meeting. The prohibition of further addition to the membership of the first
		society seems to show this.</p>
          <p>A third reason for the change was, I think, hostility to the extensive
		powers and duties of the Censor Morum, heretofore described. I make this
		conjecture because the officer was omitted in the new body, and when it was
		restored after many months his duties were carefully confined to behavior of
		members in society. Even this however proved unsatisfactory and
		<pb xml:id="p76" n="76"/>the name was changed to Vice-President. It will now be
		admitted that the seceding students were right in their attitude. The Dialectic
		Society eventually came to the same conclusion.</p>
          <p>For some weeks it was allowable to belong to both societies, which was
		practicable as they met on different nights in order to have the use of the
		same room. The first student, Hinton James, and Maurice and Alfred Moore were
		for awhile active members of both. When the duplicate membership was forbidden
		they elected the new.</p>
          <p>I cannot find an official list of the “Fathers” of the
		Concord or Philanthropic Society, but after carefully examining the journal I
		think that the following can be relied on:</p>

          <p>The first meeting of the Concord Society was August 10, 1795. David
		Gillespie was the first President, Evan Jones the first Treasurer, Henry
		Kearney the first Clerk. The first debaters were George W. Long and Henry
		Kearney, on the question “Which is best—an Education or a
		Fortune?” It is consistent with the honorable career of the society that
		the decision was in favor of education.</p>
          <p>The first President, son of James Gillespie, of Duplin, member of
		Congress for eight years, was evidently a most promising student. By the
		courtesy of David S. Nicholson, I give a copy of the certificate granted him on
		his leaving the University, the first document in the nature of a diploma ever
		granted.</p>

          <p>To this was attached the certificate of Sam. Ashe, Governor, attested by
		Roger Moore, Private Secretary, with the great seal of the State, that the
		above-named were professors of the University as alleged.</p>
          <p>After working for about a year it occurred to the members of both
		societies that English names were not of sufficient dignity. Accordingly on the
		25th of August, 1796, in pursuance of a motion made by James Webb, of
		Hillsboro, a week preceding, the name Debating was changed into its Greek
		equivalent, Dialectic. And four days afterward, on the 29th of August, 1796,
		the Greek Philanthropic took the place of Concord, on motion of David
		Gillespie. I have no information <pb xml:id="p78" n="78"/>as to whether, when this
		name was adopted the pronunciation was wrongly Phi-lanthropic instead of
		Phil-anthropic. Johnson's dictionary, then the standard, gives no countenance
		to it, and I am inclined to think that the mispronunciation, prevalent here for
		many decades, arose from the custom universal among students of abbreviating
		names in common use, and from the euphonic wish to have the nickname sound like
		Di. Those familiar with university life know well that undergraduates would
		smash every dictionary in the land before they would be called Phils., or, as
		it soon would have become, <hi rend="italics">Phillies.</hi></p>
          <p>The Fundamental Laws, afterwards called Constitution, and the course of
		proceedings of the two societies were much alike.</p>
          <p>In the Concord for a short while new members could be admitted by a
		majority vote. The first restriction was the requirement of two-thirds in case
		the applicant was under fifteen years of age. I notice no other material
		differences, and I make no further distinction between the two in endeavoring
		to reproduce their action.</p>
          <p>In the declamations, then called “speaking,” we miss Patrick
		Henry's “give me liberty or give me death,” because that speech was
		written by Wirt long afterwards, nor of course do we find Emmet's, “Let
		no man write my epitaph.” In their places were Cicero's denunciations of
		Verres, and Demosthenes' thunderings against Philip, Micipsa's plea against
		Jugurtha, Brutus over the body of Lucretia, Catalines' speech to his soldiers,
		and the like.</p>
          <p>It is surprising that the stock utterances of our Revolutionary sires,
		such as Otis, Adams, Henry, Rutledge, R. H. Lee, were not reproduced in our
		halls. It is in accord with the hatred of Great Britain which had not all waned
		that there were no selections from the great English orators.</p>
          <p>The readings were extracts from history, poetry, the Spectator, and the
		like literature. They were generally serious; occasionally comic, for example,
		“The Stuttering Soldier.” “The Bald-headed Cove.”
		“Anecdote of Miss Bush.” It shows the difference in the habit of
		matutinal sleeping that one of the essays was in ridicule of “The Boy Who
		Lay in Bed After <pb xml:id="p79" n="79"/>Sunrise.” The extract chosen by
		David Gillespie from the preface to Murray's Grammar, just out of press, was of
		sufficient gravity.</p>
          <p>Not many of the subjects of composition are given. Among them I notice
		“Oratory,” “Eloquence,” “Unpoliteness,”
		“Industry.”</p>
          <p>But the subjects chosen for debates, and the votes taken thereon, throw
		much greater light on the intellectual attitude of the students. I therefore
		cull from the records of both societies such of those subjects as will show the
		tastes and opinions of the members during the first two years of the university
		life.</p>
          <p>I have already shown that the decision was that education is better than
		riches. It was likewise decided that public education is of more advantage than
		private, and <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">horribile
		dictu</foreign>,</hi>that the schoolmaster is of more advantage to society
		than the preacher. The members were of the opinion that wisdom tends to
		happiness; that modern history is of more value to students than ancient; that
		a liberal education is more conducive to happiness than a savage life. The
		theory of Rousseau, that savage is on the whole happier than civilized life,
		was at one time affirmed; at another, negatived. It was voted that the French
		language is of more value than the Latin.</p>
          <p>In an unguarded moment one of the societies agreed to discuss whether
		traveling improves the mind, whereupon there is the following curious entry,
		“As the question intended for debate is not “thinkable,” the
		opponents coincided in opinion. The debate was therefore not a good one, but,
		after the regular business was over, we debated on this question, “Does a
		man with a competency, or he who is in a very affluent station, enjoy most
		happiness.” The admirers of Solomon will be gratified to know that
		competency was successful.</p>
          <p>This incident reminds me that Mrs. Delphina E. Mendenhall, of Guilford,
		a Quakeress, presented to the Dialectic Society Dymond's Essays, advocating
		universal peace. When a student I induced the Query Committee to report the
		question, taken from the essays, “Is War Ever Justifiable?” The
		great debaters in the society declared that it was altogether one-sided,
		<pb xml:id="p80" n="80"/>refused to discuss it, and censured the committee for
		adopting a query on one side of which nothing could be said. As it was not my
		turn to speak, I had not crammed on the subject from Dymond and was unable to
		bring forward a single Quaker argument in order to avert the displeasure of the
		house.</p>
          <p>The last educational topic will astonish readers of this generation. It
		was however discussed seriously in a literary society of an American
		university, “Shall Corporal Punishment be Introduced Into the
		University?” The memory of smarting backs and knuckles produced an
		emphatic No! I must explain that the small boys in the institution had not then
		been separated from the rest and placed in a preparatory department.</p>
          <p>The members were fairly orthodox, although infidelity and lawless
		theories were so prevalent throughout the world. It was decided that Religion
		makes mankind happy, that Self-Conceit does not produce happiness, that the
		Bible is to be believed, that the Profligate is more unhappy than the Moralist,
		that Polygamy is not consistent with the will of God, that temporary marriages
		would not conduce to the good of society, that Suicide can never be
		justifiable. Even on the concrete question, whether Lucretia was justifiable in
		killing herself, it was voted that the poor lady was blameable, although by her
		martyrdom she inaugurated popular government in Rome.</p>
          <p>On what is called the Jesuitical doctrine of Pious Frauds, it was voted
		that they are wrong, although on the similar question whether it is ever
		allowable to tell lies the members agreed with military men, statesmen and
		others that occasion may arise to justify them. As to which is most despicable
		the Thief or the Liar, the decision was that the Thief was the worst. Indeed on
		another occasion it was solemnly voted that he ought to be hung instead of
		receiving the milder punishment of forty stripes save one. On the question,
		“Is Debauchery or Drunkenness most prejudicial,” drunkenness was
		pronounced the lesser evil. The miser was considered an unworthy character
		evidently, because it was discussed whether we have the right to kill him and
		distribute his property. He was spared. A blow was struck at the Sermon on the
		Mount when it was decided that it is not consistent with reason to love one's
		enemies. <pb xml:id="p81" n="81"/>It is gratifying that they thought that actions
		cannot be politically right and morally wrong. Whether duelling is ever
		justifiable was discussed several times. Twice it was sustained and once the
		decision was adverse, though it is significant that Tutor Harris then opened
		the debate. Salaried ministers of the gospel should breathe more freely on
		learning that the students of 1796 deemed it conformable to the Christian
		religion for preachers to get wages. Fun-lovers should be comforted in knowing
		their opinion, that “moderate fortune and good humor are preferable to a
		large estate and bad disposition.”</p>
          <p>Other decisions were: that Health is better than Riches; that love of
		mankind is more prevalent than love of money; that Flattery is sometimes
		useful; that the pursuit of an object gives greater happiness than the
		enjoyment; that Pride is essential to happiness; that a man is happier in
		seeking his own approbation than in seeking that of others; that a state of
		Nature is a state of war; that the Immortality of the soul is not deducible
		from reason; that beasts have no souls. It is surprising that young men in the
		last decade of the 18th century, with the war spirit hot throughout the world,
		debated with warmth, but could not be brought to a decision, the question,
		“Is it justifiable to kill one who is threatening one's life?”</p>
          <p>Among the moral and religious questions it should perhaps be mentioned
		that the opponents of such amusements as dancing, fox hunting, horse racing,
		and the like, had the strength to bring forward the query, “Is it politic
		for the Trustees to permit a Dancing School at the University?” They were
		out-voted.</p>
          <p>During the first years of the University the students were totally
		debarred from the society of ladies of their own age, as the village was merely
		on paper. It is to be noted, however, that none the less was their interest in
		all questions of a social nature. “Does a matrimonial or single life
		confer most happiness” was gravely decided in favor of marriage.
		“Are Talents or Riches greater recommendations to ladies?” was
		asked, and the society honored the fair sex by answering “Talents.”
		“Are ladies or wine most deleterious to students?” was another
		question, <pb xml:id="p82" n="82"/>the palm for deleteriousness being awarded, I
		grieve to say, to the ladies. Greater gratitude was shown, however, in the
		decision of the next, “Is female modesty natural or affected?”
		nature getting the credit. The members wrestled with this rather nebulous
		speculation, “Is love without hope, or malice without revenge, most
		injurious,” but never came to a conclusion. I presume this was one of the
		“non-thinkable” subjects. The members knew their own minds however
		on this question, “Should a man marry for gold or for beauty?”, the
		preference being given to the red metal.</p>
          <p>Of course questions of public policy were frequently debated. Indeed one
		enthusiastic member proposed that the Constitution of the United States should
		be discussed clause by clause, but this was too great a task. The extent of the
		powers granted by the Constitution, the unconstitutionality of acts of
		Congress, seem not to have attracted attention. I find only questions of
		expediency or the reverse. For example, “Is an excise tax consistent with
		the principles of Liberty?” answered in the affirmative. “Are
		standing armies useful?” answered No. “Are the salaries of United
		States officers too great?” answered Yes. “Is the neutrality of the
		United States in the French-British War consistent with gratitude?”
		answer, Yes. “Should the United States pay the British debts?”
		answer, No. “Which is best a pure Democracy or a mixed government?”
		answer, Mixed. “Should foreigners be allowed to hold offices in the
		United States?” answer at one time, Yes; at another, No. “Should
		army officers be appointed by the executive or Legislature?” answer, by
		the executive. “Should our diplomatic intercourse be diminished?”
		answer, No. “Is there just cause of war by the United States against
		France?” (February, 1797), decision, No. In April the same discussion
		arose and the war spirit gained the vote. Should our Navy be increased?”
		decision, Yes. “Should the United States further negotiate with
		Algiers?” Decision, No. “Is it equitable and politic to confiscate
		private property in war?” decision, Yes. “Is Spain blameable for
		obstructing the navigation of the Mississippi?” decision, Yes. “Are
		treaties contrary to the Law of Nations binding?” decision, Yes.
		“Should the United States adopt Sumptuary Laws?” decision, Yes.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p83" n="83"/>
          <p>It is remarkable that the question should have been debated, “Is
		the Constitution of England or the United States preferable?” The
		decision, as might be expected, was in favor of the United States. The members
		pronounced themselves in favor of a protective tariff. They anticipated the
		action of this State sixty-one years in declaring for free suffrage for both
		branches of the General Assembly. This shows the preponderance of Western
		members. They likewise voted against the use of paper money. When this question
		was called, Robert Burton, afterwards a North Carolina judge, and Nathaniel
		Williams, afterwards a Tennessee judge, who had been appointed to open the
		debate, declined to speak for the reason that they knew nothing of the subject.
		This excuse was unanimously disallowed and they were promptly fined.</p>
          <p>When it was argued “Is peace or war most useful?”, it is
		honestly recorded that the vote was in favor of war “from the
		arguments.” That Commerce is useful to Nations only passed by a majority
		vote. As to the relative advantageousness of Commerce and Agriculture, the
		preference was given to commerce. Was not this the old contest between Poseidon
		against Athena, Neptune against Minerva?</p>
          <p>On the slavery question the members on the whole took the Southern view,
		yet there was evident a want of enthusiasm, if not positive doubt. It is likely
		that the decision on the query, “Whether Africans have not as much right
		to enslave Americans as Americans to enslave Africans?” viz.: that
		“Africans have as good right, if not better,” was in a jocular
		spirit. But there was no joking in the declaration that Death is preferable to
		Slavery, but it is probable that they meant slavery to white people. The fact,
		however, that the members discussed the question “Whether slaves are
		advantageous to the United States?” and “Whether the importation of
		African slaves is of advantage to the United States?” shows that there
		was difference of opinion, although the majority was in the affirmative in both
		cases. A spirit of doubt as to the beneficence of the institution seems to be
		implied in the question “Should slavery be abolished at this
		time?”, notwithstanding that the members answered no.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p84" n="84"/>
          <p>I give a few miscellaneous questions perhaps worthy to be recorded. The
		right of the Legislatures of the States to instruct members of Congress was
		debated but not decided. It is noticeable that a serious discussion was had as
		to whether public offices should be venal, i. e., at liberty to be bought and
		sold. The decision was adverse. It is in affirmance of what political
		economists say of the abominable evils of the poor laws of England at this time
		that a debate was had as to the propriety of making any provision for paupers,
		although the conclusion was favorable. The members voted that the fathers
		should retain the power of disinheriting altogether their children, although
		admirers of French ways contended otherwise. The latter, however, succeeded in
		obtaining a majority vote that Louis XVI. was justly beheaded. The members
		showed their jealousy of the Federal government by voting on one occasion that
		official salaries were too high, and on another that members of Congress should
		be paid less wages than soldiers. They voted at one time that bodily strength
		is better than valor in war, and at another that ingenuity is superior to
		bodily strength. It seems that the vegetarian theory, one of the first modern
		absurd “isms,” had penetrated to our wilds, because the prohibition
		of animal food was discussed, but it was too much to expect our keen-stomached
		students with visions of ham and roast beef, or the savory fried chicken at
		to-morrow's dinner, to vote against their consumption.</p>
          <p>In the spring of 1796 both societies voted to substitute a play for all
		other exercises, and the members made preparations with enthusiasm. This action
		was probably stimulated by the advent of a tutor, Mr. Richards, who had been an
		actor. The scenery was purchased at Williamsboro, but it does not appear why
		such apparatus was in that village. Such was the zeal of the amateur Thespians
		that one of the members who agreed to take two parts and failed without excuse
		was incontinently expelled from one of the societies. I regret that I can find
		no description of this great dramatic performance.</p>
          <p>As showing the contrast between the reading room of 1796 and that of one
		hundred years later I state that a motion was made in one of the societies that
		the <hi rend="italics">Halifax Journal</hi>be subscribed <pb xml:id="p85" n="85"/>
		for in behalf of the members; whereupon Alexander McCulloch, brother-in-law of
		William Boylan, one of the editors, generously offered the use of his copy, and
		the motion was withdrawn. A subsequent motion to buy the <hi rend="italics">Fayetteville Hinerva</hi>was defeated, as one paper was deemed
		sufficient. The following is the first list of books ever purchased by either
		society. It shows taste for solid reading—not a novel among them.</p>
          <list type="simple">

        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>EARLY STUDENT LIFE—THE PETTIGREW LETTERS.</head>
          <p>By the kindness of Miss Caroline Pettigrew, granddaughter of Ebenezer
		Pettigrew, who with his brother John was a student of the University from the
		spring of 1795 to the fall of <pb xml:id="p86" n="86"/>1797, I am able to give
		glimpses of the inner life of the University in its infancy from letters
		written by them to their father. Their father was Rev. Charles Pettigrew, of
		Tyrrell County, who was chosen Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church, but
		was prevented, by the breaking out of yellow fever in Philadelphia at the time,
		and failing health afterwards, from being consecrated. I have also been
		permitted by Mr. Norman Jones, of Raleigh, to examine a letter dated April,
		1795, written to his mother by his ancestor, Nicholas Long, grandson of Colonel
		Nicholas Long, of the North Carolina Continental line.</p>
          <p>Letters by children to their parents were then as a rule much more
		formal than is now usual. Long addresses his mother as “Honored
		Mother;” but the Pettigrews wrote “Dear Father.” Long's
		father was dead and his mother had married a Methodist preacher, Rev. Daniel
		Shine. He sends his “respects” to Mr. Shine. A married sister he
		calls Sister Hill, and the husband of another sister he calls “Brother
		Green.” The Presiding Professor he called Rev. Parson Ker. The Pettigrews
		sign themselves, or rather John signs for both, “your dutiful
		sons.” They always send their “duties” to their mother and
		compliments to all others. In one letter the word “compliments” was
		in the message to the mother, but it was scratched out and “duties”
		substituted. Bishop Pettigrew's letter to Jackey and Ebley, as he calls them,
		are exceedingly affectionate and wise.</p>
          <p>The boys saw no newspapers. Weeks intervened between letters. The
		postage to Bertie County, where Dr. Pettigrew once lived, is usually endorsed
		17 cents. Once John informed him that he was forced to pay at Chapel Hill 12
		1-2 cents when his father prepaid the same amount. The latter afterwards
		retorted: “What you designed for frugality accidentally resulted
		otherwise. You thought by your two letters on the same sheet, or rather half
		sheet of post paper, to save expenses, but I find 44 cents on the letter. 45 is
		just the postage of three letters. Your putting two wafers and two addresses
		has made it a double letter for which they charge double postage.” The
		consistency of the charges of the Postal Department seems open to criticism,
		judging from the foregoing statements.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p87" n="87"/>
          <p>We learn from these letters, and from other sources, something of the
		modes of travel to and from the University. Some came on horseback, some in
		“chairs” or double sulkies, others in carts. Long wrote that, if
		“the boy” would start by daybreak with the horse, he might make the
		journey from his home, Sandy Creek, in Franklin County, 65 miles, in one day.
		The following extract from one of the Pettigrew letters shows the difficulty of
		transporting persons and things. “Send up a double chair with a
		portmanteau and a pair of saddle-bags (as our chests will be too unhandy to be
		carried in a chair), in which we could carry our clothes and some particular
		books, but as there are a great many of them it would be needless to attempt
		carrying them all in a chair. In my opinion it would be best for the rest to
		stay until December when the boys who will come from Bertie will be coming up
		in a cart, and as the cart will be going back empty I have no doubt they would
		take down a chest of books to Windsor, from whence they might easily be
		conveyed to Tyrrell. My bed I can dispose of.” They were not expecting to
		return to the University.</p>
          <p>Among other things they tell of the sad necessity of going nearly
		barefoot, because of the non-existence of a shoemaker in the village. They
		hope, however, that an itinerant mender of shoes while on his circuit will come
		to their relief. They asked their father to have pairs of new shoes ready at
		their homes when the session shall be over, for, said they, shoes are expensive
		at Chapel Hill, being 18 shillings or $1.80 a pair. They marked the
		length of their feet on the margin of the big sheet on which they wrote, thus
		giving us a hint of the rudeness of the foot coverings of that day, no other
		measure than the length being given to the workman. If they had enclosed a slip
		instead of notching the paper it would have subjected the letter to double
		postage, i. e., the postage of the order would have been nearly 20 per cent of
		the cost of the article.</p>
          <p>Another trouble they had was the difficulty of procuring a bed, meaning
		one made of the soft feathers of geese. They slept for a while at the house of
		a family named Kimball, in the only room to be rented in town, but, the
		Kimballs announcing their intention to move to “Caintuck”
		(Kentucky), it became <pb xml:id="p88" n="88"/>necessary for the boys to move into
		the college building, and hence a bed of their own was essential. They state
		that the Steward, Mr. Taylor, had beds to rent for the enormous price of
		£12, or $24 per annum. Their father earnestly cautioned them
		against the danger of sleeping on hard boards after enjoying the luxury of
		feathers all the summer, and saved them from this evil by sending the coveted
		piece of furniture from his home in the “chair” designed for the
		return of the boys in vacation.</p>
          <p>Moving into the Old East, they were forced to share the apartment with
		four others, but they were comforted by the fact that two of them were little
		boys of the Grammar School. Some of the “small boys” they
		discovered were loud-mouthed nuisances. They found in this room a more grievous
		nuisance even than noisy “small boys”—the bully. “One
		of our room-mates desires,” they wrote, “to reign king, saying if
		we would not obey him he would use rough methods.” Those who had breathed
		the free air of the Albemarle could not submit to be slaves. “This we
		disliked,” they said, “knowing that no student durst take upon
		himself the authority, and that we were all on an equality, and to be
		room-mates and not one inferior to another.” Although the aspiring Kaiser
		was in a minority of one to five, the Pettigrews changed their quarters, but
		John remarked, “I shall say nothing of my new companions until I get
		better acquainted with them.” He added, “There is only room for
		five or six more, unless the Trustees allow eight in a room, which we earnestly
		deprecate. I find it very difficult to get six well-behaved, it would be almost
		impossible to get eight well-behaved, boys in a room.”</p>
          <p>As might be expected these growing boys were much concerned about their
		food. They praised Mrs. Puckett when they boarded with her, but the strictures
		on food at Commons are generally severe. At one time they said “The bread
		is not near so good as <hi rend="italics">Fillis</hi>bakes for herself. It is
		impossible to describe the badness of the tea and coffee, and the meat
		generally stinks and has maggots in it.” “Fillis”
		(“Phyllis”) is evidently their mother's cook, and the bread for
		herself was in all probability old-fashioned ashcakes, i. e., lumps of
		corn-meal dough, covered over with hot embers and so baked.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p89" n="89"/>
          <p>At another time these sons of a planter, who raised corn by the
		boat-load on the rich eastern bottoms, wrote: “We are afraid we will be
		pushed for provisions as Mr. Taylor (the Steward) buys corn by the bag-full. In
		case of necessity we shall get into hollow trees and do as the bears do. It
		would never do to set off for home. We would perish on the road.”</p>
          <p>A more horrible grievance arose from those hideous animals, who, in the
		darkness of the night, hasten to imbrue their jaws in human gore. Pine
		bedsteads with holes in the sides for the cords, and the wooden chests of six
		young fellows, ignorant of the arts of extermination, or too indolent to adopt
		them, gave full play to the Malthusian doctrine of increase by geometrical
		ratio, of these foes of man. We need not be surprised therefore at their rapid
		multiplication in one year. “We dread the approach of warm
		weather,” they plaintively wrote. “They are five times as bad as
		last year, and then we were hardly able to rest. We will not need any bleeding
		(by physicians). There is one comfort, there are no mosquitoes.” These
		nocturnal foes they called Sabines, an inappropriate name it appears to me, as
		the historians tell us those robbers carried off young ladies; whereas young
		men were here the victims. The next year they raise a wail of woe: “The
		Sabines have quite defeated us. We have given them the entire possession of our
		room. None of us have been able to sleep in it for five weeks. I generally
		spread out tables in the passage and pour water around the legs. They are in
		general poor swimmers.” All these horrors, notwithstanding a by-law which
		ordered the students to cleanse their rooms of bugs every two weeks! How their
		mother's heart must have ached at the persecution of her darlings!</p>
          <p>In October, 1795, is the first mention of a dismissal of a student. The
		Pettigrew boys say he was “banished.” As the offence recalls a
		custom among our ancestors which has become obsolete, I must, in the interest
		of folk-lore, explain it. Frank Burton and Joseph Green, after being
		prohibited, went to a “Cotton Picking.”</p>
          <p>What was a Cotton Picking? I am able to give you the information derived
		from two veracious witnesses, in their youth participants in the game.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p90" n="90"/>
          <p>Before the use of Whitney's gin had become common the seed of cotton was
		separated from the lint by hand. This was generally done at night, each member
		of the household having his or her task. Each was compelled to fill one of his
		or her shoes with seed before being allowed to “court the balmy,”
		as Dick Swiviller termed it. Of course, children and ladies of small feet had
		the advantage over those of mountainous understandings who went late to bed.
		Darwin would explain the great preponderance of ladies of little feet, such as
		we see in all Southern gatherings, by the theory that females of former
		generations, able to wear diminutive shoes, filled them with seed early in the
		night, secured a larger amount of refreshing sleep, became thereby more healthy
		and beautiful, and in consequence always secured husbands, while the haggard
		faces of those going late to bed condemned the unfortunate big-footians to
		single blessedness.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the owner of the snowy pile would invite the young men and
		maidens to a Cotton Picking frolic, analagous to quiltings, corn-shuckings, and
		log-rollings, providing toothsome refreshments. The cotton was placed in the
		middle of the room, parties would pick against each other, and amid
		good-humored rivalry and rustic merriment the work would soon be finished. Then
		the floor would be swept and the neighborhood fiddler, often as black as ebony,
		would strike up “Molly put the Kettle on,” or “T-u Turkey, Ty
		Tie, T-u Turkey Buzzard's Eye,” or “Crow he Peeped at the
		Weasel,” or “Old Molly Hare,” in such entrancing strains that
		every toe in the assembly became stark crazy as if smitten by St. Vitus. Even
		the legs of the table would quiver with excitement. A jolly succession of reels
		and break-downs and “Cutting the pigeon's wing” would ensue. If the
		preacher's influence prevented dancing, games were substituted such as
		“Hunt the Slipper,” “Blindman's Buff,” or “I'm
		Pining.” Burton and Green were attracted to one of these festivals, even
		as the candle-fly seeks the blazing torch. They had their fun, but the avenging
		eye of Dr. Ker was upon them. The sentence was public admonition before the
		University. Burton, “like a little man,” took the medicine and
		afterwards won honors as a student. <pb xml:id="p91" n="91"/>But Joe Green's pride
		caused him to decline to submit and so sentence of dismissal was passed on him.
		I think it no harm to give his name as heading the line of students whose
		presence has been dispensed with by the Faculty; first, because he became a
		respected merchant of New Bern, his career not being impeded by this incident,
		and secondly, his offence was not a <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">malum in se</foreign>,</hi>but 
		<hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">malum prohibitum</foreign></hi>only.</p>
          <p>It appears that Bishop Pettigrew requested his sons to give him
		confidential information as to the manners and morals of the students. They do
		so, but like loyal students ask him not to divulge their disclosures,
		satirically remarking, “its (the University's) character will be known
		soon enough to its disadvantage and confusion.” Their secret report thus
		made was that: “the students in general have nothing very criminal,
		except a vile and detestable practice of cursing and swearing—which are
		carried on here to the greatest perfection. Even from the smallest to the
		largest they vent their oaths with the greatest ease imaginable. Hardly a
		sentence passes without some of those high-flown words which sailors divert
		themselves with.” “Their favorite book is Paine's Age of
		Reason.” Doubtless this account is substantially true. Profanity and
		infidelity were the fashion of the day. It should be taken, however, with the
		explanation that John and Ebenezer were raised on a large plantation, strictly
		and religiously, and probably were never associated with boys before. They do
		not give examples of the oaths. Let us charitably hope that many of them were
		no worse than “Go to the Dickens,” “Deuce Take You,”
		“Durn It,” “Dog Gone You,” and like expletives, which
		some people do not distinguish from more pronounced profanity. It is comforting
		to have the report favorable as to drinking, gambling, and the like.</p>
          <p>John writes that while Ebenezer is unable for lack of funds, he himself
		has joined a dancing school, saying that he could not forego gaining what he
		calls “such a genteel accomplishment.” He adds, “There are a
		number of students in the class, but not any ladies, and there is not as much
		order and regularity as if there were several decent ladies.” The terms
		were $4 for six months' instruction.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p92" n="92"/>
          <p>Their report as to study is, to use their expression,
		“middling” favorable. They say: “the Seniors and others who
		are old enough to understand its value study pretty closely, but there are a
		great many small boys, half of whom do little or nothing. They are the ones who
		make the greatest proficiency in the art of swearing.”</p>
          <p>The letter-writers praise highly Dr. Ker and Professor Harris. For the
		particular information of Latin students I state that they studied Eutropius
		and Cornelius Nepos before going into Cæsar. Their testimony is that they
		learned more Latin in a few months than in all their lives before.</p>
          <p>As a contribution to the Society for Investigating Psychical Phenomena,
		I give a strange coincidence. Bishop Pettigrew and his wife both dreamed the
		same night that their sons were sick, and at that very moment, although
		separated by all the distance from Chapel Hill to Tyrrell County, about 180
		miles as the crow flies, these boys were in unusual good health, and so
		continued for months. If only one of them had been, simultaneously with the
		dreams, a little ailing, even to the extent of a head or tooth-ache, or
		groaning over the agonies of a green peach or so, what exultation would have
		filled the breasts of enthusiastic spiritualists.</p>
          <p>We gather also from the letters something of the health of the students
		and of the practice of medicine a hundred years ago. John Pettigrew had an
		enlarged spleen when he came, but it improved at Chapel Hill, although he was
		not cured. At one time he took for it arrow-root steeped in brandy two or three
		times a day. This remedy he quit because of the high price of the brandy, 75
		cents a quart. He then turned to Peruvian bark and snake-root, at one time
		ceasing for ten days because he could obtain no snake-root. Twice his spleen
		grew in size, but he attributes that to the want of exercise.</p>
          <p>On April 12, 1796, he wrote: “There are 86 students here. All are
		in perfect health except one taken with the rheumatism last night.” In a
		letter dated May 27, 1797, he wrote, “The mumps is a disease which is
		very prevalent. There are 30 or 40 cases, but none have been hurt by them very
		much. Ebley and I have had no symptoms as yet.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p93" n="93"/>
          <p>“The small-pox is seven or eight miles from here, brought by a man
		from Norfolk. He is well, but it is rumored that his mother has been taken. I
		do not believe that it will come here, as people are much afraid of it and use
		all precautions. It would certainly be destructive to this institution, as I
		have no doubt it would kill one-half of those infected, as our blood is in as
		bad a state as possible owing to the vast quantities of butter which we eat,
		and we have no proper attendance. But we would get horses and go home.”
		The disease did not reach Chapel Hill then or at any subsequent day.</p>
          <p>John was a draughtsman and sent home a colored picture of the Old East,
		1797, two-storied and only two-thirds of its present length. [The bricks are of
		the original color, except that between the first and second stories there is a
		broad white band all around the building. There is a platform at each outer
		door, the steps descending from it towards the north and south.]</p>
          <p>Let me add that John's disease carried him off—an exceedingly
		promising man—two years after he left the University. Ebenezer became a
		prosperous planter; his plantations Magnolia and Belgrade, in Washington
		County, were famous for their fertility and good management. He was induced
		when a young man to serve two terms in the State Senate and, after passing
		middle life, to be a member of the House of Representatives of the United
		States, but he preferred the happier life of a private citizen. His youngest
		son was the lamented General James Johnston Pettigrew, a graduate of 1847, who
		seemed to me to be the ablest man I ever met. Commodore Maury, who had seen the
		greatest men of his day said—this I know to be authentic—that if by
		any cause General Lee's place should be vacated, General Pettigrew would be the
		fittest man to take his place.</p>

          <p>In December, 1795, after a year's experience with the raw, mostly

          <p>In addition to the regular course, the Professor of Languages must
		“attend, when required, the reading of Cicero de Officiis, and Horace and
		Livy, and in the Greek Longinus on the Sublime, the Orations of Demosthenes and

		attended to, the different forms and figures of speech are to be noticed by the
		professor, and comments made on the sentiments and beauties of the authors;
		parallel sentences quoted, particular idioms observed, and all allusions to
		distant manners and customs explained.</p>
          <p>The students under the Professor of Languages are to deliver to him
		twice a week translations into English of some classic, in which, “after
		expressing the sense of the author, the spirit and elegance of the translation
		are principally to be regarded.”</p>
          <p>The students of the other classes shall every Saturday deliver to the

          <p>Those passing approved examinations on the studies of the Preparatory
		School were entitled to be admitted “upon the general establishment of
		the University.”</p>
          <p>Those passing an approved examination in English, and the first four
		rules of Arithmetic with the Rule of Three, could be admitted to study under
		the President and any of the Professors, except the Professor of Languages. In
		order to enter his department the applicant must stand an approved examination
		on the English language, and on Cæsar's Commentaries and Sallust. But it
		was not required to translate English into Latin.</p>
          <p>No preliminary examination was required of one wishing to study under
		the fourth professor, i. e., Chemistry, the Philosophy of Medicine, Agriculture
		and the Mechanic Arts.</p>
          <p>There were no prizes instituted by professors, but the Trustees
		endeavored to stimulate study by offering to donate a book to the best scholar
		in each department, viz.: a copy of the text-book used therein. The early
		students either borrowed or rented their text-books.</p>
          <p>This plan of education is all the more observable because it was the
		work of Davie after mature consideration. The record shows that he offered it,
		that it was referred to a committee composed of himself, Judge Williams, Hogg,
		Haywood, <pb xml:id="p97" n="97"/>and Adlai Osborne, and was reported back and
		adopted. The <hi rend="italics">North Carolina Journal</hi>of that date has,
		doubtless in Davie's words, a statement of the object aimed at. He began by
		quoting from the French Convention, “That in every free government the
		law emanates from the people, it is necessary that the people should receive an
		education to enable them to direct the laws, and the political part of this
		education should be consonant to the principles of the constitution under which
		they live.” He proceeds: “The plan of Education established by the
		Board appears to be predicated on this principle, and designed to form useful
		and respectable members of society—citizens capable of comprehending,
		improving and defending the principles of government, citizens, who from the
		highest possible impulse, a just sense of their own and the general happiness,
		would be induced to practice the duties of social morality. A deep and fixed
		conviction that it is degrading to be tributaries to other States or countries
		for our literary and public characters, a general and strong desire to promote
		education and exalt and improve our national character, have given a tone to
		the public sentiment and bestowed a degree of emulation upon individuals, from
		which the most happy effects may be expected.”</p>
          <p>Davie remembered that many of the leading men of the Revolution in North
		Carolina were from other States. Certainly the degrading dependence of our
		State for its public characters ceased after the establishment of the
		University. Not only that, but the institution has furnished chief legislative,
		executive, or judicial officers to all our Southern sisters, as well as to the
		general government.</p>
          <p>In correspondence with Caldwell on the subject of granting degrees,
		Davie gave a clear exposition of the principles underlying his scheme.
		“The variation of the plan from that of other colleges makes the question
		of degrees a difficult one. A bachelor's degree generally imports a knowledge
		of the learned languages as well as the sciences. To confer such a degree upon
		a person who can understand neither Latin or Greek does not appear to be
		proper. The ruling or leading principle in our plan of education is that the
		student may apply himself to those branches of learning and science alone which
		are absolutely <pb xml:id="p98" n="98"/>necessary to fit him for his destined
		profession or occupation in life. One study does not imply the necessity of any
		other, unless of one necessary to make it intelligible. But I am well convinced
		of the utility and policy of conferring degrees and granting special
		certificates.” He then asks criticism of the following plan: First. The
		degree of Bachelor of Arts (A.B) evidenced by a diploma in the Latin language,
		for proficiency in English, the sciences and either Latin or Greek. Second. A
		diploma in English certifying knowledge and progress in the arts and sciences,
		to one omitting both the classics. He does not suggest a name for this
		diploma.</p>
          <p>These diplomas, as well as that of the Master's degree, should be signed
		by the President of the Board and another Trustees. In addition to the
		diplomas, certificates should be granted by the President of the University,
		specially stating the progress of the student.</p>
          <p>After Davie left the State in 1805, Caldwell acquired such commanding
		influence as to assimilate this University to Princeton, his alma mater. Only
		one diploma was granted, that of Bachelor of Arts (A.B.), both Latin and Greek
		being essential to obtaining it, and this rule continued for many years. After
		the re-organization in 1875, Davie's plan somewhat modified was re-introduced.
		Both classics were still required for A.B., but a new degree of equal dignity
		was adopted where one classic is omitted, that of Bachelor of Philosophy, while
		if both classics are omitted, equivalent sciences being substituted, the degree
		of Bachelor of Science (B.S) is conferred. Several great institutions, notably
		Harvard and Cornell, now grant Bachelor of Arts, without requiring either
		classic, and this institution has recently followed their example. All
		universities grant certificates for special attainments.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable that, after the University fell into the old Latin,
		Greek and Mathematical curriculum, which prevailed through so many decades, the
		scheme drawn by General Davie should have been substantially revived in our
		days. As proving the truth of this I mention the large liberty of electing
		studies, the not rigidly requiring Latin and Greek as necessary to graduation,
		the elevation of Chemistry, Agriculture and the <pb xml:id="p99" n="99"/>Mechanic
		Arts to a separate school, which can be solely attended, the requiring of
		classical and mathematical students a moderate proficiency in science, and
		making advanced work in these departments elective, the great prominence given
		to the study of English literature and the attainment of a clear and graceful
		style in speaking and writing, the other languages being expressly declared to
		be auxiliary to this, the elevation of the French to equal rank with the
		classics, and the allowance of the substitution of French for either Latin or
		Greek. Indeed if we cut down our professorships to six, as was the case in
		Davie's scheme, (President and five professors) it becomes apparent that the
		changes of our day are mere centennial revivals, although not intentionally
		so.</p>
          <p>The plan of education of to-day is an evolution mainly by the initiation
		of the Faculty, the Trustees as a matter of course ratifying their
		recommendations. In 1795, however, the Trustees controlled this as well as the
		other details of the institution, even prescribing text-books. Accordingly we
		find that the scheme was soon so modified as to strike out Geography as a
		required study in the Preparatory School, and Montesquieu's Spirit of Laws,
		Vattel's Law of Nations and Hume's History of England in the University.
		Astronomy was to be on the plan of Nicholson instead of Ferguson.</p>
          <p>The difficulty of procuring books in the old times may be conjectured by
		this fact, that the Trustees purchased as many as six sets of the prescribed
		books, of others only three, to be rented to the students at a moderate
		hire.</p>
          <p>It was found impracticable to put the new scheme, requiring a President
		and five professors, into full operation for two reasons: First, because of the
		want of funds, and secondly, because the Trustees could not find a man
		possessed of the necessary presidential gifts willing to take the place.
		Accordingly Governor Samuel Ashe, President of the Board, and Messrs. Davie,
		Willie Jones, Hogg, and Stone were appointed a committee to make inquiry for a
		proper person to be president and to ascertain the terms on which he could be
		procured. Three professors were then balloted for and the following were
		unanimously chosen: Samuel E. McCorkle, Professor <pb xml:id="p100" n="100"/>of
		Moral and Political Philosophy and History; Charles W. Harris, Professor of
		Mathematics; Rev. David Ker, Professor of Languages. It was intended that Dr.
		McCorkle should have charge as Presiding Professor, thus dethroning Dr.
		Ker.</p>
          <p>But an unexpected difficulty arose. The canny Scotch-Irishman foresaw
		that, when the President should be chosen, he would lose the snug residence
		provided for the chief executive. He therefore demanded that in case this
		should happen his salary should be increased to the extent of the annual value
		of the residence. To this the Trustees declined to accede and so Dr. Ker
		continued in office until the following July, the University classes being
		taught by Professors Ker and Harris, and the Preparatory School by Nicholas
		Delveaux and Samuel Holmes, Delveaux having one of the higher classes in
		Latin.</p>
          <p>This rejection of the modest proposal of Dr. McCorckle was bitterly
		resented by his friends, although soon forgiven by that excellent man. Gen.
		John Steele, once a member of Congress and then first Comptroller of the
		Treasury, wrote General Davie a letter couched in such severe terms as to break
		the friendly relations between them. In the fall of 1799, after Davie's return
		from his mission to France, he endeavored to renew their old friendship.
		General Steele's answer, of which he kept a copy, shows that the sore was
		unhealed. He said, “My letter was the dictate of what I considered at the
		time, and still think, a just indignation for the ill treatment which Doctor
		McCorckle received.” . . . “I have no sons to educate, and my
		nephew (son of Dr. McCorckle) is relieved of the humiliation of acquiring his
		education at an institution whose outset was characterized by acts of
		ingratitude and insult towards his father.” As he begins the letter with
		a dry “Sir,” it is clear that resumption of friendly relations was
		for awhile of a formal and business nature.</p>
          <p>The six months' term ending July, 1796, witnessed many disorders among
		the students, the nature of which we can only conjecture. This much is certain,
		that there was dissatisfaction with Dr. Ker, that much against his inclination
		he was constrained to send in his resignation, and the Trustees accepted it
		under protest that he had not given six months' notice <pb xml:id="p101" n="101"/>
		as required by law. Professor Harris says that he was a man of talent, a
		furious Republican, and we learn from other sources that he became an outspoken
		infidel. Dr. Caldwell is authority also for the statement that another
		professor, Holmes, at that time “embraced and taught the wildest
		principles of licentiousness.”</p>
          <p>When we remember that Harris, an excellent character in other respects,
		likewise had imbibed heterodox principles, we can easily see how a spirit of
		lawlessness and defiance of authority became rampant in the young institution,
		and how bitterly the Federalists among the students resented the violent
		partisanship of the Presiding Professor.</p>
          <p>The by-laws of the University were also extremely vexatious. The boys of
		the Preparatory School, whom it became lawful to chastise as in other schools,
		were allowed to have rooms in the University building, and the strictest
		espionage, which might have been proper for their government, was enforced over
		grown young men—many of them accustomed to the largest liberty at home.
		The tutors of the Preparatory Department, sometimes undergraduates, were
		required to sleep among the students to see that they kept their rooms in study
		hours, to reprove and report them for every breach of the rules however
		trivial. Moreover the professors were ordered to visit each room twice a day,
		and monitors, one from each class, were expected to be spies on their fellows
		and to report their misdemeanors and even peccadilloes. The attempt several
		years afterwards to prevent the monitors from shirking this obligation led, as
		will be seen, to a serious disruption of the institution.</p>
          <p>The rules governing the conduct of the students while eating at Commons
		were still more likely to produce angry feelings. The tutor must reprove one
		complaining of the food unjustifiably in his opinion, and order one behaving
		unseemly from the table. This indignity created wrath in the youth subjected to
		such public insult, banished in disgrace from his food in presence of his
		fellows.</p>
          <p>While some of these rules and practices were from time to time
		rectified, others continued up to the end of the old regime
		<pb xml:id="p102" n="102"/>in 1868. Their abolition in 1876 has been productive of
		more kindly relations between Faculty and students and general improved conduct
		in the institution.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the disorders of the term, the Trustees who attended the
		examinations in July, 1796, including, among others, Governor Samuel Ashe and
		General Davie, certified that they were highly satisfactory and that many
		showed the strongest evidences of industry and most promising talents. The
		inspection began on Monday, the 11th of July, and was not finished until
		Friday, the 15th, Governor Ashe and a considerable number of Trustees, in
		addition to the committee, being present. The ladies did not vouchsafe their
		cheering presence. It is recorded that “several classes and some of the
		students received the marked approbation and applause of the Board and the
		committee.”</p>
          <p>A clear view of the condition of the University at this second
		Commencement is given in the report signed by General Davie and Wm. Hinton, of
		Wake, the only Trustees who witnessed all the examinations:</p>
          <p>The first or Senior class, consisting of six, were examined on Natural
		Philosophy and Mathematics and were distinguished for accuracy and
		progress.</p>
          <p>The second, or Junior class of 12, were examined on Geography. Six
		merited the marked approbation of the committee and were publicly
		commended.</p>
          <p>The third, or Sophomore class, consisted of 12; were examined on
		Arithmetic and obtained approbation.</p>
          <p>In Virgil and Cicero nine were examined. Those in Virgil did not give
		satisfaction; those in Cicero were somewhat better.</p>
          <p>The Rhetoric class did well. That in English Grammar, although numerous,
		acquitted themselves with approbation, as did also the French class. The like
		applause was given to the class in Cæsar and Sallust.</p>
          <p>The classes in Nepos, Eutropius and six other inferior classes in the
		Preparatory School were satisfactory.</p>
          <p>The Committee suggest that it is best to leave out Geography from the
		Preparatory School, “as most of the scholars will be too young to benefit
		much by the study in so early a state.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p103" n="103"/>
          <p>The action of the Board of Trustees at this time indicates two fruitful
		sources of trouble, the existence of the open grog-shops or taverns in the
		village, and the claim of the students of the Grammar School that they were
		only under the authority of their own tutors; and of the other students that
		those tutors had no control over the University students. Ordinances were
		passed prohibiting visiting of taverns without leave of a professor, vesting
		the Preparatory teachers with disciplinary authority over all the students and
		making them members of the Faculty, but without a vote. Six months later the
		right to vote was given, but the rule that the two tutors should occupy the
		same room in the University building was repealed.</p>
          <p>At the same meeting the students were authorized to attend dancing
		schools with the permission of the Faculty. A letter from Governor Spaight
		certifies to the teaching abilities of a Mr. Perrin, a French gentleman.
		“He does not undertake to teach the English dance, but the minuet and
		French dance, such as cotillons, conges, etc.” His terms were $2
		per month, three afternoons each week. Davie wrote, “I am very desirous
		that my sons should be taught to dance well. There are some French gentlemen at
		New Bern who teach dancing in the most elegant style. They are really gentlemen
		and unfortunate refugees from St. Domingo.” Doubtless Mr. Perrin was one
		of these refugees, as was Mr. Plunkett, who taught music in Mr. Mordecai's
		school in Warrenton a few years afterwards, forced to flee from the atrocities
		of the negroes in the island of Hayti, where they rose against the French,
		reduced from affluence to poverty in a strange land.</p>
          <p>In an unofficial letter Davie referred to another difficulty which seems
		to have been rectified. “Serious, and I believe, well-grounded complaints
		are made by the students against the Steward, but Messrs. Ker and Harris did
		not think proper to mention them to the Board although they gave assurance to
		the students that they would certainly do so.” It should be remembered,
		however, that his two sons, Hyder and Allen, who had been accustomed to
		luxurious living, probably imparted this information, and we have not the
		counter-statement of the professors. The <hi rend="italics">North Carolina
		Journal</hi>expressly states the contrary—that the Commons was eminently
		satisfactory.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p104" n="104"/>
          <p>The Board of Trustees found that very few applications were made to them
		for the vacancies in the Faculty. It became necessary to have a committee whose
		duty it was to ascertain by correspondence or otherwise men of sufficient
		learning willing to accept the positions, and with power to employ them. The
		earliest committee was Judge Moore, General Davie, Willie Jones, David Stone
		and Judge John Williams. Afterwards the committee consisted of Hugh Williamson,
		Stone, Thomas H. Blount and Treasurer John Haygood.</p>

          <head>HISTORY OF DAVID KER.</head>
          <p>As Dr. David Ker was first professor, and also, as Presiding Professor,
		the first executive of the University, it is proper to give his subsequent
		history. He lived for several years in Lumberton, Robeson County, engaged in a
		small way in merchandising; also pursuing the study of the law. Among his fast
		friends were a family by the name of Willis, which emigrated to Mississippi,
		and again became his neighbors and allies by marriage. From Lumberton in July,
		1800, he emigrated to the Mississippi Territory, stopping several months with a
		friend in Nashville, Tennessee. He settled finally at Washington in the
		neighborhood of Natchez. He found the people, who had been injured by tobacco
		and indigo, rejoicing in the profits of growing cotton. An industrious planter
		in one year cleared the price of a negro. There was not a considerable school
		in the territory, but many planters had private tutors. He describes the people
		as largely composed of British sympathizers and “Revolutionary
		Tories,” but with a few Republicans. He avows to his correspondent,
		Senator David Stone, his willingness to accept the office of Secretary of
		State, the present incumbent, Col. Steele, being in a languishing state of
		health, or of judge, as Judge Tilton contemplated resignation. He reminds
		Senator Stone that his principles were in harmony with those of President
		Jefferson. His pecuniary resources becoming extremely slender, his wife opened
		a school for girls, in which he was an assistant. The Governor, W. C. C.
		Claiborne, appointed him to the clerkship of the Superior Court of Adams
		County, and soon afterwards he was made Sheriff. He then, <pb xml:id="p105" n="105"/>on the recommendation of Senator Stone, who had years before
		nominated him as Professor of Humanity in our University, received from
		President Jefferson the office of Territorial Judge. He is described as able
		and impartial. His career was short, as he was cut off by disease contracted
		while holding court in an open house without fire in severely cold weather. A
		gentleman who knew him well describes him as a “man of fine education, a
		classical scholar, well read in the principles of moral and natural philosophy,
		of law and religion. His principles were well formed and matured and his moral
		character of the best model, firm, stern, inflexible, unyielding.” His
		wife, whose faith in the Christian religion was steadfast, burnt all his
		writings, lest they might contaminate others. The brave woman continued her
		school and educated her children, who founded some of the leading families of
		Mississippi and Louisiana, many of whose members hold honorable positions in
		their communities. Since the war between the States which brought them nearly
		all to financial ruin, the unmarried women of the family have shown the spirit
		of their first American ancestors, and have devoted themselves with enthusiasm
		to teaching.</p>
          <p>Of the five children of Judge Ker, David died unmarried and Sarah (Mrs.
		Cowden) left no child; Eliza married Mr. Rush Nutt, and has many living
		grandchildren. One is Charles Clark, a prominent lawyer of San Jose,
		California; another is Sargent Prentiss Nutt, once a lawyer of Washington, D.
		C., now a planter near Natchez, at the old homestead, Longwood. Nearly all the
		rest of the Nutt branch are cotton planters in Louisiana or Mississippi.</p>
          <p>Martha (or Patsey) Ker married Mr. Wm. Terry, and left three daughters,
		one of them still living on her plantation on the Yazoo, the widow of William
		B. Prince. Another daughter married Evan Jeffries, a wealthy planter, and their
		descendants are numerous.</p>
          <p>A son of Judge Ker was John Ker, M.D., a surgeon in the Seminole war,
		who was afterwards a successful cotton planter and member of the legislatures
		of Louisiana and Mississippi. He had the religious faith of his mother, who
		lived with him <pb xml:id="p106" n="106"/>until nearly 91 years of age. They are
		both buried at the old homestead, Linden, a mile from Natchez, by the side of
		Judge and David Ker, who were removed from their first resting place.</p>
          <p>Dr. John Ker left six children, all of whom are dead except the two
		youngest, Wm. Henry and Mary S. Ker, who reside in Natchez. The oldest son,
		David, was a lawyer in Louisiana and then a sugar planter. Besides daughters,
		David has a son, J. Brownson Ker, a lawyer in New York City. Two of David Ker's
		daughters are successful teachers in the same city.</p>
          <p>The second son, John Ker, was a lawyer for awhile and then a cotton
		planter. He served throughout the Civil War as Captain of a Louisiana company,
		was captured at Vicksburg. After the war he resumed the profession of the law.
		His son, Wm. B. Ker, is manager of a large sugar estate in Louisiana. One of
		his daughters is the wife of Hon. Murphy J. Foster, once Governor of
		Louisiana.</p>
          <p>Dr. Ker's third son, Lewis Baker Ker, left two sons and four daughters,
		all living in Southern Louisiana.</p>
          <p>The fourth son of Dr. John Ker is still living, Wm. Henry Ker of
		Natchez. He left the Junior class of Harvard to join the Confederate army and
		served throughout as a cavalry soldier in the army of Northern Virginia. After
		the war he undertook cotton planting, but not finding it profitable, adopted
		the profession of teaching and has pursued it with enthusiasm and success. For
		several years he has been Principal of the Natchez White Public Schools,
		President of the State Board of Education, and teacher in and once conductor of
		the Peabody Summer Normals in Mississippi. Harvard lately conferred on him the
		degree of A.B. At Harvard he was the stroke oar of the Harvard crew. He married
		Miss Josephine Chamberlain, and they have a son, John, living and two
		daughters, one of whom married Mr. Richard Butler, a sugar planter of
		Louisiana.</p>
          <p>Dr. John Ker's younger daughter is still living, a fine specimen of the
		noble class of “Old Maids,” Mary S. Ker, who in addition to her
		professional duties, cared for two generations of orphaned nieces and great
		nieces. She has been steadily <pb xml:id="p107" n="107"/>engaged in teaching since
		1871, with the exception of a year and a half spent traveling in Europe. She
		has a place in the faculty of Stanton College, a female school in Natchez. It
		is to her courtesy that I am indebted for much of my information concerning the
		family of Dr. David Ker.</p>

          <head>CHARLES W. HARRIS, PRESIDING PROFESSOR; JOSEPH <lb/>CALDWELL,
		PROFESSOR.</head>
          <p>It can well be imagined that, during the first two terms, or sessions as
		they were called until 1818, the scheme of studies laid down by the committee
		of which Dr. Corckle was chairman, was not closely adhered to. The chaotic
		state of education in the State rendered rigid classification impossible.</p>
          <p>In consequence of the retirement of Dr. Ker, in the summer of 1796, the
		duties of Presiding Professor, in addition to instruction in Mathematics, were
		placed upon the strong but reluctant shoulders of Mr. Harris and there rested
		until his resignation half a year afterwards much against the wishes of the
		Trustees. While so engaged he gave to his work undivided attention, grieving
		however over his abstinence from his law books. Whenever possible he mounted
		his horse, and, riding to Hillsboro, enjoyed refined society in the families of
		the Hoggs, Norwoods, Webbs, and others. Under his management the students
		steadily improved, and at the examination in December showed such proficiency
		that the visiting Trustees published a testimonial thereof.</p>
          <p>As Mr. Harris had given notice that he would retire after the close of
		the term in December, it became necessary to take measures to supply his place.
		He himself, loving the University, took much interest in the question, and was
		freely consulted by the Trustees. Remembering the character and reputation
		<pb xml:id="p108" n="108"/>for ability of Joseph Caldwell, who graduated with
		highest honors at Princeton in the class preceding his, and learning of his
		subsequent success as a tutor, he confidently recommended him for the Chair of
		Mathematics. It was a striking proof of the strong impression he made on the
		eminent men who composed the Board of Trustees, that they unanimously elected
		his nominee. Caldwell had been engaged in teaching mathematics at Princeton,
		was only twenty-three years of age, but of matured intellectual strength. If it
		shall be thought that the Trustees were rash in calling so young a man to so
		responsible a post, it should be remembered that they had a very narrow range
		of choice. The historian, Dr. Hugh Williamson, then residing in New York,
		commissioned by the Board to enquire for persons competent, wrote, “The
		salary offered (about $600) is so small as to preclude any chance of
		inducing any respectable man of learning to remove to a Southern State, where,
		as they all believe, the chances of health are greatly diminished.” He
		says that: “men of moderate ability expect to make more money in other
		business than teaching, hence capable teachers are only among the clergy. The
		Professorship of Mathematics in the College of New Jersey (Princeton) has been
		vacant some time for want of a capable man. It is unfortunate that people
		measure salaries by the inflated price of provisions and the flood of real or
		fictitious money. $2.50 for a bushel of wheat, half a dollar in a tavern
		for breakfast, $1.25 a day for a common laborer, are too high to
		continue. When Europe is revisited by Peace, prices will fall and then we can
		employ teachers on moderate terms.” He advises that tutors be engaged if
		those worthy of being called professors cannot be had.</p>
          <p>By request of the Trustees, Harris apprised Mr. Caldwell that the Chair
		of Mathematics was open to him. Before deciding, the latter asked for a full
		statement of the condition and resources of the University, which was at once
		given minutely and accurately. The following is the substance of this
		answer:</p>
          <p>There were about one hundred students “on the
		establishment,” of whom about sixty were in the Preparatory Department,
		leaving about forty in the University proper. Of the <pb xml:id="p109" n="109"/>
		latter six were in the Moral Philosophy class and fifteen studied Mathematics.
		The Geography and Arithmetic classes had about ten students each, the Latin
		class about the same, and there were five or six in Greek. Each tutor in the
		Grammar School had about thirty. “We imitate,” he writes,
		“Nassau Hall in the conduct of our affairs, as much as circumstances will
		admit. The site at Chapel Hill was selected because of its healthiness. The
		expense of clothing is dearer than at Princeton. Our diet at Commons is
		preferable to yours and at the low rate of $40 a year.” The
		buildings already completed are one wing 98 feet long, containing sixteen
		rooms, “an elegant and large house for the President,” with
		outhouses, the Steward's House, Kitchen, etc. The buildings to be erected are a
		wing similar to the other, a Chapel 50 feet by 40, and a large three-storied
		house 115 feet long and 56 feet broad. The Chapel is contracted for to cost
		$3,000. The Trustees can realize $15,000 more, with which they
		resolve to commence the large building as soon as they can find an undertaker.
		The Treasurer informed him (the writer) that the funds, including what was not
		at once available, could be stated at $30,000. The University labors
		more at the present for the want of good teachers than anything else. If the
		buildings were completed and all the professorships filled there would be 200
		students. The Professorship of Mathematics is worth $500 a year and in a
		short time will be $600. The society in the neighborhood is very
		uncultivated. When there is a little leisure a ride of 12 or 14 miles will find
		agreeable company, and the seminary is occasionally visited by the most
		respectable gentlemen in the State. The newness of the University causes things
		to be in an unsettled state, but he expected that in a short time that a
		situation here would be as agreeable and as profitable as any of a like kind in
		the Union. Mr. Ker left much against his will, and he himself would not wish to
		leave but for the intention to devote himself to the profession of the law. Our
		education at Princeton, he says, was shamefully and inexcusably deficient in
		experimental Philosophy. He expects from London a small apparatus in October.
		He advises that Caldwell should visit Philadelphia and learn the use of the
		different kinds of electrical <pb xml:id="p110" n="110"/>machines, air-pumps,
		telescope, microscope, camera obscura, magic-lantern, quadrants, sextants and
		whatever else may be found useful. He would often have appeared ridiculous in
		his own eyes if he had not gotten a smattering of experimental Philosophy by
		visiting Williamsburg (William and Mary College) in Virginia.</p>
          <p>This fair statement of our University situation procured the acceptance
		by the Princeton tutor of the position tendered him. His determination may have
		been aided by the fact that the College of New Jersey was passing through a
		crisis, the cause of which is not disclosed. In a letter to Davie he stated
		that Dr. McLean, the Professor of Chemistry, from Glasgow, Scotland, whose
		salary was paid out of the private pockets of the Trustees, was in the notion
		of applying for the same chair in North Carolina. Moreover, Brother Smith
		<ref xml:id="ref3" target="#n3">1</ref>
		<note xml:id="n3" anchored="true" target="#ref3">  1 Samuel Stanhope Smith, D.D., President Princeton
			 College.</note>would like to have proposals for a change and would be
		willing to make it if he could have direction of the plan of buildings, and
		their environs. Caldwell significantly adds, “I do not now hesitate to
		say that so far as the reputation of this college depends upon its immediate
		professors, you have an opportunity of transferring it in a great measure to
		the University of your State.” </p>
          <p>But alas! our Trustees did not have the funds adequate to enable them to
		embrace this promising opportunity.</p>
          <p>Joseph Caldwell, the new Professor of Mathematics, was a son of a
		physician of the same name, of Scotch-Irish descent, a resident of Lamington,
		New Jersey, born April 21, 1773, two days after his father's death. His mother
		was Rachel Harker, daughter of a Presbyterian clergyman of note, whose wife was
		a daughter of a Huguenot refugee. Mrs. Rachel Caldwell was a woman of rare
		energy and discretion, instilling into her son good principles, and under many
		privations in troublous times securing for him such educational advantages as
		enabled him to graduate at Princeton in 1791 at the age of 19. In recognition
		of his superior scholarship he was awarded the honor of delivering the Latin
		Salutatory.</p>
          <p>After leaving Princeton, Caldwell entered at once on his life-work as a
		teacher, for a short while having charge of a school <pb xml:id="p111" n="111"/>for
		young children, then for a year or so being usher, or assistant, in a classical
		academy at Elizabethtown. His intelligence and faithfulness were so conspicuous
		in this position that in April, 1795, he was chosen to be tutor in his alma
		mater, having for his associate and life-long friend, John Henry Hobart.</p>
          <p>While performing their duties as teachers both these tutors were
		pursuing theological studies. They soon parted, one going North to become
		famous as Protestant Episcopal Bishop of New York, the other coming South to
		become eminent as a preacher in the Presbyterian Church, exerting still wider
		influence as Professor and President of a State University.</p>
          <p>Caldwell was licensed to preach the gospel while at Princeton by the
		Presbytery of New Brunswick. Afterwards, when on his way to Chapel Hill, he
		stopped in Philadelphia and preached in the church of the celebrated divine,
		Dr. Ashbel Green. His sermon made such a strong impression on the audience that
		he was virtually offered the charge of an important congregation. Dr. Green
		prevented any possibility of his yielding to this tempting invitation,
		extremely attractive to a young man of twenty-three years of age, by saying
		abruptly, “Mr. Caldwell is on his way to Carolina and to Carolina he is
		certainly to go. To speak of other places will be in vain.” The splendid
		career of usefulness pursued by his young friend, is proof of the pious wisdom
		of this great man in inculcating respect for the sanctity of a contract.</p>
          <p>On September 6, 1796, Professor Harris wrote to Caldwell expressing the
		great pleasure the tidings of his acceptance gives him, regretting that Dr.
		Smith is not agreeably situated at Princeton, and promising to suggest to our
		Trustees to endeavor to make his removal to this University profitable and
		agreeable. He advised relinquishment of the idea of coming by water. To travel
		by public stage would cost $50, before reaching Petersburg, 170 miles
		from Chapel Hill. The best plan is to purchase a small, but good, horse and a
		single chair, (i. e. two-wheeled sulky, holding one person). A half-worn chair,
		if well made, would answer the purpose. With this traveling would be as
		expeditious as on horseback. In the chair-box could be carried many
		necessaries. This could be made <pb xml:id="p112" n="112"/>cheap and healthful, and
		would occupy about thirty days. By adhering to the post-route through the
		cities of Washington, Alexandria, passing near Mount Vernon, Richmond,
		Petersburg, etc., much entertainment and knowledge of geography would be
		gained. The loss on re-sale of the horse would not be considerable. Let Mr.
		Caldwell fill his trunk with one or two pieces of linen, stockings, shoes,
		broadcloth, and whatever clothing will be needed for a year, as these things
		are dearer here than in Philadelphia and often not procurable. Trunks should be
		sent by water to Petersburg, Virginia, in the care of Grain and Anderson, who
		will pay charges and forward them on to Hillsboro at once.</p>
          <p>A more striking contrast between the old time and the new can hardly be
		shown. The solitary professor journeying in all kinds of weather in the open
		air, occupying over a month, and trusting his baggage by a devious and
		uncertain route to a point 12 miles from Chapel Hill, while the modern
		professor makes the trip in comfort, even luxury, his baggage accompanying him,
		in less than twenty-four hours, and does not have a broken-down horse and a
		worn-out vehicle on his hands at the end of his journey.</p>
          <p>Even before the advent of railroad transportation the rapidity of travel
		greatly increased. In June, 1821, Rev. Wm. Hooper wrote to his wife from New
		York City: “It is astonishing to think that I should have left you Friday
		morning and on the following Tuesday be in New York, 600 miles distant.”
		His route was first to Petersburg or Richmond, thence down the river to
		Norfolk, thence by sea to his destination. I remark in passing that the good
		doctor offered to preach on Sunday but the Captain, ascertaining that his
		passengers objected, declined to allow him.</p>
          <p>Fortunately Dr. Caldwell kept copies of many of his letters, and by the
		kindness of his step-son and executor these are in the archives of the
		University. He had, according to the fashion of the day, quite a diffuse style,
		and I take the liberty of giving often the substance of what appears to be of
		historic value.</p>
          <p>One of the most interesting of these letters was written to a
		<pb xml:id="p113" n="113"/>“Rev. Sir” soon after his reaching Chapel
		Hill. He says, “I arrived on the 31st October (1796) and on the second
		day after entered on the business of the class. The University is almost
		entirely in infancy, cut out of the woods, one building of the smaller kind is
		finished. The Trustees are endeavoring to get an undertaker for the largest,
		115 by 56 feet. The foundation of the Chapel is laid but the completion is
		uncertain, as the mason and his negroes have spent the favorable fall in
		raising the foundation to the surface of the ground. According to agreement it
		must be finished by the 1st day of July next. The Trustees offer for the
		completion of the large building 10,000 or 12,000 pounds ($20 or
		$24,000). The President's house is well finished. It is one hundred
		yards from the nearest building of the University.</p>
          <p>Soon after his arrival he made a trip to Raleigh. “The Legislature
		in numbers appeared respectable. General Davie stands foremost and an almost
		unrivaled leader in every capital enterprise.” He spent the greater part
		of two evenings with Davie and pronounced him “a man of good abilities
		and active in every measure for promoting the honor and interest of the
		State.” “In the Legislature he seems like a parent struggling for
		the happiness and welfare of his children. No doubt he frequently finds them
		refractory.”</p>
          <p>The youthful professor, having had a few days view of this State of over
		50,000 square miles, felt qualified to tell all about its people. He said,
		“The State appears to be swarming with lawyers. It is almost the only
		profession for which parents educate their children. Religion is so little in
		vogue, that it affords no temptation to undertake its cause. In New Jersey it
		had a public respect and support. In North Carolina, and particularly in the
		part east of Chapel Hill, every one believes that the way of rising to
		respectability is to disavow as often and as publicly as possible the leading
		doctrines of the Scriptures. They are bugbears, very well fitted to scare the
		ignorant and weak into obedience to the laws; but the laws of morality and
		honor are sufficient to regulate the conduct of men of letters and cultivated
		reasons. One reason, why religion is so scouted from the most influential part
		of society, is that it is taught only <pb xml:id="p114" n="114"/>by ranters, with
		whom it seems to consist only in the powers of their throats and the wildness
		and madness of their gesticulations and distortions. If it could be regularly
		taught by men of prudence, real piety and improved talents it would claim the
		support of the people.”</p>
          <p>It is amazing that a man of sense, as Caldwell certainly was, should
		have expressed such positive convictions when he had so little means of forming
		a judgment. A letter from his friend, John Henry Hobart, then Tutor at
		Princeton, gives us further insight into his views of things at Chapel Hill and
		elsewhere. Hobart was pleased to see that “Caldwell's disagreeable
		feelings were wearing off. The country must have presented a barren and gloomy
		prospect, and the manners of the lower class congenial to it, except where the
		noise of intemperate mirth gave liveliness to the dull scene. I have understood
		that in Virginia especially the rich planters are men of hospitality and
		polished manners. It is to be hoped that the rays from your University, the Sun
		of Science, will illuminate the darkness of society. Your Faculty seems to
		constitute a motley group. Presbyterians and Arians, infidels and Roman
		Catholics. The <hi rend="italics">age of reason</hi>has surely come.
		Superstition and bigotry are buried in one common grave. Philosophy and charity
		begin to bless the people.”</p>
          <p>“I expected something better from Harris. I did not expect that he
		would become the disciple of infidelity. I feel for your situation thus
		deprived of religious conversation and society, exposed to the insults of the
		profane and scoffs of the infidel. Your resolution to stand firm is worthy of
		your profession. Providence seems to have placed you in a position where you
		will need much firmness, but where you may do much good. It seems as if you
		were called to proclaim the glorious truths of the Gospel, where they have not
		been known, or known only to the contemned.” Hobart then tells of the
		losses of the Federalists in Pennsylvania and hopes that by “the aid of
		Webster's and Fenno's papers you will be able to make good Federalists of some
		of your North Carolina friends.” This Webster was the author of the
		Unabridged Dictionary who once edited a political journal.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p115" n="115"/>
          <p>It appears from a letter by Thomas Y. How to Caldwell that the latter
		had a conversation with Davie on the Evidences of Christianity. He gave to How
		a summary of his arguments, which were pronounced, judicious and forcible.
		Nothing is said of the impression made on the mind of Davie. How is alarmed at
		the progress of infidelity. He believes that the French government sends
		emissaries to the United States to convert the people to Deism in order to make
		them lose their Republican virtue, and then France by intrigue and bribery can
		control their policy.</p>
          <p>We have Davie's impressions of Caldwell, formed after a six months'
		acquaintance. “The more I know Caldwell the more I am pleased with him. I
		think him a respectable character and well qualified to fill the Mathematical
		and Natural Philosophy chairs. Perhaps he has not studied attentively Moral
		Philosophy and the Belles Lettres, but I believe him possessed of talent
		sufficient to attain to any proficiency in any science that may be necessary. I
		am very sorry that he has notified his determination to leave us. He seems to
		think that his constitution is too weak to undergo the anxiety and fatigue of
		the President's place.” It will be seen that this intention was
		abandoned.</p>
          <p>Mr. Caldwell, after resting only one day, began his duties as professor
		on the 2d of November, 1796, Harris having the duties of Presiding Professor.
		When in accordance with his notification the latter's resignation took effect,
		Caldwell, with great reluctance, succeeded him in the management, Rev. Samuel
		A. Holmes, who had been Tutor, being elevated to the Professorship of
		Languages, W. A. Richards being teacher of French and German. The Preparatory
		Department was under the management of Nicholas Delvaux, assisted by
		Richards.</p>
          <p>I give briefly the career of the excellent Professor Harris after his
		leaving the University. He settled in Halifax, one of the court towns, arriving
		there April 10, 1797. He was spared the usual dreary waiting of a young
		practitioner. General Davie was elected Governor in the fall of the same year,
		and in the next was sent, together with Chief Justice Ellsworth and Van Murray,
		our minister to the Hague, to negotiate with Napoleon <pb xml:id="p116" n="116"/>
		for peace with France. He intrusted the bulk of his practice to Harris, so that
		the public soon learned his worth. In 1800 he was elected a Trustee of the
		University, and being placed on the Visiting Committee aided in conducting the
		examinations in June of that year. His legal abilities were so generally
		recognized that he was urged by his Federalist friends to allow his name to go
		before the General Assembly for the office of Judge, but he declined on account
		of bad health. Hoping for relief he made a voyage to the West Indies in 1803,
		but finding no benefit, returned and died January 15, 1804, at the residence of
		his brother, Robert Wilson Harris, in Sneedsboro, on the Pee Dee in the county
		of Anson. Before his death he returned to the faith of his father, an elder in
		the Presbyterian church at Poplar Tent. He was agreeable with his friends,
		reserved among strangers, scrupulously truthful and honorable, an assiduous and
		accomplished scholar. Seldom has pulmonary consumption carried off a more
		promising man.</p>
          <p>Under the judicious management of Caldwell the spring term of 1797 moved
		on harmoniously and prosperously to all outward seeming, though we learn from
		his letters that he was not pleased with some of his associates.</p>
          <p>The cares incident to the office of Acting President so weighed upon Mr.
		Caldwell that, as Davie wrote, he avowed his intention to leave the
		institution. The Trustees, however, induced him to remain by the election at
		the close of 1797 of James Smiley Gillaspie as Professor of Natural Philosophy,
		to be also Presiding Professor.</p>
          <p>The examination of July 18, 1797, was quite numerously attended by the
		Trustees, there being present Governor Benjamin Williams, Judge John Williams,
		James Hogg, Adlai Osborne, Willie Jones and Walter Alves. Their report was most
		favorable. “The Professors and Tutors deserve praise and thanks, and the
		students approbation and applause, and both were accordingly given by the
		Trustees.” “Rosy health appeared in the countenances of the
		students, a few boys excepted, who came from the eastern parts of the
		State.” “The complaints which have existed against the Steward have
		entirely subsided.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p117" n="117"/>
          <p>We have a letter from James Hogg to General Davie, explaining that the
		duty of attending the Board of Trustees and the necessity of leaving for home
		on the fifth day caused a too meagre attention to the examination of the
		classes of the Preparatory Department. He reports that “Mr. Delvaux's
		classes on Sallust, Cæsar, Cornelius Nepos, Eutropius and two classes on
		Corderius seemed to me to be taught with accuracy. It is true that they had
		been prepared, but each student drew by lot the chapter or section which he was
		to read. His students in the French Grammar were satisfactory. He has a class
		in the Latin Grammar which was not examined.”</p>
          <p>“Mr. Richard's classes on Telemaque and Gil Blas, French exercises
		and in French Grammar made a satisfactory examination. A large class on the
		common rules of Arithmetic and practice and a large class in English Grammar in
		general performed well.” There were two classes in reading and spelling
		but there was not time to test the proficiency of the students. Davie wrote
		that he feared that sufficient attention is not paid to reading and spelling.
		He has heard complaint of the school in this regard, especially in the
		northeast section of the State.</p>
          <p>“A man of prominent character is necessary in the Grammar
		School.” He is sorry to hear of the differences between Delvaux and
		Richards. They can be met by appointment of an additional Tutor. Robert Moore
		is recommended, also Archibald D. Murphey, from Caswell. Moore would probably
		teach for his board and tuition. Davie adds, “It is so difficult to find
		men for our purpose tolerably well qualified, that I am very sorry that Mr.
		Delvaux is to leave us. It is not likely that we shall meet with his
		equal.”</p>
          <p>We are informed in this report that Caldwell, in addition to his duties
		in the University proper, taught about twenty pupils in the Preparatory
		Department in reading.</p>
          <p>Hogg's explanation of the chapters, to be examined on, having been
		notified in advance to the students reminds me that when seven years of age I
		was at the school of Mrs. Harriet Bobbitt in Louisburg; she, apparently as a
		matter of course, gave to the pupils the words which we were to spell at the
		public examinations by the Trustees. The result was more favorable
		<pb xml:id="p118" n="118"/>to the accuracy of the spelling than to the moral lesson
		inculcated. I very much fear that similar deceptions were not uncommon in
		“the good old days.” It is remarkable that there are in the
		archives of the University two valedictory orations in Caldwell's handwriting,
		and a third endorsed as copied by E. J. Osborne for him, which seems to imply
		that he supplied members of the graduating classes with productions similar to
		those which he had listened to with tearful eyes at Princeton. His unbending
		rectitude of principle leads to the conclusion that the matter was well
		understood by the students and the public. I conjecture that similar deceptions
		are not uncommon in our day. I have been occasionally requested by pupils of
		distant schools to supply them with “original speeches,” one of
		them naming the subject—“Love, the Causes of Love, the Effects of
		Love,” etc., but I have invariably declined.</p>

          <head>THE PRINCIPALSHIP OF GILLASPIE.</head>
          <p>The new Professor of Natural Philosophy, James Smiley Gillaspie, as he
		spelt his name, was honored with the title of Principal of the University,
		instead of Presiding Professor. He was son of John Gillaspie, doubtless a near
		relative of Col. Daniel Gillaspie, of the Revolution, and Senator from
		Guilford. His home was at Martinsville, a village which took the place of old
		Guilford Court-House. By inducing him to assume executive duties and by
		adopting a resolution endorsing Caldwell's course, the Trustees induced the
		latter to accept the Chair of Mathematics. He voluntarily agreed to teach
		French in the Preparatory Department, for which an allowance of $30 was
		made.</p>
          <p>The first year of Gillaspie's administration was fairly successful. His
		colleagues were Caldwell and Holmes in the University, and Richards and William
		Edwards Webb, a promising member of the Senior class, in the Grammar

          <head>EARLY DONATIONS—GOVERNOR SMITH.</head>
          <p>I have chronicled the fact that Governor Smith offered to the University
		warrants for 20,000 acres of soldiers' land warrants at the first meeting of
		the Board in 1789, and handed over the warrants at the second meeting in
		1790.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p119" n="119"/>
          <p>The munificence of Colonel, afterwards Governor and General Smith
		brought, however, no present funds into the treasury. The warrants were for
		lands located in Obion County, in the extreme northwest of Tennessee. By the
		treaty of Hopewell in 1785 the United States ceded this territory to the
		Chickasaw Indians. In 1810 one of the most terrific earthquakes which ever
		afflicted the Mississippi Valley turned portions of the land into lakelets. It
		was not until twenty-five years afterwards that a sale was effected, which
		realized $14,000. Nevertheless it was certainly a graceful act to name
		our library building Smith Hall in his honor, although it was delayed over half
		a century. John Harvard gained immortality by a legacy of less than
		$4,000 to the college at Newton, afterwards Cambridge, in Massachusetts.
		I feel it a duty to give the man, who made a much more munificent donation to
		our infant institution, this special notice.</p>
          <p>Benjamin Smith was a man of force. In the Revolutionary struggle he was
		a special aid to Washington in the masterly retreat from Long Island. He
		partook of the glory in defeating Parker's fleet at Charleston. In
		contemplation of war with England or France, when his great chief was
		President, he was made Brigadier-General of militia. When a struggle with
		France was imminent, during the Presidency of elder Adams, the entire militia
		force of Brunswick volunteered after a fiery speech from him. In 1810, when the
		troubles with England were culminating he was made General of the county
		forces. He was fifteen times State Senator from his county of Brunswick. The
		capital of the county was called in his honor Smithville. With forgetfulness of
		the old hero and hankering after modern sheckels, the name has been changed to
		Southport. His memory is still perpetuated not alone by the gratitude of the
		University, but by the name of the bleak island, which far out in the ocean
		forms the dangerous projection of shifting sand, called by the ancient mariner
		in his terror <foreign xml:lang="lat">Promontorium Tremendum</foreign>, or Cape
		Fear.</p>
          <p>As he advanced in years Governor Smith lost his health by high living
		and his fortune by too generous suretyship. He became irascible and prone to
		resent fancied slights. His <pb xml:id="p120" n="120"/>tongue became venomous to
		opponents. He once spoke with undeserved abusiveness of Judge Alfred Moore, and
		the insult was avenged by one of the members of the Assembly from Brunswick,
		Judge Moore's son Maurice, who next to Hinton James was one of the first
		students of the University. The duel was fought on the 28th June, 1805, in
		South Carolina, not far from the seaside, where then stood the Boundary House,
		the line running thro' the centre of the hall entrance. When North Carolina
		officers sent in pursuit reached the house they were unable to cross the
		imaginary line into the south side of the house, where the duellists and their
		friends, triumphant under the jurisdiction of South Carolina, were laughing
		over their fruitless chase. The second of Captain Maurice Moore was his cousin,
		Major Duncan Moore, while General Smith was attended by General Joseph Gardner
		Swift, whose “Memoirs,” published only for private circulation and
		re-published by the University in the James Sprunt Historical Monographs, is of
		much interest. At the second fire the bullet of Moore entered the side of
		Smith, and although not fatal was long the cause of pain and discomfort. When
		some years after his death his bones were exhumed for removal to another
		cemetery, the “vengeful lead” was found among them.</p>
          <p>It is sad to relate that in his old age he was arrested by the attorney
		of the University, who, Smith alleged, was his personal enemy, and held for a
		security debt; but on learning the fact he was released by order of the
		Trustees with promptness. Even after his death, it is said, his body was
		pursued by hungry creditors, a ghastly power then allowed by law, and his
		friends were forced to bury it in the darkness of night in an obscure spot,
		where the money ghouls could not find it.</p>

          <head>GENERAL PERSON.</head>
          <p>About the time of the construction of the old East, the old Chapel, or
		Person Hall, was begun. When funds ran low the hearts of the Trustees were
		gladdened by the gift of $1,050 in “hard money,” said to
		have been paid in shining silver dollars, for the purpose of finishing it, by
		General Thomas Person, of Granville. He was an old bachelor, who, not having
		children <pb xml:id="p121" n="121"/>of his own, felt impelled to help educate those
		of others. General Person was a wealthy planter of Granville County. He was a
		sympathizer with the Regulators in their wrongs, but did not approve their
		overt resistance. He was an active patriot of the Revolution—a delegate
		to the first assembly of the people at New Bern in 1774, which met in defiance
		of the prohibition of the royal Governor. He appeared again as a member of the
		Provincial Congress at Hillsboro in 1775, and of the Congress at the same place
		in the spring of 1776, by which the State was organized for war, and which led
		the van in authorizing the members of the Continental Congress to vote for
		independence. He was one of the stout patriots who amid the storms of war
		framed a constitution for free North Carolina at Halifax in December, 1776. He
		was the second named of the large and able committee which reported the
		Constitution for the consideration of the body, and did their work so well that
		no changes were made in it. Nor was he trusted as a legislator only. He was one
		of the Provincial Council, which constituted the Provisional government of the
		State prior to the Constitution, and of the Council of Safety, which was its
		successor. He was one of the six Brigadier-Generals of the first military
		establishment. He was a member of the House of Commons during the entire war,
		and either as Senator or Commoner represented Granville County in the General
		Assembly for sixteen years. He always enjoyed the esteem and confidence of our
		people. He was always a fast friend of education and of the University. He was
		among the influential men who formed the first Board of Trustees. He attended
		the first meeting of the Trustees in 1790 at Fayetteville. For many years the
		“Old Chapel” was the place of divine worship and of all public
		meetings. For some time the two societies held therein their sessions. It
		witnessed the Commencement exercises and conferring the diplomas. Until after
		our great Civil War these documents bore on their face in sonorous Latin the
		antiquated words, “<foreign xml:lang="lat">in Aula
		Personica</foreign>.” The grateful Trustees directed that a slab be
		inserted in front of the building with the following inscription:</p>

          <p>On January 9, 1793, Willie Jones and Wm. R. Davie, the leaders of the
		Republican and Federalist parties in the eastern section, in politics opposed,
		but personal friends, issued a joint appeal for subscriptions, stating that

		to promote the prosperity and happiness of the people. They hope that
		“the gentlemen of the county of Halifax, on an occasion so interesting to
		the rising generation, when the gentlemen of the county of Orange had given

          <p>In the appendix will be found the list of names—a veritable roll
		of honor. The subscriptions run all the way from $5 to $200. Wm.
		Cain, of Orange, Alfred Moore, of Brunswick, soon to be a Judge, and Walter
		Alves, of Orange, were the <pb xml:id="p123" n="123"/>largest subscribers. The
		latter, however, added his own donation to a legacy willed by his father-in-law
		in order to make up the $200. He was a son of James Hogg, changing his
		name at his father's request. The $100 subscribers were Jesse Nevill, of
		Orange; Wm. R. Davie, Willie Jones and Nicholas Long, of Halifax; John Burgwin,
		of Wilmington; Governor Spaight, Joseph Leech, Daniel Carthy, George Pollock,
		and Wilson Blount, of New Bern. In the lists will be found ancestors of many of
		the leading citizens of the State and friends of the University, such as the
		Spaights, Donnells, Bryans, Davises, Blounts, Greens, Osbornes, Halls, Moores,
		Ashes, Kenans, Burgwins, Wrights, Toomers, Joneses, Cutlars, Jameses, Hills,
		Dudleys, Sneads, Waddells, Haywoods, Alstons, Malletts, Longs, Whitakers,
		Smiths, Watters, Hooper, Strayhorns, Renchers, Johnstons, and many others, not
		couting those on the female side.</p>
          <p>It is particularly gratifying to see the name of Wm. Bingham, the
		founder of the distinguished family of teachers in our State, who gave
		$20, a large sum for a teacher, then a recent settler among us. Rev. Dr.
		Samuel E. McCorkle showed his interest by procuring $42 from his
		congregation. The Central Benevolent Association, of Iredell County, subscribed
		$100 for the purchase of books and apparatus, and Rev. James Hall, D.D.,
		the Preacher-Captain in the Revolution, out of his meagre salary sent
		$5.</p>
          <p>It is evident that two or more of the agents procuring subscriptions
		neglected their duty. It is impossible to believe that so many well-to-do
		counties around Albemarle Sound and in the valleys of the Tar, the Neuse above
		Craven, the Pee Dee, the Catawba, the Yadkin, and other rivers, would have been
		totally unrepresented in this list if they had been properly canvassed. We
		should give all the more praise to James Hogg, W. R. Davie, Richard Dobb
		Spaight, Alfred Moore and Wm. H. Hill for successful activity. Wm. Barry Grove
		would have undoubtedly gathered a larger sum if he had not been engaged in his
		congressional duties.</p>
          <p>The foregoing subscriptions were not, however, payable at once, but
		according to the dates fixed by the donors—mostly in one or two
		years.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p124" n="124"/>
          <p>Besides these, were subscriptions of $460 in Wake and $80
		in Rowan, under the provision in the charter authorizing donors of $20
		to have a four years' free scholarship. In 1796 the Trustees cancelled all
		these. It should be added that the first donor of apparatus for instruction was
		Alfred Moore, then called Colonel, a pair of globes; and next to him was
		Richard Bennehan.</p>

          <head>MAJOR GERRARD.</head>
          <p>In 1798 the Trustees were gladdened by the bequest of valuable lands and
		land warrants in Tennessee by a worthy Revolutionary officer, a Lieutenant in
		the Fifth Battalion of the Continental line, whose first Colonel was Edward
		Buncombe. His name was Charles Gerrard, a native of Carteret County, but at his
		death a citizen of Edgecombe, married, though childless. He was described in
		the <hi rend="italics">North Carolina Journal</hi>“as a soldier brave,
		active and persevering, and justly admired as a citizen, husband, friend and
		neighbor.” His rank as Lieutenant entitled him to a grant of 2,560 acres
		which he located in 1783 at the junction of Yellow Creek with Cumberland River,
		not far below the city of Nashville.</p>
          <p>This tract, the fruit of his toil and suffering and blood, he regarded
		with peculiar affection, and when he bequeathed it he requested in his will
		that it should perpetually remain the property of the University. For
		thirty-five years the Trustees regarded this wish as sacred.</p>
          <p>The spelling given is according to the original will of Major Gerrard.
		Judges Gaston and Badger, in reporting the hereafter mentioned resolutions,
		adopt it. Afterwards the name was wrongly confounded with that of the founder
		of Girard College.</p>
          <p>In addition to this tract, which was called his “service
		right,” Gerrard bequeathed warrants which he had purchased amounting to
		11,364 acres. The story of the sale of these will be told hereafter.</p>

		order.</p>

          <pb xml:id="p125" n="125"/>
          <head>THE SOUTH, OR MAIN BUILDING.</head>
          <p>The first Trustees planned to have one long building facing the East, as
		Orientalization was the fashion in architecture. From its centre as I have
		mentioned stretched a broad avenue to Piney (or Point, as it was then called)
		Prospect. From want of funds the northern wing only was first erected. What is
		now called the Old West Building was intended to be the southern wing of the
		larger central structure. The whole was to be exactly similar to the Insane
		Asylum which overlooks Raleigh from Dix Hill. The design was to finish first
		the northern wing, afterwards called the East, and now Old East, then the Main
		Building and finally the north wing. This explanation somewhat excuses the sale
		of lots on the north side of the campus. The University was to have a double
		front eastward and westward.</p>
          <p>When Professors Harris and Caldwell entered the Faculty, with such
		influential Princetonians as McCorkle, Davie, and Stone in the Board of
		Trustees, this plan gave way to the orthodox idea of a quadrangle, which in
		England and Scotland is, with more or less efficiency, a veritable prison for
		detention of students at night; and the name “Main” in course of
		time gave way to South, the name “Wing” to East, and the University
		now fronted north. About 1830, under the influence of Dr. Elisha Mitchell, an
		abortive attempt was made to turn the front to the south, and hence the useless
		south porch to Gerrard Hall.</p>
          <p>In 1798, emboldened by the donation of Major Gerrard, the Trustees
		concluded to begin the erection of the Main Building, and the cornerstone was
		laid. Its walls reached the height of a story and a half, and then remained
		roofless for years.</p>
          <p>The cornerstone was laid, as had been that of the Old East with Masonic
		ceremonies. The following is the entry on the Journals of the Grand Lodge
		located in Raleigh:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“On the 14th of April, 1798, by order of its most worshipful Grand
		Master, a special Grand Lodge was called at the University of North Carolina
		for the express purpose of laying the foundation and cornerstone of the
		principal college of that seminary and to join the Trustees of the University
		in one ejaculation to heaven and the Great Architect of the universe for the
		<pb xml:id="p126" n="126"/>auspices of His eternal goodness and for the prosperity
		of learning, wisdom and virtue of that college.”</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>LOTTERIES.</head>
          <p>In order to complete the Main Building the Trustees obtained from the
		Legislature of 1801 the liberty of raising, by one or more lotteries, not
		exceeding 2,000 pounds ($4,000). The public conscience of that day saw
		no harm in calling in the aid of the Goddess Fortuna for promoting religion,
		education, or any other desirable end. The following was the plan of the
		University lottery No. 1: There were 1,500 tickets, costing $5 each. Of
		these 531 bore prizes and 969 blanks. There was one prize each for
		$1,500, $500, $250, $200, two of $100 each,
		five of $50 each, ten of $10 each, and five hundred of $5
		each. The $250 prize was to belong to the last drawn ticket. The prizes
		aggregated $5,500, leaving a net profit of $2,000. The drawing
		was had under the superintendence of State officers, Wm. White, Secretary of
		State, and John Craven, Comptroller. The highest prize was drawn by ticket No.
		1138, held by General Lawrence Baker, grandfather of a Confederate General of
		the same name.</p>
          <p>The scheme of the second lottery drawn in 1802 was as follows: 
		<q direct="unspecified"><p><list type="simple"><item>There was 1 prize of $1,000</item><item>1 prize of 500</item><item>2 prize of 250</item><item>1 prize of 100</item></list></p></q>to be the first-drawn ticket of the last day of

          </p>
          <p>The foregoing is the scheme as stated in the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh
		Register.</hi>As the prizes foot up $14,000 it is to be presumed that
		the University retained a large number of tickets and participated in
		<pb xml:id="p127" n="127"/>the drawing. At any rate the net amount to the
		University Treasury was $2,865.36. The net amount from the first lottery
		was $2,215.45. The whole amount was, therefore, $5,080.81.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable how completely public sentiment has changed on the
		subject of lotteries. The hostility to them seems to tend towards driving them
		from their last refuge, Church Fairs. In 1802 the best men lent their names and
		active aid to them. I have in my collections an autograph of George Washington,
		date not given, signed to a lottery ticket. In order to induce our citizens to
		buy the tickets of the University lotteries, batches of them were placed in the
		hands of Trustees and other friends of the institution, who were expected to
		use their personal influence to procure purchasers. We have copies of these
		letters of transmission. One is signed by Henry Potter, Judge of the District
		Court of the United States, Henry Seawell, State Senator and afterwards
		Superior Court Judge, John Haywood, State Treasurer, and Wm. Polk, President of
		the State Bank. They assert that “the interests of the University of
		North Carolina, and of Learning and Science generally throughout our State, are
		concerned in the immediate sale of the tickets.” They continue with
		delicate flattery: “From a belief that no measure calculated to promote
		the prosperity and happiness of our country is indifferent to you, this request
		is made.”</p>
          <p>In order to inspire confidence, the proceeds of sale were to be sent to
		Benjamin Williams, who was not only Governor but a man of character and wealth.
		With a sense of propriety characteristic of the old school of gentlemen his
		official title is omitted.</p>
          <p>The Commissioners of the second lottery were Messrs. Polk, Haywood and
		Potter. They state that the want of punctuality, in making returns by some of
		the agents for sale of the tickets in the first lottery, had occasioned
		“much difficulty, delay and embarrassment in the course of the
		drawing.” Those who performed their duty have the satisfaction that
		“their patriotic and well-meant endeavors have proved effectual and have
		already brightened the prospects of this institution, and of our
		<pb xml:id="p128" n="128"/>country throughout, so far as depends on a general
		diffusion of Learning and Science.” The Commissioners are sanguine in
		their expectations of this mode of raising money, “however illy it may
		comport with the wealth and dignity of the State.”</p>
          <p>The slowness with which the returns were made met with the stern
		denunciation of the Treasurer, Gavin Alves, son of James Hogg, who had by act
		of Assembly adopted his mother's name. In a letter to the Commissioners he
		accuses the “backward gentlemen” of shameful neglect of the trust
		reposed in them. He asks leave to threaten public exposure. At any rate
		“if neither sense of shame nor regard to propriety can actuate them I
		must try what incessant importunity will do.”</p>
          <p>I find a third lottery advertised, identical with the second, but the
		project was abandoned. More than was allowed by the act of Assembly had already
		been realized.</p>
          <p>It is painful to be compelled to record that $300 of lottery No.
		1 and $604 of lottery No. 2 had not been returned by the agents of the
		University, mostly Trustees, as late as December, 1803. Measures were taken to
		notify delinquents that those not accounting within six months should have
		their names published in the newspapers. It was afterwards ascertained that
		those charged with the value of tickets intrusted to them for sale had failed
		to dispose of the same, so that it was a case of carelessness, not fraud.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>APPEALS FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS—DONATIONS.</head>
          <p>In February, 1803, the lottery money not being sufficient to finish the
		Main Building, efforts were made to raise additional funds by subscription.
		Col. Polk, President of the Board, issued an appeal deploring the necessity of
		beholding its exposed and roofless walls and the almost naked shelves of the
		Library. He urged all “Patriots to come to the rescue, because no country
		can long remain free unless its religious, civil and political rights are
		understood by the mass of its citizens.” “Every one contributing
		even one volume toward improving the minds of youths, who are to succeed us on
		the stage of life, must feel a self-approbation. On these youths the character
		and fate of our country depends.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p129" n="129"/>
          <p>A Trustee for each Judicial District was appointed for the receipt of
		contributions for the increase of the library, as well as finishing the
		building, and as those considered most active in behalf of the University were
		appointed I give their names: Robert Montgomery, Senator from Hertford for the
		Edenton District; Calvin Jones, a physician of Wake County of reputation and
		public spirit; Joshua G. Wright, Commoner from Wilmington, Speaker of the
		House, soon to be Judge in the Wilmington District; Charles W. Harris, late
		Presiding Professor of the University, of Halifax District; Duncan Cameron,
		Commoner from Orange, soon to be a Judge, of the Hillsboro District; Nathaniel
		Alexander, late Senator from Mecklenburg, a member of Congress and soon to be
		Governor, of the Salisbury District; Wm. Barry Grove, Member of Congress, of
		the Fayetteville District; and Wallace Alexander, late Senator from Lincoln, of
		the Morgan District.</p>
          <p>The appeal was not greatly successful. $1,664 was raised in cash.
		Some of the Trustees appointed seem not to have acted. Charles W. Harris had
		the seeds of consumption and was soon to start on his trip to the West Indies
		in the vain effort to escape his foe. Wallace Alexander about this time closed
		his honored life. The most active Trustees were primarily Wm. Polk, and after
		him Robert Montgomery and Durant Hatch, of Jones County. Col. Polk was not only
		successful in procuring donations from others, fifty in number, but gave
		$100 himself. Among the fifty are some notable names. Judge Cameron,
		William Norwood, Henry Potter, Emmanuel Shober, William Peace, John D. Hawkins,
		Robert Williams, Judge John Hall, Theophilus Hunter, Wm. Creecy, Sherwood and
		William Henry Haywood, and many other citizens of Wake and adjoining counties.
		John Spence West, of Craven, was likewise active and raised $80 in
		addition to his own subscription of $20. Ex-Governor Samuel Johnston,
		who had that year resigned his judgeship, donated $100.</p>
          <p>On July 3, 1803, the Trustees concluded to ask again for funds for the
		completion of “the Principal Building.” An eloquent address was
		issued, prepared evidently by Governor Martin. They claimed that literary
		institutions are the grand security <pb xml:id="p130" n="130"/>of our liberties and
		that from them in great measure all civil and religious information flows, that
		they qualify young citizens to discharge their political duties with honor and
		reputation. The Trustees boast with honest pride that heretofore their
		guardianship has not been in vain. The aids amply supplied by the acts
		establishing the University have been taken away. This caused the disagreeable
		necessity of resorting to lotteries, “a mode not the most honorable of
		raising money for the institution.” The money thus raised has been
		invested in stocks of the Bank of the United States, “not to be drawn
		upon but under a pressing emergency.” The people were exhorted to equal
		in generosity that recently shown by private donations and legislative
		endowments in several of the United States. The success of this movement is
		elsewhere shown.</p>
          <p>We learn from Governor Stone that in 1800 another Representative in
		Congress who was an active Trustee, William Barry Grove, of Fayetteville, had
		procured, with funds placed in his hands for the purpose, an electrical
		apparatus, and that Governor Martin, then Senator of the United States, had
		ordered as a gift a new telescope. About the same time the excellent body of
		Christians, the Unitas Fratrum, or Moravians, through Frederick William
		Marshall and Gotlieb Shober, donated $200 in cash. And then there was in
		1802 a gift of new pair of globes. The letter accompanying the gift was written
		by Mrs. Winifred Gales, wife of Joseph Gales, the editor of the
		<hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register,</hi>who was one of the contributors, but
		whose name was not signed to the letter for some reason, possibly because her
		husband edited the Republican organ, the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh
		Register,</hi>and the University was accused of being a Federalist
		institution. The letter was published in the <hi rend="italics">Minerva</hi>or
		<hi rend="italics">Anti-Jacobin,</hi>the organ of the Federalists. As a good
		sample of the stately style of the old days I give it complete:</p>

          <p>In his reply Caldwell refers pointedly to the unpopularity of the
		institution, while claiming that it was unfounded. “The
		University,” he says, “early excited expectations which were
		unfortunately too sanguine and premature to be realized. * * * Though liberal
		education improves the young it cannot make them perfect. Though the attainment
		of knowledge may be rendered comparatively easy, it is chimerical to propose
		that it shall be universal, or totally without expense. Add to these the
		circumstance of raising and supporting the institution by a species of fraud
		which the interested would execrate and the popular would decry. * * *
		Prejudice in some and want of information in others were unhappily assisted by
		the indiscretion and misconduct of youth.” Notice that he attributes the
		odium which had been excited against the University partly to disappointment in
		regard to expense, to the clamor aroused by enforcing claims to confiscated
		lands and debts, and to reports widely circulated of the bad behavior of the
		students. He is however so hopeful that he proceeds in a strain of eloquent and
		courtly compliment to the fair donors. “The steadfast friends of the
		University have sustained the trial in its severities, its toils and alternate
		despondencies, till they can bless <pb xml:id="p133" n="133"/>the new dawnings of
		prosperity, which gild the horizon of their venerable years. For the animation
		they have felt in the conflict they are greatly indebted to that sex, which
		best knows how to estimate the virtues that impart civility to manners and
		refinement to life. The torch of patriotism which burned so inextinguishably in
		their breasts has been peculiarly brightened by the united flame of an
		<hi rend="italics">honest pride</hi>in you, which kindled at the reflection,
		that our native country boasts this seminary.” He closes with the last
		sentence of the letter of the ladies.</p>
          <p>Among the donations of a minor nature at this period it is recorded that
		ex-Governor Alexander Martin gave a pamphlet of his own composition entitled,
		“A New Science, interesting to the people of the United States,
		additional to the historical play of Columbus.” This presents the worthy
		patriot in a new role of dramatic author. The General Assembly of the State
		gave three volumes of a history of Geneva. The same Alexander Martin presented
		a microscope and <choice><sic>acromatic</sic><corr>achromatic</corr></choice>telescope 3 1-2 feet
		long, magnifying 70 times for land objects and 80 times for astronomical
		purposes; Judge Alfred Moore, a pair of globes; Hon. W. B. Grove, a barometer
		and thermometer; Professor Caldwell, a camera obscura. Other instruments were
		purchased. To the Museum were donated objects of much interest, such as by
		General Davie, three medals of Napoleon at Marengo; stained glass from Leon in
		old Spain; Indian ornaments of copper found near Halifax; Indian pipes of
		curious workmanship; by Charles W. Harris, inter alia, a Bezoar stone from the
		stomach of a deer; by Dr. Fisher, copper coins of Rome; by Henry Young, a
		jointed or glass snake and a “Bezoar stone from the stomach of a
		veal.” There were various other objects in the Museum, all lost in the
		casualties of four-score years and ten. The fact that the Bezoar stones
		voluntarily relinquished the ownership of charms against evil shows the decay
		of an ancient superstition.</p>
          <p>In 1809 it was determined to make still another effort to raise funds
		for the completion of the South (or Main) Building. President Caldwell,
		Treasurer Haywood and Wm. Gaston were the committee to draft an address to the
		friends of education in the State; and Caldwell was authorized to travel
		<pb xml:id="p134" n="134"/>through the State in vacation to secure subscriptions.
		The plan was his. In that year and again in 1811 he visited the more opulent
		parts of the State and secured about $8,220, and, while our people were
		going crazy over their naval victories in 1814, the rejoicing students moved
		into the completed South Building. The undertaker, or contractor, had the
		fitting name of John Close. There were 30 who gave $100 each. In the
		$100 list will be found such well-known names as those of Judge Lowry,
		Judge Henderson, Judge Hall, Archibald Henderson, William Boylan, Governor
		Williams, Chief Justice Taylor, Rev. Andrew Flinn, D.D., then of Charlotte.
		Judge Donnell gave $75, and Wm. Holt, of Wilmington, $40. There
		were 23 of $50 each, among them Joseph Gales, the editor; General
		Beverly Daniel, Governor Owen, John Gray Blount, General Thomas H. Blount.
		Among the four $40 subscribers was Dr. A. J. De Rosset, the elder. Among
		the six $30 subscribers we find Governor Dudley. Of the seven $25
		donors is Judge Potter. Of the 13 $20 men are Wm. Peace, who gave
		$10,000 to Peace Institute. There were 18 who gave smaller amounts,
		among them General Joseph G. Swift, of the United States army, who married Miss
		Walker in Wilmington, who was in the $10 list.</p>
          <p>It is noticeable that the baleful effects of party spirit, the
		luke-warmness, if not hostility to the University because the President and at
		least the majority of the Faculty were Federalists, are apparent on this list.
		The largest generosity was in the seaport towns, where hostility to Jefferson's
		Embargo was intense, while the farming section where Republicanism was supreme
		gave little. The $900 of Orange was by five men, one of whom was
		President of the University. The $300 of Halifax was by two donors, that
		county, after the departure of Governor Davie, being intensely Jeffersonian,
		and the $300 of Granville was also by two donors.</p>
          <p>It is pleasant to see how the young Raleigh merchants, Wm. Peace and
		Richard Smith, are found on the list; the former afterwards, as said, being the
		founder of Peace Institute, and the only daughter of the latter, by her bequest
		of $37,000 establishing the Professorship of General and Analytical
		Chemistry. In their company is seen the name of a learned divine, a
		<pb xml:id="p135" n="135"/>graduate of 1799, who after teaching and preaching in
		North Carolina, soon became pastor of a Presbyterian congregation in the city
		of Charleston in our neighboring State on the south, Andrew Flinn, D.D.</p>
          <p>Some of these benefactors have left memories of varied and important
		services to the State. There are Governors, United States Senators, Chief
		Justices and Judges, Attorney-Generals, leading divines, teachers, physicians,
		farmers, lawyers, merchants, in fine all the business pursuits of our
		people.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>CONFISCATED PROPERTY AND HOSTILE LEGISLATION.</head>
          <p>In December, 1794, the General Assembly was induced to make a grant to
		  the University which brought to it little money but much animosity. The
		  preamble recites that the Trustees have, with a laudable zeal for the promotion
		  of literature, erected a building for the use of the institution entrusted to
		  them and are prepared to commence the exercises, but have not funds to proceed
		  in the liberal manner, which the honor and interest of the public demand. The
		  act then gives the Trustees all unsold confiscated land, including the
		  forfeited rights of Henry Eustace McCulloch, a British subject, for lands
		  contracted to be sold by him, title being withheld for security of the purchase
		  money. The Trustees were authorized to make title on payment of the balances
		  due. The donation under the act was greatly weakened by the provision that all
		  above twenty thousand dollars should be paid over to the State, that only the
		  interest on receipts should be used, and that after ten years the principal
		  should be subject to the disposition of the General Assembly.</p>
          <p>The Trustees employed able lawyers to realize funds under the act. The
		  principal receipts were from the moneys due McCulloch, for lands contracted to
		  be sold to sundry inhabitants of Mecklenburg and adjoining counties, and from
		  the sale of confiscated lands, principally of McCulloch. Adlai Osborne, of
		  Rowan, a University attorney, reported sales from June, 1795, to July, 1798,
		  amounting to $14,946, most of which were on credit. There were 77
		  buyers. The net amount received up to November, 1807, was $7,160.58. In
		  1804 the Court of Conference decided in the cases of Ray's Executors v.
		  McCulloch, and Trustees v. Rice, that the claim of McCulloch was by the Treaty
		  of Peace of 1783 made good to him; whereupon the General Assembly ordered the
		  refunding of the foregoing amount, which had been invested in United States
		  stock, to the State Treasury in trust for such of his debtors as
		  <pb xml:id="p137" n="137"/>had paid the Trustees. The University, however, had the
		  receipt of the interest on the amount collected from time to time.
		  Notwithstanding this, as will be hereafter seen, the act of 1794 was a distinct
		  injury. It raised unfounded hopes and caused the University to be hated in a
		  very powerful section of the State. It well nigh caused its ruin. Davie alludes
		  to it in one of his letters, evidently with little hope.</p>
          <p>“If any man of proper literary merit could be found imprudent
		  enough to engage with us as President upon the prospect of our ten years fund,
		  I hope the Board may have more discretion than to employ him. I still hope
		  these funds may become permanent. As the proceeds of the confiscated lands will
		  now soon be collected it may perhaps be in our power to employ another
		  professor.” * * * Dr. McCorckle has pledged himself to demonstrate to the
		  Board at the next meeting that we are able to employ all the officers the plan
		  of education calls for, and pay them liberally, too. I am afraid it will remain
		  a problem notwithstanding the doctor's learning and talents.”</p>
          <p>We learn from a letter of Caldwell written in January, 1804, that it
		  was his opinion that the chief cause of the outbreak of the hostility against
		  the University in the General Assembly of 1800 was the litigation instituted by
		  the Trustees under the authority of the act of 1794. Having enjoyed these lands
		  for about twenty years since the confiscation law was passed, it was in
		  accordance with human nature for their possessors to be angry with a
		  corporation which was actively pressing in the courts suits on these old
		  claims. We find that George Fisher, of Rowan, a county adjoining that in which
		  most of them resided, made the motion, which was supported by all the members
		  from that and the adjacent counties with only four exceptions, to repeal the
		  act.</p>
          <p>A letter from a “Gentleman in Raleigh” to the editors of a
		  journal called <hi rend="italics">“The Anthology,”</hi>in relation
		  to the literature of North Carolina, states in regard to the University:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“The Rev. Joseph Caldwell, President of the University, is the
		  first scientific and literary character in the State. He is now employed in
		  writing a book on Mathematics intended as a school book. Two sermons and an
		  eulogium on General Washington <pb xml:id="p138" n="138"/>by him, which have been
		  published separately in pamphlets, are handsome specimens of his
		  abilities.”</p>
            <p>“To a ‘huge misshapen pile,’ which is placed on a
		  high rocky eminence twenty-eight miles from this (Raleigh), has been given the
		  name of a college, and a donation from General Thomas Person, built a neat
		  Chapel. After considerable difficulties were experienced on account of
		  incompetent teachers and insurrections among the students, the institution
		  under the direction of Mr. Caldwell, two professors and two tutors, acquired
		  regularity and consistency in its exercises. When our enlightened Legislature
		  discovered that education was inconsistent with Republicanism, that it created
		  an aristocracy of the learned who would trample upon the rights and liberties
		  of the ignorant, and that an equality of intellect was necessary to preserve an
		  equality of rights, influenced by these wise and patriotic considerations the
		  Legislature gave to themselves again what they had before given to the
		  University. The institution now languishes. Mr. Caldwell's anti-Republican love
		  of literature, and not the emoluments of his office, induces him to preserve in
		  existence and by his influence, even the shadow of a college. He is assisted by
		  only one tutor; the funds do not permit the employment of more.”</p>
          </q>
          <p>Such was the popular odium at this time against the University that
		  the General Assembly of 1800 not only repealed the act of 1794, but,
		  notwithstanding the strenuous exertions of some of the ablest men of the day,
		  went further and repealed that of 1789, granting escheated property. So far as
		  the hostile legislation affected confiscated property, it was not of much
		  consequence, because the grant was to expire in 1804 and the courts would have
		  forced the University to disgorge the receipts from the mortgages and liens of
		  McCulloch. But the deprivation of escheats, if successfully carried out, would
		  have been fatal. It would have taken away the unclaimed land warrants located
		  in Tennessee, the proceeds of which were the interest bearing endowment prior
		  to the Civil War.</p>
          <p>But it was not carried into effect. In the first place the Court of
		  Conference in the case of University v. Foy, 1 Murphy, 58, decided the
		  repealing act unconstitutional; and although <pb xml:id="p139" n="139"/>this case
		  was overruled by that of University v. Maultsby, 8 Ired. Eq., 257, the action
		  of the court, and we hope a change of sentiment, led the General Assembly in
		  1805 to restore the escheats. One of the strongest advocates of such
		  restoration was Maurice Moore, heretofore described as one of the early
		  students. I have examined the votes on this drastic measure and find them
		  chiefly, but not entirely, on party lines. The names of those who stood by the
		  institution on this vital question should be recorded.</p>
          <p>The Senators were Henry S. Bonner, of Beaufort; John Johnston, of
		  Bertie; I. Lewis, of Bladen; Benjamin Smith, of Brunswick; Caleb Phifer, of
		  Cabarrus; William Gaston, of Craven; Bythell Bell, of Edgecombe; Jordan Hill,
		  of Franklin; Thomas Taylor, of Granville; Robert White, of Green; Stephen W.
		  Conner, of Halifax; Thomas Wynns, of Hertford; Joseph Masters, of Hyde; Durant
		  Hatch, of Jones; Wm. McKenzie, of Martin; John H. Drake, of Nash; John Hill, of
		  New Hanover; John M. Beauford, of Northampton; David Ray, of Orange; Frederick
		  Bryan, of Pitt; Elias Barnes, of Robeson; James Collier, of Warren; Richard
		  Croom, of Greene.</p>
          <p>John Johnston was a nephew of Governor Samuel Johnston. Wm. Gaston at
		  the age of twenty-two was beginning his long career of enlightened public
		  service, always advocating liberal and progressive ideas. He made a motion
		  which would have secured to the University all lands actually taken into the
		  possession of the Trustees, but it was voted down. Senator Benjamin Smith is
		  the same who, at the first meeting of the Board in 1790, donated Tennessee land
		  warrants to the new institution. He induced the Senate by his powerful
		  influence to agree to refer the whole matter to a joint committee, but the
		  House refused to agree to it.</p>
          <p>The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 32 to 23, having already
		  passed the House by the decisive majority of 82 to 35. Among the minority
		  Senators I notice only one who attained any eminence: Peter Forney, of Lincoln,
		  who was afterwards a member of Congress. Of the majority, Senators Smith became
		  Governor, Gaston a member of Congress and Judge of the Supreme Court of our
		  State, Wynns, after whom Winton is named, a member of Congress.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p140" n="140"/>
          <p>The members of the House who stood up against the adversaries of the
		  University were John Kennedy and Frederick Grist, of Beaufort; Joseph Jordan,
		  of Bertie; Street Ashford and J. Bradley, of Bladen; Benjamin Mills, of New
		  Brunswick; George Ellis, James Gatling and John S. Nelson, of Craven; Thomas C.
		  Ferebee, of Currituck; Sterling Yancey, of Granville; Stephen Harwell, of
		  Halifax; Robert Montgomery and James Jones, of Hertford; Joseph Jordan and Adam
		  Gaskins, of Hyde; John Moore, of Lincoln; Jeremiah Slade, of Martin; Charles
		  Polk, of Mecklenburg; Samuel Ashe, Joshua G. Wright and Alexander D. Moore, of
		  New Hanover; Samuel Benton; John Cabe and Absalom Tatom, of Orange; John Nixon
		  and Charles W. Blount, of Perquimans; Herndon Harolson, of Person; Richard
		  Evans, of Pitt; Evan Alexander, of Rowan; Henry Seawell, of Wake; James Turner
		  and Thomas E. Sumner, of Warren; and Meshack Franklin, of Surry.</p>
          <p>Of the above John Moore, Alexander Duncan Moore, Evan Alexander and
		  John Hill, brother of William H. Hill, who assisted in selecting the site of
		  the University, were members of the Board of Trustees. Charles Polk was, I
		  think, the brother of Col. Wm. Polk, who, on account of his love of fun, went
		  by the name of “Devil Charley.” Joshua G. Wright was afterwards a
		  Judge. Samuel Ashe was a worthy son of Governor Samuel Ashe. Samuel Benton was
		  a brother of Jesse, father of Thomas Hart Benton.</p>
          <p>Absalom Tatum had been a member of Congress, as were also Evan
		  Alexander and Meshack Franklin. James Turner was in two years to be Governor,
		  and then Senator of the United States. Thomas E. Sumner was a son of General
		  Jethro Sumner of the Continental line, and soon afterwards emigrated to
		  Tennessee.</p>
          <p>It seems evident that those who voted to sustain the University were
		  not punished by the people for their action. It is equally clear that its
		  opponents did not lose the favor of the people. More exciting questions
		  occupied their minds.</p>
          <p>In a letter written June 9, 1805, on the eve of his departure to his
		  plantation in South Carolina, Davie deplored the distressing state of the
		  University on account of legislative hostility. <pb xml:id="p141" n="141"/>Great
		  injury had been inflicted by this hostility on the reputation of the State. He
		  says, “men of science in other States regard the people of North Carolina
		  as a sort of semi-barbarians, among whom neither learning, virtue nor men of
		  science possess any estimation. * * * In South Carolina a professorship is more
		  eagerly canvassed than the secretaryship of the government of the United
		  States, the consequence of the liberal spirit displayed by their Assembly.
		  After a handsome and permanent endowment of the offices of the institution
		  (South Carolina College) they voted $10,000 for purchase of a library
		  and philosophical apparatus. What a contrast. Poor North Carolina!”</p>
          <p>It is interesting to inquire whether there were other causes of the
		  unpopularity of the University besides the litigation under the act of
		  1794.</p>
          <p>Naturally the reports of the misbehavior of students, undoubtedly bad,
		  but grievously exaggerated, had a tendency to weaken the influence of the
		  University, all the more because none of the Faculty were known to our people.
		  But papers in our archives show conclusively that political feeling was the
		  chief cause.</p>
          <p>A letter from John Henry Hobart, heretofore described, to Mr. Caldwell
		  in March, 1798, indicates the views of the two friends about public matters.
		  After a little badinage on the subject of love and regret that Caldwell's
		  health had not improved, he said, “What think you of the honorable
		  Congress? Do you not think that they are in a fair way to rival the French
		  Convention? We have sometimes heard of members there tusseling for the tribune
		  (i. e., to ‘get the floor’). But Mr. Lyon has improved upon them
		  and attempted to make spitting in the face fashionable. Is it not astonishing
		  that party spirit should have shielded this infamous wretch from punishment?
		  Dr. Griswold has tried the thickness of his coarse hide, and I only wish he had
		  beaten him to a jelly.”</p>
          <p>“No direct news from our Commissioners. It appears that the
		  French Directory treat them with silent contempt. When will the American spirit
		  be roused? Is it content tamely to lick the dust? Can you not infuse some
		  Federalism into your <pb xml:id="p142" n="142"/>neighbors in Carolina, and displace
		  some of your present ignorant and pusillanimous members?”</p>
          <p>The North Carolina Senators were then Alexander Martin and Timothy
		  Bloodworth; and the Representatives, Thomas Blount, Nathan Bryan, Dempsey
		  Burgess, Wm. Barry Grove, Matthew Locke, Nathaniel Macon, Joseph McDowell (of
		  Quaker Meadows), Richard Stanford and Robert Williams, all men of good
		  character and not one deserving the harsh language of Bishop Hobart.</p>
          <p>There is some evidence that Caldwell was indiscreet in regard to the
		  utterance of his political sentiments. We have proof positive that there was a
		  widespread opinion that he was a bitter partisan.</p>
          <p>On the 22d of February he delivered an address on the character of
		  General Washington, who died about two months previously. The Senior and Junior
		  classes requested a copy for publication. They say “The theme, noble as
		  it is, has received additional splendor from the spirit of candor in which it
		  was discussed. The publication will refute the calumnies which have been so
		  industriously circulated.”</p>
          <p>Two or three years after this a man, styling himself
		  “Citizen,” attacked the University fiercely in the public prints.
		  One of his charges was that “every effort is made to give direction to
		  the minds of the students on political subjects, favorable to a high-toned
		  aristocratic government.” * * * “The country will be imbued with
		  aristocratic principles because an aristocrat is at the head of it.”</p>
          <p>In giving this a bitter denial, Caldwell says: “It has been made
		  the subject of declamation on public election grounds a long time.” * * *
		  “I have common sense to refrain from subjects upon which, if I were to
		  enter into discussion with my pupils, I should only incur their contempt.
		  Politics is a subject upon which youth will speak and determine with as much
		  confidence as men of any age, experience or study.” He appeals to the
		  Republican members of the Board to say whether he sought the office of
		  executive head.</p>
          <p>It was already recognized that Governor Davie was the virtual head of
		  the University. “Citizen” makes an ill-natured fling at him.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p143" n="143"/>
          <p>Another cause of unpopularity was the fact that the management of the
		  University was in the hands of a self-perpetuating body. The Board of Trustees
		  filling the vacancies in its body, having been Federalist in the beginning,
		  naturally continued so, although the people were generally Republican.</p>
          <p>It seems strange that it should have been seriously attempted to bring
		  odium on the authorities of the University because of the beginning of the
		  South Building. The correspondent “Citizen” denounces it as
		  “the palace-like erection, which is much too large for usefulness, and
		  might be aptly termed the ‘Temple of Folly,’ planned by the
		  Demi-God Davie.” Caldwell answers this sarcasm by showing that it was
		  absolutely essential to the progress of the institution. “No Northern
		  college has more than two persons in each room and the rooms are larger than
		  ours.” In each room at Princeton are three windows instead of two. Into
		  our smaller rooms originally three beds and furniture for six persons were
		  forced, leaving hardly space for the six inhabitants to turn without jostling
		  one another. This was endured for some years. The Board determined to put an
		  end to this. The Main Building was commenced and an order passed that only four
		  should occupy one room. This was bad enough. “Here are fifty-six persons
		  huddled together with their trunks, beds, tables, chairs, books and clothes
		  into fourteen little rooms, which by the excessive heat of summer are enough to
		  stifle them, and in the winter scarcely admit them to sit around the fireplace.
		  When the weather permits they fly to the shade of the trees, where they find a
		  retreat from the burr and hurry and irrepressible conversation of a crowded
		  society.” They even erected huts in the forest for greater privacy, but
		  this was found to interfere with discipline, and was prohibited by law.</p>
          <p>The building was planned not by the “Demi-God Davie,” but
		  by Governor Spaight. It was to have twenty-three habitable rooms. “These
		  with the rooms in the East Building will amount to 38, holding 76 students. We
		  have more than once had over 70. The excess above 56, i. e., four to a room,
		  lived in the village.” Caldwell winds up his statements with a spurt of
		  eloquence. “If rooms sufficient were here we would have
		  <pb xml:id="p144" n="144"/>100 students and our nation would have, not a Temple of
		  Folly, but a monument of glory to herself and a pledge of utility and worth to
		  all succeeding generations.” He closes his discussion of this charge of
		  Citizen with a trenchant sarcasm. “As soon as the light of truth is
		  thrown upon Citizen, the visage from which issued such noisy and imposing
		  declamation appears nothing more than one wretched blank of inanity and
		  dullness. Malignity and lust of sway are his guiding principles and his
		  composition unites with the boisterousness of a stentor, the hardihood of
		  callous feelings.”</p>
          <p>To the charge of “Citizen” that the University employed as
		  teachers men from other States, as far as Massachusetts, and even from Europe,
		  Caldwell admitted the truth and contended that the only way to escape from this
		  degrading dependence is to facilitate education among ourselves, “the
		  true method of preventing an aristocracy of learning.”</p>
          <p>He complained bitterly of the unjust charges made against the
		  University. He indignantly affirmed that its enemies had caught up flying
		  rumors, not founded in fact, and then proceeded to multiply and misrepresent
		  and aggravate until the country was at length led to believe that the
		  institution could not be worse if it were filled with a parcel of inveterate
		  demons from among the damned.”</p>
          <p>I think I have shown that there were bitter partisan feelings against
		  the University, which naturally excited strong language on the part of the
		  pugnacious young Scotch-Irishman at its head. Archibald Murphey, however, the
		  young lawyer, ex-professor, writing from Martinsville, (old Guilford
		  Courthouse), seemed to attribute less importance to hostile attacks.</p>
          <p>“Be up and active, for the University suffers as much from the
		  supineness of its friends, as from the malignity of its enemies.”</p>
          <p>The friends of the University generally trembled for its fate during
		  that alarming period. Judge Sitgreaves, writing to Treasurer Haywood, says,
		  “It would be a most painful idea to suppose that after so much pains had
		  been used by yourself and others to get it on its legs it should by any
		  accident be overturned. The aspect of the last legislature appeared to be
		  rather <pb xml:id="p145" n="145"/>malignant.” He sees no remedy except the
		  election of a President, “whose weight of character will influence the
		  Faculty as well as the students.”</p>
          <p>David Stone, soon to be Senator and Governor, in a letter in 1800 to
		  the same Treasurer Haywood from Washington, where he was in attendance on
		  Congress as a Representative, did not agree with Sitgreaves, and mentioned a
		  different difficulty encountered by the distressed University. “There is
		  danger of being entirely without teachers,” but he hopes that the
		  professors will stay. He argued against having a President because the salary
		  would not command a first-class man. “The operations of the present
		  government, or some other cause, has made money so much to abound this way, and
		  further East, and raised the price of living to such an extravagant height,
		  that salaries, considered handsome with us (in North Carolina) are here
		  scarcely thought worth notice.”</p>
          <p>On April 15, 1800, Hugh Williamson wrote from New York, then his
		  residence, that he hoped to get for a professor a clergyman, educated at the
		  New Haven College (Yale), because “his congregation originally small is
		  greatly diminished by the operation of politics. Many of his former hearers are
		  so completely modernized and philosophised as to think with the French National
		  Convention that “Death is an eternal sleep.” He is more solicitious
		  to get one who has the spirit of command than one merely a good scholar. He

          <head>CALDWELL AS A CONTROVERSIALIST.</head>
          <p>The worthy President was in those days a fighting member of the Church
		  militant. We have a long and extremely spirited reply of his to an attack on
		  the University for which he held Basil Gaither, Senator from Rowan, Absalom
		  Tatum, Commoner from the borough of Hillsboro, who had once been a friend of
		  the institution, James Welbourn, Senator from Wilkes and William Slade,
		  Commoner from Edenton, responsible. An analysis of this open letter gives a
		  good idea of arguments used by the opponents of higher education a century ago,
		  and of Caldwell's style and manner of answering them.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p146" n="146"/>
          <p>He begins by accusing them of being most conspicuous in trying to ruin
		  the University—</p>
          <p>1. The charge that it has been a costly institution is not true. The
		  State only gave property lying dormant and useless to the public. This is
		  correct with the exception of $10,000 loaned and converted into a
		  gift.</p>
          <p>2. The cry that the poor are being taxed for the benefit of the rich
		  is but a trick of hypocrisy, the crooked policy of imposture.</p>
          <p>3. The attack is founded on an unreasonable envy, which some men feel
		  at the superior advantages of others.</p>
          <p>4. It is objected that University education will bring monarchical
		  principles upon us. It is impossible. The State is too extensive, the land too
		  much divided. Education at the University only costs $100 per year. It
		  cannot be engrossed by the rich. Those making these objections are really
		  afraid that improved minds may oust them from their “seats of elevation,
		  leaving them at home to drink their whiskey until they are besotted, or to
		  drive their negroes in the cornfield.”</p>
          <p>Our youth educated abroad will have little State pride. The effectual
		  method of building up an aristocracy is to deny education to all except those
		  who are rich enough to send their sons abroad,” at a cost of $400
		  or $500. “It is a fact which all witness that those, not North
		  Carolinians, who come in among us are able to supplant our own citizens in the
		  transaction of our own business. If education should become easy and plenty
		  among us, we shall preserve our public liberties from the grasp of those who
		  would otherwise engross all merit and abilities and knowledge to
		  themselves.”</p>
          <p>5. Forcing our citizens to send their sons to Northern Colleges sends
		  out streams of wealth, and increases the advantages they already have over us.
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Per contra</foreign></hi>by creating a
		  University of character we cause currents of wealth to flow into us. We are
		  already obliged to send our wealth and commerce into Virginia, South Carolina
		  and Pennsylvania. It is sought to force us to give them other fruits of our
		  labors, whereas we may easily make reprisals on them.</p>
          <p>As a specimen of Caldwell's power of vituperation, I give his
		  peroration to this branch of the subject: “Be assured, gentlemen,
		  <pb xml:id="p147" n="147"/>the stupidity of your politics shall be known. . . . The
		  grave may open to you a retreat from public anger and contempt, and you shall
		  still live notorious monuments of that vileness, into which a sinister, a
		  malignant and insidious warfare against the good of the country must very
		  shortly descend,” and more of the same sort.</p>
          <p>He contended that “every national institution serves to generate
		  among us a national spirit and character. . . . It gives a spring to the public
		  nerve, and, by keeping it active, gives it tone and power.” “It is
		  the very nature of a place of public education to polish and give play to the
		  springs of human action, to spread abroad a desire of information, a spirit of
		  active enterprise, and the instruments of interest, which must, without it, be
		  buried in some distant part of the world.”</p>
          <p>7. Another argument for the University is that it trains at a critical
		  period of their lives youths of fortune, who would otherwise waste their time
		  and learn dissipation. They should be considered the property of the country
		  and such training provided for them as will ensure improvement to their genius,
		  regularity to their conduct, and a love of religion to their affections.</p>
          <p>8. It may be said, let the rich erect their own institutions. The
		  objections are—</p>
          <p>1. It is too expensive to have separate institutions for different
		  classes of society.</p>
          <p>2. Education is the business of the public and should not be
		  delegated.</p>
          <p>3. Men of means should not be allowed exclusively to support the
		  University—</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">a.</hi>Because the students would not have a sense
		  of obligation to the State, but to the men of wealth whose bounty they
		  received.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">b.</hi>A generous people should desire the chief
		  share in effecting what is most honorable and advantageous to themselves. But
		  Caldwell here breaks off into invective, “It is such men as you who rob a
		  people, when you once get the sway into your hands, of the honor and the
		  pleasure of every liberal act they could do.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p148" n="148"/>
          <p>Other arguments in favor of the University are urged. North Carolina
		  must come into competition with others. Will it do to send to the national
		  government men who know nothing of the world, of civil government, of the power
		  of speaking with some degree of oratory; who have never strengthened and
		  quickened the powers of their minds by long study and the exercise of reason?
		  Then the irate Scotch-Irish preacher bursts into a fierce <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">argumentum ad homines</foreign>.</hi></p>
          <p>“It is by no means impossible that chosen as our congressmen are
		  by districts, you might make the people near to you think that you were fit to
		  make laws for a generation. But what would be the result? The capital of the
		  United States would be to you like another world. The hall of Congress fitted
		  with members not only of as strong natural genius but of as perfect education
		  as any men in the country, would be a place where you would shrink from the eye
		  of every spectator. . . . You would be glad to take shelter under a dumb and
		  listening silence. And when you heard the tongue of eloquence rolling upon your
		  ear the imposing accents of reasoning and harmony, all that would be left for
		  you would be to be shaped at the will of skilful politicians.”</p>
          <p>“If you look at the representatives of this State for some years
		  this will be proved past controversy. . . . It is true, in a large
		  representation, we may see that there will be some who are senseless enough.
		  But unfortunately for us, so large a proportion of ours has always been of a
		  cast so completely inferior, being hardly able to show two or three of
		  respectable talents, from among a dozen, that there is no wonder that our
		  State, though so large and populous, is regarded in the very lowest rank in the
		  Union. . . . In what light ought we to view such men as you, who are striving
		  with all your might and main to condemn us to endless continuance in the same
		  unhappy lot?”</p>
          <p>Caldwell then defends the University against the charge of
		  immorality.</p>
          <p>9. “It is customary with you to raise a clamor about the
		  irreligion and vice which you ignorantly affirm to prevail among the youth who
		  are educated at a University. You are industrious <pb xml:id="p149" n="149"/>to
		  search out every boyish trick which you can come to the knowledge of, and you
		  do not fail to paint every act in the deepest colors of criminality and
		  corruption. . . . It is less unjust to you to condemn a whole society of people
		  for the indiscretion or absurd behavior of a few, than it is for these few to
		  be guilty of some absurdities. . . . How dreadful, how unjust, how hard it is
		  that calumny must be forever watching, as with a lynx's eye, the disorders of a
		  few wrong-headed young people, who are mixed up in a college with the body of
		  the students.”</p>
          <p>That the ferocity of party spirit was baleful to the University is
		  further shown by a letter written by the eminent “Log-college”
		  teacher and fighting parson, Captain of Cavalry in the Revolution, Rev. Dr.
		  James Hall, acknowledging the degree of D.D. conferred on him in 1810. He was
		  nettled that sometime before his name had been proposed as a Trustee without
		  success. He begs that he be not again nominated, partly because he was in his
		  69th year and partly because an editor—a “fugitive European”
		  [Joseph Gales] had characterized all clerical Federalists as “Rebel
		  Priests.” His uniform character as a patriot and the part he acted
		  through the whole Revolution have not saved him from this and other most odious
		  epithets. One of his co-presbyters had been elected a member, (Rev. Dr. James
		  Wallis), the only Democrat in the Two Presbyteries, consisting of at least
		  thirty members. He urges that party spirit had prevailed too much in the choice
		  of Trustees, and in counselling that more of the clergy should be made members
		  of the Board, he asserts, that it is well known that no set of men under heaven
		  have done so much, or are capable of doing so much for the promotion of
		  literature, as those of the clerical order. He then gives unstinted praise to
		  President Caldwell. “I query if Christendom can produce such an example
		  on that subject as has been, and now may be found in the University of North
		  Carolina.” He then announces that he intends to donate a considerable
		  number of volumes to the University, which was afterwards done, a most pleasing
		  proof that this most worthy man, who in his day exerted wide influence for
		  good, retained no malice for the injury which in his opinion the Federalist
		  Trustees had done him.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p150" n="150"/>
          <p>When the escheats were restored in 1805, the same act made the
		  Governor for the time being the <hi rend="italics">ex-officio</hi>President of
		  the Board of Trustees. Further popularity was gained by giving the General
		  Assembly on joint ballot the power of filling vacancies, and, to ensure
		  regularity of attendance, two years continued absence from meetings forfeited
		  the seat of the delinquent.</p>
          <p>In 1807 the Board was rendered more efficient by making seven members
		  a quorum for transacting business. In 1809 balances in the hands of executors
		  and administrators, remaining for seven years unclaimed, were vested in the
		  University. And so were likewise balances due the State by Sheriffs and other
		  officers prior to December 31st, 1799, but of course claims of such venerable
		  antiquity were not copious fountains of wealth. It shows badly either for the
		  financial integrity of the officers of the old times, or for the accuracy of
		  their business methods, that there were no less than sixty-eight judgments and
		  other evidences of debt against the same number of defaulters turned over to
		  the University. Among these there were seven clerks, sixteen sheriffs, nineteen
		  sellers of confiscated property, nine entry-takers, eight agents for sale of
		  lottery tickets in which the State, in behalf of the city of Raleigh, was
		  interested, one “Commissionary,” i. e. Commissary, and two judges.
		  The dues of the judges, Samuel Spencer and John Haywood, were for licenses of
		  lawyers. The total amount due amounted to the handsome sum—on
		  paper—of $111,010 certificates and $38,942 in money.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>COLLECTION OF ESCHEATS.</head>
          <p>For the purpose of more thoroughly realizing the escheats, which had
		  been re-granted to the institution, the State was divided in 1809 into ten
		  districts and an attorney over each appointed. Naturally the friends of
		  education were chosen and hence their names should be recorded. For the 1st
		  District beginning with Ashe, Israel Pickens of Burke and Robert H. Burton of
		  Lincoln; for the 2nd beginning with Rowan, Lewis Beard of Salisbury; for the
		  3rd beginning with Anson, John Cameron of Fayetteville and Alexander McMillan
		  of Richmond County; for the 4th beginning with New Hanover, Samuel R.
		  <pb xml:id="p151" n="151"/>Jocelyn of Wilmington; for the 5th beginning with
		  Chatham, A. D. Murphey of Hillsboro; for the 6th beginning with Halifax, John
		  Whitaker of Halifax; for the 7th beginning with Carteret, Wright C. Stanly and
		  John T. West, both of Newbern; for the 8th beginning with Hyde, John Roulhac of
		  Martin County and Thomas B. Haughton of Washington County; for the 9th
		  beginning with Bertie, Samuel Turner of Bertie; for the 10th beginning with
		  Wake, Robert H. Jones of Warren.</p>
          <p>Any two Trustees, with the Attorney, were authorized to compromise all
		  litigation. They might select three freeholders to fix the price of land, which
		  might be sold on a credit of one, two and three years, with a discount of six
		  per cent allowed for cash. The Attorneys were allowed three per cent
		  commissions for selling, and two and a half per cent for collecting and paying
		  over the money. In case of suit fees usual among lawyers could be charged.
		  Annual reports must be made. Amounts over $1,000 were to be remitted in
		  one month. Less amounts within three months. As might be expected the
		  commissions were increased in special cases. In settling with Samuel R. Jocelyn
		  he was, on account of great and signal services, allowed ten per cent on sales,
		  and was not charged with failure to collect $3,218. This was very
		  handsome, as his sales amounted to $21,800.</p>
          <p>At the same session of the Board Samuel Polk of Tennessee was
		  authorized to sell all the Gerrard lands except his “service
		  right,” 2,560 acres. Under this authority Col. Wm. Polk became the
		  purchaser at the price of $4,352, for all which could be identified.</p>
          <p>The receipts mainly from this source and from escheats were so liberal
		  about this time that the Trustees were not only able to pay for the South
		  Building, but to buy $11,050 stock in the Bank of Newbern, $8,400
		  in the Bank of Cape Fear, and $2,000 in the State Bank of N. C. Twenty
		  shares of the Newbern Bank were bought of Judge Gaston at 15 per cent premium
		  and 27 shares of Cape Fear at 25 per cent premium of Judge Murphey. Dividends
		  of 8 and 10 per cent per annum were received from the State Bank in addition to
		  a bonus of 17 1-2 per cent.</p>
          <p>As in duty bound the Trustees were active and watchful in
		  <pb xml:id="p152" n="152"/>claiming the rights devolved by the law upon them, yet
		  whenever a case appealing to their generous feelings came up they were
		  sufficiently liberal. I give one example: John R. Donnell, afterwards a
		  Superior Court Judge, who graduated at the University with highest honors in
		  1807, was the heir of an uncle who owned a plantation in Lenoir County. As
		  young Donnell was born in Ireland, he could not, as the law then stood, inherit
		  the land. The Trustees in 1810 relinquished their claim, taking the precaution,
		  however, to have the General Assembly approve their action.</p>
          <p>I find an application for relief by Jonathan Price. In a letter dated
		  July 21st, 1817, he stated that the State, in 1792 and 1794, loaned him and
		  Christmas, (William Christmas, doubtless, the Surveyor who laid out the city of
		  Raleigh, Senator from Franklin), money to complete a map of the State from
		  actual survey. This debt was transferred to the University. Christmas deserted
		  him and Strother took his place. In this work he had spent the prime of his
		  life and his little patrimony. The work commanded the admiration not only of
		  our sister States, but of European Reviewers. One of the English Reviews
		  pronounced the map worthy to be classed among the first published of its kind
		  in the world. Some of the States have made provision for the publication of the
		  maps of their territories “on the plan of that of Price and
		  Strother,” and have voted ample means for the purpose. He pathetically
		  adds, “May the persons employed reap the reward of their labors, and not,
		  like me, in the winter of their age, be left in the pinching hands of poverty,
		  nor doomed to the melancholy reflection, that on one hand a grave is yawning to
		  receive them and on the other a prison. But I should feel proud, even in a
		  dungeon, of the advantages which the present generation are receiving, and
		  which posterity will receive, from the time and fortune I have devoted to my
		  country; and though my feelings make my old hand tremble while I write, my
		  heart beats with honest exultation in the recollection that my labors will
		  survive me.” He applied to the legislature for relief. If that should be
		  refused, he offered, if the University withdraw the process issued against him,
		  to give one-half of all sums due him for maps <pb xml:id="p153" n="153"/>sold, and
		  half of future sales during his life, reserving the other half as a small
		  pittance for his maintenance; after his death the copyright and all unsold to
		  go to the University. It must be remembered that at this time a debtor could be
		  imprisoned by the creditor twenty days before taking the proper oath and being
		  released.</p>
          <p>Three members of the Executive Committee, Messrs. Porter, Haywood and
		  Polk, authorized the recall of the ca-sa which had been issued and reference of
		  the matter to the Board of Trustees. At their next meeting further action for
		  the collection of the debt, £698, 18s. was indefinitely suspended on
		  payment of costs, the reason given being the poverty of the defendant. The
		  offer of Mr. Price with regard to sales and copyright was generously not
		  accepted.</p>
          <p>The map referred to was the only large, or wall, map until that of
		  McRae was published in 1831.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS.—TROUBLOUS TIMES.</head>
          <p>The first Commencement during which diplomas were granted was on July
		  4, 1798. Seven young men headed the honorable procession of graduates of the
		  University of North Carolina.</p>
          <p>It is proper to name all of these graduate fathers. Samuel Hinton of
		  Wake, a farmer; William Houston, a physician of Iredell; Hinton James, the
		  first student; Robert Locke, farmer of Rowan; Alexander Osborne, physician of
		  Rowan; Edwin Jay Osborne, lawyer of Salisbury and New York; Adam A. Springs,
		  planter of Mecklenburg, all prominent and useful citizens. Houston, Locke and
		  Springs were distinguished.</p>
          <p>The Committee of Visitation after expressing their high sense of the
		  talents of the gentlemen engaged in the competition in declamation, awarded the
		  first honor to Mr. Nathaniel W. Williams of Tennessee, the second to Mr.
		  Richard Eagles of Brunswick, and the third to Mr. John B. Baker of Gates. It
		  appearing that there was a tendency to adopt dramatic acting, General Davie
		  strongly advised against it.</p>
          <p>He wrote, “Dramas are by no means so well calculated for
		  improvement in elocution as single speeches. If the Faculty
		  <pb xml:id="p154" n="154"/>insist on this kind of exhibition the Board must
		  interfere. Our object is to make the students men, not players.” It
		  appears that very harsh criticism of the teaching and morals of the institution
		  had been <choice><sic>idulged</sic><corr>indulged</corr></choice>in in some quarters. Davie remarks
		  concerning this: “Human malevolence in some, interested views in others,
		  the ignorance and caprice of parents, will continue to injure our institution,
		  until it has acquired some stability, some fixed character, and this process
		  will require some years.”</p>
          <p>The creation of the spirit of dramatic acting was due to the influence
		  of a very interesting person, William Augustus Richards, the Tutor in the
		  Preparatory Department, of whom we have an excellent sketch by Judge Murphey.
		  He was a native of London, and had a fair education. For some reason he left
		  home and enlisted as a common sailor, serving both on merchantmen and men of
		  war. Having aspirations for a higher life, he deserted his ship at either
		  Baltimore or Norfolk and was saved from the searching party by the kindness of
		  an old lady, who had pity on his forlorn condition. By accident he met the
		  manager of a strolling band of players and joined the company, gaining of
		  course only a small pittance for his services. In the course of their
		  journeyings they reached Warrenton in North Carolina, the seat of an excellent
		  Academy, under the management of Mr. Marcus George, the teacher of many of our
		  best men, among them Chief Justice Ruffin and Weldon N. Edwards, a member of
		  Congress and President of the Convention of 1861. Two of the Trustees of the
		  Academy, Dr. Gloster and Mr. Wm. Falkener, discerned in Richards qualities
		  superior to his station and procured his appointment as assistant to Mr.
		  George. Thence he was induced to come to the University as Tutor, and till his
		  death in December, 1798, discharged his duties, in the language of the Board of
		  Trustees, “with singular reputation to himself and advantage to the
		  institution.” Judge Murphey says, “His acquaintance with the stage
		  in some degree vitiated his morals and gave an air of affectation to his
		  manners. But these defects he greatly corrected before his death, and
		  counterbalanced by his many good qualities of mind and heart.” He
		  naturally was interested in instructing the young men in elocution, and his
		  proposal to <pb xml:id="p155" n="155"/>deliver lectures on oratory was accepted by
		  the Trustees, but its execution was prevented by his death. It was he who
		  induced the Literary Societies to join in substituting for a time a dramatic
		  performance for all other duties. It is allowable to conjecture that the
		  scenery in Williamsboro, a few miles from Warrenton, which they purchased for
		  the occasion, was the <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">tristes
		  reliquiae</foreign></hi>of the strolling company, which he left for more
		  serious and useful work.</p>
          <p>The term preceding the Commencement of 1799 was especially stormy. For
		  some reason Mr. Gillaspie became personally obnoxious and the students broke
		  out in rebellion against the laws and the Faculty. They actually, according to
		  the testimony of Mr. Caldwell. “beat Mr. Gillaspie personally, waylaid
		  and stoned Mr. Webb, accosted Mr. Flinn with the intention of beating him, but
		  were diverted from it, and at length uttered violent threats against Mr.
		  Murphey and Mr. Caldwell, which were never put into execution.” The
		  disorders were going on for a week. The students proposed to Mr. Caldwell that
		  he should assume the supreme authority, which request was, in his own language,
		  “rejected with contempt. It was necessary to summon the Trustees for the
		  appointment of a superintendent and restoring submission to the laws.”
		  Three of the worst offenders were dismissed from the institution.</p>
          <p>The effect of these disorders, of course, was to diminish the number
		  of the students. While there were eight graduates in 1799, there were only
		  three in 1800. The Faculty all tendered their resignations, so that there was
		  danger of the University failing for want of teachers. In November, 1799, a
		  committee of the Trustees, by order of the Board, advertised for a Professor of
		  Natural, Moral and Political Philosophy, of the Languages and Belles Lettres,
		  and of Mathematics. They stated that the salary and emoluments of each
		  professorship had been upwards of 500 dollars per annum, exclusive of board at
		  Commons. A Tutor in the Preparatory Department was also wanted at a salary of
		  200 dollars and board. The result of this glittering offer was the re-election
		  of Caldwell to the Chair of Mathematics, also to succeed Gillaspie as Presiding
		  Professor, and of Wm. Edwards Webb to be Professor of Languages in the place of
		  Holmes.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p156" n="156"/>
          <p>The early records of the University are so meagre and in such
		  confusion that we cannot ascertain definitely the causes of this most
		  disreputable riot of 1799. Certain facts which have come down to us throw a
		  light upon it.</p>
          <p>We find an indictment of Prof. Samuel Allen Holmes by the other
		  professors, in the handwriting of Caldwell, charging him with offences so
		  serious as to show, if they were well grounded, that he was an 18th century
		  anarchist in theory, and a traitor to the University in practice.</p>
          <p>The charges in substance were that when he entered the service of the
		  University he was a Baptist preacher, but he at once became an apostate. He
		  advocated the doctrine that there is no such thing as virtue—that the
		  love of virtue is a mere superstition; that to shake off its obligations and to
		  bend to the circumstances and character of the times so as to advance one's
		  interest or ambition is the best morality. For any man to profess to be
		  governed by the fixed principles of justice, of honor, of truth, or of
		  generosity, is sufficient to stamp him a hypocrite and a designing knave, that
		  is lying in wait under these characters for the happiness of others. He called
		  in question every truth of religion and then proceeded to shake out of his mind
		  every moral sentiment. He openly avowed that what is called virtue and
		  integrity are deceptions and injurious pretenses.</p>
          <p>It is stated that Holmes was a trouble and a pest to Mr. Ker, Mr.
		  Harris, Mr. Caldwell, and Mr. Gillaspie. He undermined their influence by
		  blaming among the students their acts of discipline. Caldwell tendered his
		  resignation in 1796 because “he perceived that so long as he was to act
		  with a feeble-minded monk (Delvaux), an apostate and skepticized preacher
		  (Holmes), whose little mind was fruitful in every kind of villainy which envy
		  could suggest * * * and the only one in whom he could place dependence was a
		  man whose previous life had not earned him an exalted character (Richards), it
		  required no great sagacity to discover that the public affairs were not to be
		  advantageously conducted.”</p>
          <p>Caldwell further stated that, not content with taking the part of
		  students charged with breaches of the law, Holmes <pb xml:id="p157" n="157"/>
		  constantly vilified and slandered the other professors. In regard to Caldwell
		  he said among the students that indolence and ignorance were his true
		  characters, that he was unprincipled, actuated by mean motives, and a drunkard,
		  and that the more effectually there should be an insurrection against the
		  established authority the better.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this invective, when the subject of it died in Raleigh
		  about six years afterwards Caldwell preached his funeral sermon. It was of such
		  excellence that its publication was called for. I have been unable to procure a
		  copy and have no means of knowing to what extent the preacher modified his
		  unfavorable views, but his journeying twenty-eight miles and the preparation of
		  a written discourse tend to prove that Holmes had discarded his anarchistic
		  views. Moreover the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register,</hi>in which this
		  notice is found, eulogistically states that “for several years past
		  Holmes was a Tutor in the University, in which situation he acquitted himself
		  much to his own credit and with great advantage to the establishment.”
		  The editor mistakes in calling him Tutor, as he was Professor most of his time
		  of service. Remembering that the <hi rend="italics">Register</hi>was a
		  Republican paper, and the extreme bitterness of party spirit, I think it
		  probable that Holmes became a violent Jeffersonian, indulged in the Voltairian,
		  Tom Paine cant of the times, talked swellingly of Big Liberty and the Rights of
		  Man, and his tenets and conduct were misunderstood and distorted by his
		  Federalist colleagues. He probably repented his errors. It was common in those
		  days to talk in the strain of modern anarchists.</p>
          <p>Such differences in the Faculty would have produced discord in quiet
		  times. But the times were not quiet. Fighting and drinking and gambling were
		  almost universally fashionable and of course could not be banished from the
		  microcosm of the University. There was in the air a spirit of revolt against
		  authority, divine and human, which was felt in all circles whether of youth or
		  manhood. Universities and even schools for children found their pupils inclined
		  to recklessness and insubordination, and fathers had little correcting
		  influence because the children were but following their example.</p>
          <p>It is probable also that the spirit of party was a disturbing
		  <pb xml:id="p158" n="158"/>element. Caldwell was a Federalist—possibly others
		  of the Faculty. Certainly soon afterwards the institution was violently
		  attacked in the newspapers and in the Legislature because of their alleged
		  opposition to Democratic principles. Party spirit was so bitter during John
		  Adams' administration, the days of the Alien and Sedition laws, that friendly
		  relations could with difficulty exist between opponents. The followers of
		  Jefferson were charged with seeking to introduce mob-rule and French
		  Red-Republicanism, while they alleged that their opponents were seeking to
		  change our government into a virtual monarchy. Republican students thought it
		  highly patriotic to insult and worry instructors, who, as they thought, were
		  enemies of the rule of the people, seeking to introduce an aristocracy, if not
		  a king.</p>
          <p>This conjecture is sustained by the law passed by the Trustees during
		  that period. “No speech by a student shall have any allusion to party
		  politics. The Faculty shall be responsible that nothing indecent, immoral or
		  profane shall be spoken on the public stage.” The first part of this
		  prohibition was destined to create an insurrection after a few years.</p>
          <p>The difficulty of governing the students by reason of the evil
		  influence of Holmes was increased by the character of the rest of the teaching
		  force. The best of them (Caldwell) was only 27 years of age, and a native of
		  New Jersey, then a month's distance from North Carolina. Gillaspie was a young
		  native of the State, not a graduate of a college, evidently lacking in the
		  sound judgment and tact necessary to overcome these difficulties. The beating
		  of an executive officer is “unthinkable” in our days, and is a sure
		  sign of the want of what is called personal magnetism, however well-intentioned
		  was the officer.</p>
          <p>The other instructors, Webb, Murphey and Flinn, were, as I have said,
		  young men, not yet graduated, although eminently worthy.</p>
          <p>But the most efficient cause of insubordination was the conduct of the
		  Trustees. Instead of entrusting discipline wholly to the Faculty they
		  constantly interfered. The result was to take from the Faculty their sense of
		  full responsibility, and to infuse into the minds of the governed a contempt
		  for their <pb xml:id="p159" n="159"/>authority. Mr. Gillaspie expressed bitterly
		  the views of the Faculty on this subject, in a letter written from
		  Martinsville, February 19, 1800. “When at the University I understood
		  that two of the dismissed students had been re-admitted. This information at
		  first gave me some surprise and induced me to believe that the institution
		  would not be soon enough ruined by the system of measures which had been
		  previously formed. But upon further recollection I found nothing more than a
		  continuation of their resolution to support the students against the Faculty.
		  Such doings and undoings must be productive of the worst effects.” Here
		  was a rebellion, the professors beaten and stoned, exercises broken up for a
		  week, the three chief offenders dismissed, and after about three months two of
		  them, on petition and submission, were re-admitted without consulting the
		  Faculty, by the Trustees, nearly all of whom were politicians. They were good
		  men too, Governor Benjamin Williams, Col. Wm. Polk, Judge Joshua C. Wright, Mr.
		  John Hay, ex-Gov. Samuel Johnston, Mr. Wm. Porter, Gov. Benj. Smith, Mr. Wm.
		  Hinton, Messrs. Wallace and Evan Alexander, Mr. Thomas Wynns, Mr. John Moore
		  (Lincoln), Mr. Thomas Blount. Excellent men, but their actions show that the
		  wisest may err in matters outside their usual callings. Caldwell had strength
		  as he grew older to break up the practice and it has never been resumed.</p>
          <p>Too watchful interference of the Trustees with the internal management
		  of the University is ludicrously shown by a letter from Major Pleasant
		  Henderson, the Steward. In a letter to Walter Alves, Treasurer, he denounces
		  the report of the Committee of Visitation, “that his invariable service
		  of mutton and of bacon too fat to be eaten had nearly starved the boys. This
		  report comes like a thunder-clap on me, because I knew it was founded on
		  information false as hell.” He confesses to “only 11 muttons, about
		  500 pounds, 12 or 13 dinners, about seven pounds apiece for the whole session.
		  Does this look like forcing mutton on them?” Even this small amount was
		  bought because neither beef, shoats nor chickens could be had. The doughty
		  Major admits the fatness of the bacon, but he solemnly asks “could the
		  committee conceive that the middlings should be <pb xml:id="p160" n="160"/>thrown
		  away?” The students had eaten all the hams served to them when vegetables
		  were scarce, and “certainly they ought to have the fatter part.”
		  That the worthy patriot's feelings were cut to the quick is shown by the
		  statement: “Appearances are indicative of, if not ruin, the most severe
		  stroke I ever had.”</p>
          <p>The University shared in the general admiration of the Father of our
		  country. The farewell letter that he wrote to our people on his retirement from
		  the Presidential office in 1797 was ordered to be read publicly to the students
		  twice a year. And when he died on the 14th of December, 1799, the Acting
		  President, Caldwell, delivered an address of such merit that it was by request
		  of the students and Faculty printed for general distribution.</p>
          <p>As Professor James Smiley Gillaspie (I adopt his spelling; indeed
		  Gillespie was universally pronounced Gillaspie) left the University in 1799, I
		  give some facts of his subsequent life. He married Fanny Henderson, a daughter
		  of Samuel Henderson and Elizabeth Calloway. Samuel was a brother of Judge
		  Richard and an uncle of Chief Justice Leonard and of Archibald Henderson.
		  Elizabeth Calloway was one of the three girls, her sister and Daniel Boone's
		  daughter being the others, captured by the Indians and rescued by Boone and
		  others. Mr. Gillaspie became a highly respected Presbyterian minister and with
		  members of the Transylvania colony, of which Richard and Samuel Henderson, with
		  others, were the founders, settled on lands granted the company. His eldest
		  daughter, Fanny, was the first white child born in the limits of Kentucky. He
		  left three daughters and one son, who is ancestor of Mrs. Conway H. Arnold, of
		  Montclair, New Jersey, wife of a Lieutenant in the United States Navy.</p>

          <head>GILLASPIE RETIRES—CALDWELL PRESIDING
		  PROFESSOR—GRADUATES <lb/>TO 1812.</head>
          <p>The difficulty of procuring teachers in our State at the close of the
		  18th century is indicated by the fact that, of the five teachers in the service
		  of the University in 1797, one was a recent citizen of New Jersey, (Caldwell),
		  another, was a French Roman Catholic ex-monk, (Delvaux), a third was a
		  strolling <pb xml:id="p161" n="161"/>player, a deserter from the English mercantile
		  navy, (Richards). The difficulty was chiefly from the meagre salaries offered.
		  The dignity of a teacher's calling was not then, nor for many years afterwards,
		  if ever, properly appreciated, either by parents or the public.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1799, July 5th, the second list of graduates
		  was announced. They were nine in number.</p>
          <p>Francis Nash Williams Burton, Granville; Wm. Dunlap Crawford,
		  Lancaster County, S. C.; Andrew Flinn, Mecklenburg; Samuel Allen Holmes, Chapel
		  Hill; George Washington Long, Halifax; Archibald Debow Murphey, Caswell; John
		  Phifer, Cabarrus; Wm. Morgan Sneed, Granville; Wm. Smith Webb, Granville.</p>
          <p>George M. Marr passed the examinations but did not ask for a degree.
		  Burton, Flinn, Murphey and Phifer were distinguished. Murphey and Flinn were
		  Tutors in the University and Holmes had been a Professor. Flinn rose to be an
		  eminent Presbyterian minister of Charleston, S. C., and was awarded in 1811 the
		  degree of D.D. by this University. Burton was a prominent lawyer. Long died
		  early. Phifer was often State Senator from Cabarrus, as was Sneed from
		  Granville; while Webb became a prominent physician in Tennessee, and Crawford
		  in South Carolina. Marr was a Representative in Congress from Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Of those who did not graduate, are to be noted Hutchins G. Burton, a
		  Representative in the State Legislature and in Congress, Attorney-General, and
		  Governor of North Carolina; Robert Harris, an influential merchant of Salisbury
		  and Sneedsboro, a brother of Charles W. Harris; James Mebane, Maurice Moore,
		  Ebenezer Pettigrew, Planter and Congressman; John Pettigrew, Richard H. Sims, a
		  Tutor in the University and head of the Grammar School; Robert W. Smith, seven
		  times Senator from Cabarrus; James Webb, an eminent physician of Hillsboro and
		  a Trustee of the University. David Gillespie, after his United States Coast
		  Survey Service, was a Representative of Bladen in the Legislature; Richard
		  Eagles and Nicholas Long were influential planters from New Hanover and
		  Franklin counties respectively.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p162" n="162"/>
          <p>A modest beginning was made of granting honorary degrees, the Faculty
		  nominating and the Trustees confirming. The honorary degree of Master of Arts
		  (Artium Magister, A. M.) was conferred on Joseph Caldwell, the new Presiding
		  Professor, Charles Wilson Harris, the first Professor of Mathematics, and
		  Joseph Blount Littlejohn, a member of the Legislature from Chowan. The academic
		  degree of Bachelor of Arts was given to the retiring Presiding Professor James
		  Smiley Gillaspie. This last honor indicates that the recipient was too young
		  and unlearned to be the head of the institution, as he had learned by
		  experience.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1800 was held on June 28th. There was a good
		  attendance of Trustees. Besides Alexander Martin, Richard Bennehan, and David
		  Stone, who were the Committee of Visitation, there were Samuel Johnston, James
		  Hogg, John Haywood, Wm. Polk, Walter Alves, and Evan Alexander.</p>
          <p>The graduates were: William Cherry, Bertie County; John Lawson
		  Henderson, Salisbury; Thomas D. Hunt, Granville County.</p>
          <p>Of these, Cherry had a brilliant but short career as a lawyer and
		  politician. He was a member of the Legislature from Bertie. Henderson was a
		  member of the Legislature from Rowan, State Comptroller, of high character and
		  usefulness, but not the equal of his more distinguished brothers, Chief Justice
		  Leonard Henderson and the leader of the Western Bar, Archibald Henderson. Hunt
		  was a physician.</p>
          <p>Of those matriculating with this class Robert H. Burton, as I have
		  stated, was a Judge; Daniel Newman, a Representative in Congress; William
		  Peace, a much respected merchant of Raleigh, Director of the State Bank
		  forty-five years and founder of Peace Institute.</p>
          <p>Wm. E. Webb was Professor of Ancient Languages 1799-1800, having been
		  a student for several years. After leaving the institution he taught school in
		  Halifax County for a number of years, with reputation. In 1809, 1810 and 1811
		  he was a Commoner from his county in the General Assembly, and from 1809 to
		  1818 was a Trustee of the University.</p>
          <p>Archibald Debow Murphey, a high honor graduate of 1799,
		  <pb xml:id="p163" n="163"/>was Professor of Ancient Languages for the year 1800. He
		  was a native of Caswell, born in 1777, son of a Revolutionary officer. After
		  leaving the University he settled as a lawyer in Hillsboro. From 1812 to 1818
		  he was a State Senator, and as such was the most active of all our public men
		  in promoting a Public School System and Internal Improvements. His report to
		  the Legislature of 1819, on the public school systems of different countries
		  deemed most successful, is a marvel of intelligent labor. From 1818 to 1820 he
		  was a Judge of the Superior Court, and in 1820 he was, under an act since,
		  repealed, a Judge of the Supreme Court for one term as a substitute for Judge
		  Henderson, who had been counsel in important cases then before the court. He
		  was Reporter of the decisions of the old Supreme Court 1804 to 1813, and of the
		  new court in 1818 and 1819. He was a Trustee of the University for thirty
		  years. Shortly before his death he collected valuable material for a history of
		  the State, and to aid him in writing and printing it the General Assembly gave
		  him authority to realize $15,000 by a lottery. This material was used by
		  Joseph Seawell Jones (Shocco) in writing his “Defence of North
		  Carolina” and by President Swain in preparing his “War of the
		  Regulation” and other monographs. Judge Murphey's address before the two
		  societies of the University in 1827 is full of historical information of
		  value.</p>
          <p>A letter from him to President Caldwell, dated December 29, 1808,
		  indicates that, wearied with his professional pursuits, he sometimes longed for
		  the academic shades he had resigned. He regrets that his “prime of
		  life” is spent in vulgar pursuits. The improvement of the mind is
		  suspended, the paths of wisdom are unexplored. He fears he will lose a relish
		  for the pleasures of intellect; what is worse that he will lose that fine tone
		  which the pursuit of knowledge gives to the feelings, and without which the
		  world can afford but little happiness. While not finding fault with Providence,
		  he had often wished that fortune had thrown into his way riches, that he might
		  withdraw from the distractions of petty business and attempt once more to
		  cultivate true knowledge. Fortune has smiled on him since he left the
		  University and he entreats her to continue her friendship <pb xml:id="p164" n="164"/>until she enables him to live in independence and affluence.”
		  Alas! the good man, notwithstanding a most honorable career in public and
		  private life, lost all his property by unfortunate investments and suretyships,
		  and was even subjected for a short while to the indignity of confinement in
		  prison bounds for debt.</p>
          <p>Judge Murphey was always a true and active friend of the University.
		  In the scholarly report on Public Education above-mentioned he is emphatic in
		  testifying to its good work and in advocating State aid in its behalf. I give
		  some of his language: “This institution has been eminently useful to the
		  State. It has contributed, perhaps more than any other cause, to diffuse a
		  taste for reading among the people, and excite a spirit of liberal improvement.
		  It has contributed to change our manners and elevate our character.” He
		  then urges the construction of three additional buildings, i. e., two
		  dormitories and one for library and apparatus; that a library and suitable
		  apparatus be purchased, that two professorships be endowed and that six
		  additional teachers be provided. “When former prejudices have died away,
		  when liberal ideas begin to prevail, when the pride of the State is awakened
		  and an honorable ambition is cherished for her glory, an appeal is made to the
		  patriotism and the generous feelings of the Legislature in favor of an
		  institution which in all civilized nations has been regarded as the nursery of
		  moral greatness and the palladium of civil liberty. That people who cultivate
		  the sciences and the arts with most success acquire a most enviable superiority
		  over others. Learned men by their discoveries and their works give a lasting
		  splendor to national character; and such is the enthusiasm of man that there is
		  not an individual, however humble in life his lot may be, who does not feel
		  himself blessed to belong to a country honored with great men and magnificent
		  institutions. It is due to North Carolina, it is due to the great man (General
		  Davie) who first proposed the foundation of the University, to foster it with
		  parental fondness and to give it an importance commensurate with the high
		  destinies of the State.”</p>
          <p>The graduates of the first year of the Nineteenth century (1801)
		  triples those of the last year of the Eighteenth. They <pb xml:id="p165" n="165"/>
		  were: Thomas Gale Amis, Northampton County; Thomas Davis Bennehan, Orange
		  County; John Branch, Halifax County; William McKenzie Clark, Martin County;
		  Francis Little Dancy, Edgecombe County; John Davis Hawkins, Franklin County;
		  Thomas D. King, Sampson County; Archibald Lytle, Tennessee; Wm. Hardy Murfree,
		  Hertford County.</p>
          <p>Amis had a very large brain and won distinction in his studies. He
		  afterwards sailed from Charleston without disclosing his object, and was
		  nevermore heard from. Bennehan was a wealthy farmer of Orange, a Trustee of the
		  University, and at Farintosh, his residence, dispensed a bounteous hospitality;
		  Branch, Governor of this State and of the Territory of Florida, and Secretary
		  of the Navy under Jackson; Dancy, a lawyer of much reputation; Hawkins was
		  often a legislator, fifty years a Trustee of the University, one of the
		  foremost in building the Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad. Murfree, founder of
		  Murfreesboro, was a grandfather of the eminent Southern novelist, Mary Noailles
		  Murfree who, under the pen name of Charles Egbert Craddock, has so faithfully
		  and impressively delineated the characters of our mountaineers and the beauty
		  and grandeur of the Alleghanies. He was son of Colonel Hardy Murfree, who aided
		  in the daring and successful storming of Stony Point. Clark was a planter,
		  brother of the grandfather of Chief Justice Walter Clark. King, probably an
		  elder brother of Vice-President William Rufus King, represented Sampson County
		  in the Legislature.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduating matriculates with this class, Jesse Cobb was a
		  man of ability. Removing to Tennessee he became the founder of an influential
		  family, one of whom, William Cobb, became Governor of that State. Nathaniel W.
		  Williams was a Judge of the Superior Court of Tennessee; Johnston Blakely, as
		  Captain of the Wasp, captured the Reindeer, for which a gold medal was voted by
		  Congress. He also captured the Atlanta, and was lost at sea with his vessel.
		  John Goode was a lawyer in Virginia.</p>
          <p>Of the Commencement speakers President Caldwell notes that “some
		  portrayed in language at once splendid and elegant the excellence of a
		  Republican form of government and described <pb xml:id="p166" n="166"/>the glory of
		  the American Revolution in glowing colors.” In the figurative language of
		  a later date they evidently “flew a magnificent spread eagle.”</p>
          <p>The Tutor for 1800 and up to 1804 was Richard Henderson. He was the
		  son of a brother of Chief Justice Henderson, who emigrated to Kentucky to
		  settle on lands sold to the Transylvania Company by the Indians, which sale was
		  repudiated by the States of North Carolina and Virginia, but 400,000 acres
		  being allowed them by way of compromise. The son was a man of worth and
		  talents. After being principal of the Academy in Hillsboro he returned to his
		  native State and became a prominent lawyer. The Trustees gave him the degree of
		  A.B., though he had not passed his examinations, because they were satisfied
		  with his classical and scientific training while Tutor.</p>
          <p>In 1802 P. Celestine Molie was employed to teach French for one year.
		  Nothing is known of him except that, like most foreigners instructing our youth
		  in early days, he was the subject of merciless ridicule and frequent insults.
		  Probably he was either a French emigré or a refugee from Hayti.</p>
          <p>Professor Murphey was succeeded in 1801 by one who has profoundly
		  influenced for good this and other States—Rev. Wm. Bingham, an honor
		  graduate of the University of Glasgow, a Scotch-Irishman of Ulster. He
		  emigrated about 1788 on account of political troubles, landed in Delaware, but
		  soon removed to Wilmington, N. C. He here preached and established a classical
		  school. I have mentioned that he was among the first subscribers to the
		  inauguration of the University. As many of the wealthier inhabitants of the
		  lower Cape Fear either settled permanently or spent their summers on the hills
		  of Chatham, he transferred his school about 1795 to Pittsboro, and remained
		  there until his removal to the University.</p>
          <p>After resigning his professorship in 1805 he re-opened his school at
		  Pittsboro, but, concluding that Hillsboro had a larger future, removed it to
		  that town in 1808. Probably on account of the drunkenness and rowdyism
		  attending court towns he soon bought a plantation five miles north of Mebane,
		  named it Mount Repose, and, erecting a school house of logs, there taught until
		  his death in 1825.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p167" n="167"/>
          <p>Wm. Bingham was a man of force, high purpose, and power of influencing
		  others. According to the recollection of Hon. Giles Mebane, once Speaker of the
		  Senate, he was “about five feet six inches tall, with no surplus flesh,
		  weighing 150 or 160 pounds; very quick and brisk in his movements, walking
		  erect like a well-drilled soldier. He was bald, the boys nicknaming him
		  “Old Slick.” He walked three miles to church on Sundays, leading
		  his boarders. He was reasonably talkative, and sometimes jocose, but never
		  undignified.”</p>
          <p>His wife was Annie Jean, daughter of Colonel Slingsby, of the English
		  Army, who was stationed at Wilmington during the Revolutionary War, highly
		  regarded by the Americans for humanity and justice. Colonel Slingby's family
		  remained in Wilmington after the declaration of peace.</p>
          <p>Professor Bingham left several children, the most prominent being Wm.
		  James, born at Chapel Hill in the house built for the President. On his
		  father's death he gave up his chosen profession of the law and took up the
		  school work at Mount Repose, but soon removed to Hillsboro and thence to a farm
		  called Oaks in western Orange. He advanced still further the fame of the
		  Bingham School, and handed it on to his sons, Colonels William and Robert
		  Bingham, whose reputation as teachers extends throughout the Southern States.
		  Professor Bingham's grandson, Wm. Bingham Lynch, of Florida, is likewise an
		  eminent teacher, while the husband of a great-granddaughter, Preston Gray, is
		  Principal of a flourishing academy called the Wm. Bingham School.</p>
          <p>Dr. Caldwell has left a noble tribute to the character of Mr. Bingham,
		  the elder. He wrote, “His qualifications and virtues were of that
		  unobtrusive, but substantial cast, which merit and must secure the respect of
		  every upright and generous bosom. Whoever shall have occasion to be acquainted
		  with this man shall find him to be one of those whom the great poet of England
		  has denominated to be among ‘The noblest works of God.’ ”</p>
          <p>It was charged by a bitter partisan that Mr. Bingham was driven from
		  the University because of his being a Republican in politics. Dr. Caldwell
		  emphatically denied this. He asserted <pb xml:id="p168" n="168"/>“Mr. Bingham
		  was never exiled from the University. His virtues were too sound and
		  irreproachable for men of any political principles even to feel disposed to
		  injure him. When Mr. Bingham left us I can assure ‘Citizen’ that
		  his good qualities were not unknown to the Trustees or the Faculty.” By
		  “Citizen” he meant an anonymous critic of the University.</p>
          <p>The graduates of 1802 were Adlai Laurens Osborne, of Rowan; George
		  Washington Thornton, of Virginia; and Carey Whitaker, of Halifax County. All
		  were praised for proficiency in studies. Osborne became a lawyer in full
		  practice. Thornton was a physician.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates not graduating Jeremiah Battle was a physician of
		  prominence in Tarboro and Raleigh, and author of valuable medical monographs;
		  John Rutherford London, of Wilmington, a lawyer, planter and President of the
		  Bank of Cape Fear; John Duncan Toomer, a member of the Legislature, Judge of
		  the Superior and Supreme Courts.</p>
          <p>Of the examination at the Commencement of 1802 we have a full report
		  by the Committee of Trustees, Messrs. Adlai Osborne, lawyer and Clerk of the
		  Superior Court of Rowan, Henry Potter, afterwards for many years Judge of the
		  United States District Court, a Trustee of the University from 1799 until his
		  death in 1856, and Charles W. Harris, lawyer at Halifax, late Professor, the
		  report being doubtless written by Harris. In the Preparatory School there were
		  the following classes, two in Reading and Spelling, two in Webster's Grammar,
		  one in Arithmetic to the Rule of Three, one in Latin Grammar, one in Cordery,
		  one in Latin Grammar, Aesop's Fables and Eutropius, one in <choice><sic>Eramus</sic><corr>Erasmus</corr></choice>, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Selectae de Profanis</foreign>
		  and Vocables, one in Cæsar, one in Latin Introduction, one in Sallust,
		  one in Ovid and Virgil's Eclogues, one in French Grammar, two in French Fables,
		  two in Telemachus, one in Gil Blas, one in Voltaire and Racine. It will be
		  difficult to show in modern days a better program of studies.</p>
          <p>The Freshman class of the University proper was examined in three
		  studies, Virgil, Latin Introduction and Greek Testament; the Sophomore class in
		  Cicero, Geography, Arithmetic, Webster's Grammar, Syntax and Lowth's Grammar;
		  the Junior <pb xml:id="p169" n="169"/>class in Ewing's Synopsis, Algebra and
		  Ferguson's Astronomy; the Seniors in Adams' Defence and DeLolme on the English
		  Constitution. In the next year, 1803, by the Freshman class, in addition to
		  Virgil, the Odes of Horace were studied and the Dialogues of Lucian in the
		  place of the Greek Testament; in the Sophomore, the Satires, Epistles and Art
		  of Poetry of Horace were added; in the Junior Algebra, Euclid, Trigonometry,
		  Heights and Distances, Navigation and Logarithms, were in the place of
		  Astronomy; in the Senior class Blair's Lectures, Millot's Elements of History
		  and Paley's Moral Philosophy were substituted for Adams and DeLolme.</p>
          <p>The graduates of 1803 were: Chesley Daniel, Halifax County; William P.
		  Hall, Halifax County; Matthew Troy, Salisbury.</p>
          <p>Daniel was a teacher and a member of the Legislature; Hall was a
		  teacher; Troy was a lawyer of standing, after being a Tutor in the University
		  Grammar School.</p>
          <p>Of those who matriculated with them, Joel Battle was a planter and
		  cotton manufacturer, one of the first in the State, his factory on Tar river
		  beginning to work in 1820; Thomas H. Hall. a physician and Representative in
		  the State Legislature and sixteen years in Congress; George Phifer. of Cabarrus
		  County. a merchant and planter; Lemuel Sawyer, a representative in the State
		  Legislature and sixteen years in Congress, a Presidential Elector and an
		  author; Thomas Hart Benton, a member of the Tennessee Legislature, United
		  States Senator from Missouri for thirty years, author; Joseph Hawkins, State
		  Comptroller, Senator from Warren; Robert C. Hilliard, member of the Legislature
		  from Nash; Richmond Pearson, an enlightened agriculturist, father of Chief
		  Justice Pearson; Fleming Saunders, Judge of the General Court of Virginia.</p>
          <p>In 1804 the number of graduates advanced to six: Richard Armistead,
		  Plymouth; Thomas Brown, Bladen County; Richard Henderson, Kentucky; Atlas
		  Jones, Moore County; Willie William Jones, Halifax County; James Sneed,
		  Granville County.</p>
          <p>Of these, Henderson has been already described. Willie William Jones,
		  son of Willie Jones, of Revolutionary fame, was a physician in Raleigh and a
		  Trustee of his Alma Mater. He was <pb xml:id="p170" n="170"/>the donor of the site
		  of the First Methodist church. Atlas Jones, son of Edmund Jones, one of the
		  University donors, was a Tutor in the U. of N. C. and a Trustee, a lawyer and
		  member of the Legislature from Moore County. The humorous lawyer, long a
		  popular Representative in the Legislature from Anson, Atlas J. Dargan, was
		  named for him. Sneed was a physician.</p>
          <p>We are fortunately in the possession of the recollections of Dr. Wm.
		  Hooper, who entered the Preparatory Department in 1804. The Faculty consisted
		  of President Caldwell, Prof. Bingham and Tutor Henderson. The President was
		  known among the students as “Old Joe,” though only thirty years of
		  age and extremely active. Bingham's nickname “Old Slick” was
		  because of the glossiness of his hairless scalp. Henderson's small size
		  suggested his nickname, Little Dick. Matthew Troy and Chesley Daniel presided
		  over the Preparatory Department. All things were fashioned after the model of
		  Princeton, which probably imitated the Scottish universities. Students were
		  required to rise at daylight in the winter and to go to prayers by candlelight.
		  Troy taught the Jugurtha and Cataline of Sallust and and to a well-behaved boy
		  was kindly, but quick with the lash on the idle and the wicked.</p>
          <p>In the University proper Greek was required for a degree first in
		  1804. Thirty dialogues of Lucian were at first sufficient. It was thought
		  necessary to have a native Frenchman to teach properly his language, and
		  “to torment him and amuse themselves with his transports of rage and
		  broken English, was a regular part of the college fun.” Chemistry and
		  Differential and Integral Calculus were not in the course.</p>
          <p>The South Building was still unfinished. The rough huts of the
		  students in the corners, picturesque but unbeautiful, were still quiet retreats
		  in fair weather, but the skill of the occupants was not sufficient to protect
		  them from rain.</p>
          <p>The Junior and Senior classes only recited once a day. Geometry was
		  studied from a manuscript copy of a treatise by Dr. Caldwell, which at a
		  subsequent period was printed. The copies of this made by the students swarmed
		  with errors, which fact was often alleged as an excuse for ignorance. The
		  Junior recitation was at 11 o'clock, after which some took to their
		  <pb xml:id="p171" n="171"/>books, some stole off to hunting or fishing, while
		  others would make up a party for a dinner at James Craig's, called in
		  distinction from the habitation of a man of the same name on the Durham road,
		  “Fur (or far) Craig's.” This was of chicken-pie or fried chicken
		  with biscuits and coffee, costing twenty-five cents a head, and was eagerly
		  enjoyed as vastly superior to the ordinary meals at Commons.</p>
          <p>According to the recollections of Dr. Hooper the Commencement of 1804
		  fell on the 4th of July, and it was duly celebrated by the students. Thomas
		  Brown, of Bladen, was elected General and Orator, and Hyder Ali Davie second in
		  command, by the whole body of students. Says Dr. Hooper: “All things
		  being duly arranged the General, clad in full regimentals, with cocked hat and
		  dancing red plume, placed himself at the head of his troops, (for we were all
		  trained into soldiers for the nonce), and marched up to the foot of the
		  ‘Big Poplar’ where was placed for him a rostrum, which he mounted,
		  and all the military disposing themselves before him, he gracefully took off
		  his plumed helmet and made profound obeisance to the army. I can tell you
		  nothing of the graduating class or their speeches. My childish fancy was taken
		  up with the military display, though we had no music to march to but the drum
		  and the fife.”</p>
          <p>If Dr. Hooper's memory did not fail him, the march of General Brown or
		  his oration was in addition to the program of the Faculty. The following is the
		  official statement:</p>
          <p>Representatives of the two societies were to deliver orations on the
		  4th of July in honor of the day. These were Green H. Campbell, Cadwallader
		  Jones, Wm. B. Meares, David Hay, Thomas Davis and John Taylor.</p>
          <p>On the 7th of July, Saturday, ten pupils of the Preparatory School
		  were to compete for first honor, they having already obtained equal distinction
		  in scholarship. Wm. Hooper is one of these.</p>
          <p>On the evening of Monday, the 9th, the members of the Senior class in
		  the Preparatory School were to pronounce orations. Thomas Hawkins had the first
		  Salutatory in Latin; Alexius Foster, the second Salutatory in English; John
		  Brown, <pb xml:id="p172" n="172"/>the Valedictory, their scholarship being equal.
		  Lewis Duke had the first intermediate oration, William Henderson, the second,
		  and John Hooper, the third.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday, the day before Commencement, fourteen students from the
		  Establishment, i. e., the University proper, were to pronounce orations.</p>
          <p>On the forenoon of Wednesday, the 12th of July, the day of
		  Commencement, the members of the Junior class made their speeches. They were
		  eight in number.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon the Senior class delivered their orations. Mr. Willie
		  Wm. Jones, “having the greatest pretensions,” had the Latin
		  Salutatory, which was the prize speech until 1838.</p>
          <p>To Mr. Atlas Jones, being second, was assigned the Oration in
		  History.</p>
          <p>To Mr. Thomas Brown, the Valedictory, he being third in order.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Richard Armistead and James Sneed delivered orations of their
		  own choice.</p>
          <p>It should be noticed that the prefix “Mr.” was only given
		  to members of the graduating class. I cannot find when this contraction of
		  Magister descended to the youngest Freshman; about the time perhaps when girls
		  of ten or eleven in boarding schools obtained from the teachers the prefix of
		  Miss (contracted from Mistress or Magisteress) as a handle to their surnames.
		  It is now fashionable in the larger universities to substitute Mr. for the
		  titles, once prized, of Professor or Dr. The Preparatory School was considered
		  an integral part of the institution and therefore had a place in the
		  exercises.</p>
          <p>In this year began the practice of assigning special addresses to the
		  highest honor men. Moreover it was ordained that the Seniors should wear
		  uniforms of neat, plain homespun cloth, and the hope was expressed that their
		  example of Patriotism and Economy will be imitated hereafter. This was an
		  evidence of the deep feelings of resentment against England and France, which
		  led to the Embargo and Non-Intercourse Acts of Congress.</p>

          <head>CALDWELL PRESIDENT—DAVIE LEAVES THE STATE—UNIVERSITY
		  <lb/>LIFE.</head>
          <p>It has been mentioned that the Trustees had such an opinion of the
		  dignity of the office of President of the University that the appointment was
		  postponed from time to time. By 1804 Caldwell had shown such zeal and
		  intelligence as Presiding Professor that it was evident to all that “the
		  Hour and the Man” had come. The following ordinance, prepared by two of
		  the ablest members of the Board, Wm. Gaston and Duncan Cameron, was adopted
		  unanimously and similarly confirmed at the regular December meeting:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>Whereas, experience has manifested the necessity of having a President
		  of the University, and it is doubtful whether the Trustees have the power of
		  making a permanent appointment except at an annual meeting.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italics">Be it therefore ordained,</hi>That a President of
		  the University of North Carolina be appointed to hold office until the next
		  annual meeting of the Trustees, and that the said President discharge all those
		  duties which have heretofore been annexed to the office of Presiding
		  Professor.</p>
          </q>
          <p>It was declared beneath the dignity of the President to be dependent
		  on tuition fees, and a salary of 500 pounds or $1,000 was voted him.</p>
          <p>A ballot being had Rev. Joseph Caldwell was unanimously elected. As a
		  Trustee said at the time the choice was on account of his great talents and
		  steady attachment to the University.</p>
          <p>At the next annual meeting the election was made permanent.</p>
          <p>The choice was most happy. Caldwell was a man of enlarged views, a
		  scholar especially in the realm of Mathematics, with a mind eager for the
		  acquisition of knowledge in all directions. He had the widest sympathy in all
		  enterprises promising to be beneficial to the institutions of the State. He was
		  a preacher of power. He was utterly fearless, indefatigable in the discharge of
		  every duty, skillful in the administration of the discipline in those days
		  deemed best, and which may have been demanded by the prevailing social habits.
		  He inspired respect, confidence, and, among the disorderly, fear. He was strong
		  of arm and swift of foot, and thought it not undignified to engage in a wrestle
		  or race with midnight disturbers. Above all the <pb xml:id="p174" n="174"/>Trustees
		  had such implicit reliance on his wisdom and devotion to the interests of the
		  institution that they gradually abandoned the pernicious practice of
		  interfering in the discipline and allowed the Faculty, under his dominating
		  influence, full freedom of action. Henceforth, while the habit of interfering
		  with the internal government was not for several years totally eradicated, yet,
		  whenever he showed decided displeasure, they surrendered to his will.</p>
          <p>The President was still to fill the Chair of Mathematics. Wm. Bingham
		  was Professor of the Ancient Languages. Atlas Jones was his Tutor of all
		  work.</p>
          <p>The President was elected a member of the Board of Trustees.</p>
          <p>It was natural that, invested with as great autocratic power as he was
		  willing then to wield, he should assimilate the institution under his charge to
		  his alma mater. Steps were taken in this direction at once. The Trustees
		  ordained that no degree should be granted without a knowledge of Greek. No
		  student should enter the Junior class without passing an examination in 30
		  Dialogues of Lucian, Xenophen's Cyropedia and four books of the Iliad, the
		  Sophomore class of that year being allowed to pass on the Gospels of Matthew
		  and Luke, and the Senior class of the next year being allowed to substitute
		  French for Greek.</p>
          <p>For entrance into the Freshman class thereafter the applicant must
		  pass on Greek Grammar, Cornelius Nepos or <foreign xml:lang="lat">Selectae de
		  Profanis</foreign>. These were to be taught in the Preparatory School. The
		  ordinance for granting degrees for English branches and the Sciences was
		  repealed.</p>
          <p>To add dignity to Commencement exercises it was ordained that the
		  President should wear a black gown.</p>
          <p>A year after the election of President Caldwell he made an
		  unsuccessful effort to induce Rev. Marcus George, of the Warrenton Academy, to
		  accept the Chair of Ancient Languages. He stated that he had heard of the
		  differences between Mr. George and his Trustees, arising from their
		  interference with his management in presence of the pupils and before the
		  public eye. The past struggles of the University were alluded to. They
		  <pb xml:id="p175" n="175"/>sometimes threaten to terminate its existence, but
		  “amidst the darkest prospects it has always recovered with more certain
		  strength.” Now it seemed to be almost out of reach of danger. Mr. George
		  was the teacher of Chief Justice Ruffin, Weldon N. Edwards, and other eminent
		  men, and had their unqualified regard.</p>
          <p>Caldwell gives the number of students at seventy, more than ever
		  before in the University proper. The salary offered is $333.33 from the
		  Treasury and $7.50 from each student, amounting to more than $850
		  a year, paid semi-annually in advance. He added that no self-interest prompted
		  his letter, because as long as the vacancy should continue two-thirds of the
		  $850 would be added to his own salary, which implies that he was
		  temporarily teaching the classes studying the classics, as well as those in his
		  own department of Mathematics.</p>
          <p>In a letter written to a friend in Connecticut, whose name is not
		  known, the President gives a short resume of his life since leaving Princeton
		  in 1796. It has a tone of sadness but firm resolve. “The difficulties,
		  trials and anxieties” he encountered were too numerous to be recorded
		  within a short compass. He tells of the recent death of his daughter and wife,
		  adding, “Such is the fallacy of human expectations and the transition of
		  present happiness.” Treasurer Haywood, in a letter written at the same
		  period, thus consoles him: “Resignation, Religion and Time must be relied
		  on as the best Balm for the Heart torn and wounded by privations of the tender
		  and distressing kind you experience.”</p>
          <p>It was not many months after his elevation to the Presidency before
		  Caldwell received a flattering call to the Professorship of Mathematics and
		  Natural Philosophy in the College of South Carolina. It was conveyed by a
		  Trustee, Judge Wm. Johnson, of the Supreme Court of the United States, a fellow
		  student at Princeton, who stated that the salary as Professor was $1,500
		  per annum, and for preaching in the Chapel $500 was offered by the
		  citizens of Columbia. The expectation was expressed that he would soon become
		  President with a salary of $2,500 and a house.</p>
          <p>There was much consternation among the friends of the University
		  <pb xml:id="p176" n="176"/>of North Carolina at this offer. Treasurer Haywood
		  wrote: “I cannot but hope as a North Carolinian, that your attachment to
		  the infant institution of which you have the care, and other considerations
		  growing out of the remembrance of the anxious and fatherly part you have taken
		  in its <choice><sic>continuace</sic><corr>continuance</corr></choice>and prosperity for years past
		  and in the days of its greatest trials and adversity, will lead you rather to
		  consult your feelings than your interest.” * * * “Remain with us
		  and go on to cherish and strengthen the child of your adoption by a continuance
		  of those parental cares and attentions which have so greatly contributed to the
		  support of its infancy.” The members of the Senior class, Green H.
		  Campbell, John L. Taylor, John R. Donnell, John C. Montgomery, Gavin Hogg and
		  Stephen Davis, appealed to him in affectionate and laudatory terms, certifying
		  to the ability and the fairness of his administration. Among other things they
		  say “you have been the director of our youthful pursuits, our guide, our
		  teacher and our friend.”</p>
          <p>The Board of Trustees unanimously passed resolutions urging on him the
		  irreparable loss, which the University would sustain by his leaving it. The
		  result was, as he wrote to his Connecticut correspondent, that finding his
		  attachment grow to the place and disliking changes he declined the
		  appointment.</p>
          <p>Graduates of 1805 were Benjamin Franklin Hawkins, Warren County;
		  Joseph Warren Hawkins, Warren County; Spruce Macay Osborne, Mecklenburg
		  County.</p>
          <p>Of these, Joseph W. Hawkins was a physician and one of the promoters
		  and Directors of the Raleigh &amp; Gaston Railroad; Benjamin F. Hawkins was
		  often Senator and Commoner from Franklin; Osborne was a surgeon U. S. A.,
		  killed at Fort Mims.</p>
          <p>Of the contemporaneous matriculates, Joseph John Daniel was a member
		  of the Legislature, a Presidential Elector, a Judge of the Superior and Supreme
		  Courts, a delegate to the Convention of 1835; John H. Hawkins was often a
		  member of the Legislature from Warren; William Rufus King, a member of the
		  Legislature and of Congress from North Carolina, member of the Convention of
		  Alabama of 1819, United States Senator, Minister to France, Vice-President U.
		  S. A.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p177" n="177"/>
          <p>In this year the State and the University lost the valuable services
		  of William Richardson Davie. He had a career of uninterrupted success until
		  1802, when he was overwhelmed by the wave of Jeffersonian Republicanism which
		  swept over the State. He was defeated, as any Federalist would have been, by a
		  much inferior man, Philip W. Alston. Ardent as he was in his political
		  opinions, the pathway to official or Congressional usefulness was closed for an
		  indefinite period. Practice at the bar, of which he was one of the acknowledged
		  leaders, had no attractions to compensate him for the tedious journeys, often
		  in fervid heat or piercing cold or dismal rains, in perils of high waters, over
		  roads deep in sand or mud or cut up by dangerous chasms. An uncle, for whom he
		  was named, who supplied the place of a father, dying when he was a child, had
		  bequeathed to him a plantation in Lancaster County, South Carolina, on the
		  banks of the Catawba, near the line of the county of Mecklenburg, with a proper
		  complement of slaves, and he resolved to retire from public life and spend his
		  remaining years in the quiet and ease of a country gentleman. We have a letter
		  from him June 9, 1805, saddened in spirit, of which I give extracts. After
		  mentioning that he had returned from South Carolina on the 5th he adds:
		  “I have now again been two months on the road and return perfectly worn
		  down. My constitution cannot now bear that degree of suffering, privation and
		  incessant toil which, when I enjoyed youth and health, gave me spirits and
		  pleasure. Everything must yield to Time, and I have submitted with as good a
		  grace as possible. My plan of life is to be completely changed, and those
		  measures which are leading me to a Repose I have long sighed for, and which is
		  becoming every day more necessary for me, are to commence this fall. The plan
		  involves some painful sacrifices, but they are necessary and indispensable. A
		  separation from friends to whom my heart has been tenderly attached for many
		  years is among the most painful of all these. I anticipate it, I feel it, as a
		  prelude to that last separation to which the laws of our Nature compel us to
		  submit.”</p>
          <p>He was much concerned at the attacks on the University by the General
		  Assembly and chagrined at the inferiority of North <pb xml:id="p178" n="178"/>to
		  South Carolina in respect for higher education. He wrote: “the friends of
		  science in the other States regard the people of North Carolina as a sort of
		  semi-barbarians, among whom neither learning, virtue nor men of science possess
		  any estimation. In South Carolina a professorship is more eagerly canvassed for
		  than the Secretaryship of the government of the United States, the consequence
		  of that liberal spirit which has been displayed by their assembly. After a
		  handsome and permanent endowment of the offices of the institution they voted
		  $10,000 to purchase a library and philosophical apparatus. What a
		  contrast! Poor North Carolina!” We must believe that Davie shared in the
		  contempt which Federalist leaders generally had for the victorious Republicans,
		  and this feeling prompted these bitter words.</p>
          <p>The prosperity of the University was still in his thoughts. He advised
		  that the choice of the new Professor of Languages should be given to the
		  President, and that as a rule he should select all inferior officers, as the
		  whole responsibility rested on him.</p>
          <p>After his removal to South Carolina Davie was never induced to emerge
		  from the retirement of a country gentleman, except to be President of the State
		  Agricultural Society. During the War of 1812 he was tendered the position of
		  Major-General, and the Senate confirmed the nomination. His constitution had
		  been too much undermined to allow him to accept it. He died November 8, 1820,
		  leaving a reputation as a soldier, a statesman, a lawyer and broad-minded
		  citizen, of which the University and the State are proud.</p>
          <p>Lt.-Gov. Francis D. Winston sends me a letter written July 31, 1816,
		  by General Jeremiah Slade, long State Senator from Martin County, to his son
		  Alfred, a student in the University, containing an eulogy on Davie, which shows
		  the strong hold he had on his party friends. After praising the location of the
		  University as eminently suitable to study, he says: “This leads me to
		  regard with feelings of admiration little short of adoration the character of
		  the father of the institution, Wm. R. Davie, who with a flow of eloquence which
		  did honor to his head, and a sympathy which did honor to his heart (for he shed
		  <pb xml:id="p179" n="179"/>tears at the prospect of a failure of the Bill of
		  Incorporation as freely as a father would for the loss of a favorite child), he
		  bore down the powerful opposition, which was raised against the bill. And
		  altho' we greatly admire the site of his choice, yet we still more wonder how
		  he should have discovered it. * * * After the Act of Incorporation was granted
		  it was by his exertions that the institution went into operation. * * * You may
		  be led to inquire why so great and so good a man should bury himself in the
		  shades of retirement. It was at the time when mad Democracy got the upper hand
		  of the Constitution and the Washingtonian administration, he pursued the
		  dictates of that sound maxim, ‘when rogues bare sway the post of honor is
		  a private station.’ ”</p>
          <p>Andrew Rhea, Professor of Ancient Languages from 1806 to 1814, was a
		  Virginian. He is described by Davie in 1797 as “said to be of middle age
		  with a family, of six years experience in teaching, and highly spoken
		  of.” He seems to have escaped animadversion but has left no traditional
		  reputation as to learning or teaching powers. That he was a widower is proved
		  by his being required to sleep in the University Building and preside at the
		  Steward's table. The <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register</hi>says he was a
		  very distinguished scholar, but Dr. Hooper describes him as “a
		  good-natured, indolent man.” I give some reminiscences of Dr. Hooper,
		  found in his address at the University in 1859, during the visit of President
		  Buchanan. He was a student in the Preparatory Department and then entered the
		  University in 1806.</p>
          <p>“As the only dormitory that had a roof was too crowded for
		  study, many students left their rooms as a place of study entirely, and built
		  cabins in the corners of the unfinished brick walls of the South Building, and
		  quite comfortable cabins they were. In such a cabin they hibernated and burned
		  their mid-night oil. As soon as spring brought back the swallows and the
		  leaves, they emerged from their den and chose some shady retirement where they
		  made a path and a promenade, and in that embowered promenade all diligent
		  students of those days had to follow the steps of science, to wrestle with its
		  difficulties, and to treasure up their best equipments: Ye remnants of the
		  Peripatetic School!</p>
          <pb xml:id="p180" n="180"/>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“Ah, ye can tell how hard it is to climb </p>
            <p>The steep where fame's proud temple shines afar!”</p>
          </q>
          <p>“They lived <hi rend="italics">sub divo,</hi>like the birds
		  that caroled over their heads. “But how,” you will say, “did
		  they manage in rainy weather?” Well, nothing was more common than, on a
		  rainy day, to send in a petition to be excused from recitation, which petition
		  ran in this stereotype phrase: “The inclemency of the weather rendering
		  it impossible to prepare the recitation, the Sophomore class respectfully
		  request Mr. Rhea to excuse them from recitation this afternoon.” The
		  petitions were granted.</p>
          <p>The following relates to studies in the Junior class: “The
		  Juniors had their first taste of Geometry, in a little elementary treatise,
		  drawn up by Dr. Caldwell, in manuscript, and not then printed. Copies were to
		  be had only by transcribing, and in process of time they, of course, were
		  swarming with errors. But this was a decided advantage to the Junior, who stuck
		  to his text, without minding his diagram. For, if he happened to say that the
		  angle at A was equal to the angle of B, when in fact the diagram showed no
		  angle at B at all, but one at C, if Doctor Caldwell corrected him, he had it
		  always in his power to say: “Well, that was what I thought myself, but it
		  ain't so in the book, and I thought you knew better than I.” We may well
		  suppose that the Doctor was completely silenced by this unexpected application
		  of the argumentum ad hominem.”</p>
          <p>“Greek, after its introduction, became the bug-bear of college.
		  Having been absent when my class began it, I heard, on my return, such a
		  terrific account of it that I no more durst encounter the Greeks than Xerxes
		  when he fled in consternation across the Hellespont, after the battle of
		  Salamis. Rather than lose my degree, however, after two years I plucked up
		  courage and set doggedly and desperately to work, prepared hastily thirty
		  Dialogues of Lucian, and on that stock of Greek was permitted to graduate. As
		  for Chemistry and Differential and Integral Calculus and all that, we never
		  heard of such hard things. They had not then crossed the Roanoke, nor did they
		  appear among us till they were brought in by the Northern barbarians about the
		  year 1818.” The Doctor alludes to the <pb xml:id="p181" n="181"/>coming of
		  Professor Mitchell, who for a time had charge of Mathematics.</p>
          <p>Graduates of 1806: John Adams Cameron, Virginia; Durant Hatch, Junior,
		  Jones County; James Henderson, Kentucky; James Martin, Stokes County.</p>
          <p>The first honor was awarded to Cameron, the second to Martin.</p>
          <p>Cameron was a member of the Legislature, a Major in the War of 1812,
		  Consul to Vera Cruz; Judge of the United States District Court of Florida. He
		  was lost at sea in journeying from Savannah to New York. He was a brother of
		  Judge Duncan Cameron.</p>
          <p>James Martin was a son of Col. James Martin, of the Revolution, who
		  was one of the Commissioners to locate the State Capital—hence Martin
		  street. After spending a year at the University as Tutor, he settled in
		  Salisbury as a lawyer and had a wide reputation. He was Superior Court Judge
		  from 1826 to 1835, and Senator from Rowan in 1823. He was a Trustee of the
		  University from 1823 to 1836, the last year probably being the date of his
		  removal to Mobile, Alabama. He became Judge of the Circuit Court of his adopted
		  State.</p>
          <p>Of the others, Hatch was a planter, and Henderson a physician in
		  Kentucky.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduating contemporaneous matriculates, Wm. Belvidere
		  Meares was a prominent lawyer and member of the Legislature; Archibald H.
		  Sneed, a Major U. S. A.; James Young, of Granville, a physician; John Burgess
		  Baker, a physician and a member of the Legislature from Gates; Cullen Battle, a
		  prominent physician and planter, first in this State and then in Alabama; James
		  Smith Battle, an influential planter in Edgecombe County; Thomas Burgess, a
		  lawyer of large practice in Halifax; William C. Love, of Chapel Hill, a
		  Representative in Congress from the Salisbury District; William Miller, member
		  of the Legislature, Speaker of the House, Attorney-General, Governor, Charge
		  d'Affaires to Guatemala.</p>
          <p>In 1807 the honor was conferred on President Caldwell of being
		  selected by the Commission as the astronomical expert to finish running the
		  boundary line between North Carolina, <pb xml:id="p182" n="182"/>South Carolina and
		  Georgia. Governor Nathaniel Alexander applied to the Board of Trustees for
		  permission for him to act, and General John Steele offered to resign as
		  Commissioner if necessary to secure him, saying, “My services may perhaps
		  be useful, his, I think, are essential.” The Trustees with some
		  reluctance for fear that the discipline of the University might suffer, granted
		  the request, with the proviso that in his opinion Professor Rhea could
		  efficiently act as temporary head of the institution. The reputation of
		  President Caldwell was much enhanced by his intelligent conduct of the
		  delimitation of this boundary. His work was satisfactory to the Commissioners
		  of the States interested, namely, John Steele, Montfort Stokes and Robert
		  Burton for North Carolina, and Joseph Blythe, Henry Middleton and John
		  Blasingame for South Carolina. Owing to the uncertainty in the description in
		  the act, the Commissioners recommended to the two States certain changes, which
		  the Legislatures adopted. Thomas Love, Montfort Stokes and John Patton for
		  North Carolina, and Joseph Blythe, John Blassengame (so spelt) and George W.
		  Earle for South Carolina, appointed to run the line by the new agreement, found
		  that impossible to be literally carried into effect, and reported a change,
		  which was adopted by both States in 1815. The line between North Carolina and
		  Georgia was confirmed in 1819.</p>
          <p>Graduates of 1807: Duncan Green Campbell, Orange County; Stephen
		  Davis, Warrenton; John Robert Donnell, New Bern; Gavin Hogg, Chapel Hill; John
		  Carr Montgomery, Hertford County; John Lewis Taylor, Chatham County.</p>
          <p>Donnell was the best scholar. He became a lawyer of large practice, a
		  Superior Court Judge and, marrying a daughter of Governor Richard Dobbs
		  Spaight, was one of the wealthiest men of the State. Gavin Hogg was a Tutor of
		  the University for a year, then settled in Bertie County as a lawyer, and had a
		  large practice and wide reputation. Subsequently he removed to Raleigh and was
		  appointed by the General Assembly, in conjunction with James Iredell and
		  William H. Battle, to prepare the Revised Statutes. He entered on the work with
		  zeal and ability, but was forced by ill health to resign and Frederick Nash was
		  substituted. By goodly income from his profession

		  possessor of a large fortune. Davis was a wealthy physician of Warrenton.
		  Montgomery and Taylor were likewise physicians. Campbell was a teacher, lawyer
		  and member of the Legislature of Georgia.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates four years before, Henry Chambers, of Rowan, was a
		  talented physician; William Green was a member of the Legislature from Warren;
		  James M. Henderson was a physician; Henry Young Webb, member of the
		  Legislature, Judge in Alabama Territory; John Henry Eaton, U. S. Senator,
		  Secretary of War, Covernor of Florida Territory, U. S. Minister to Spain,
		  author of “Life of Jackson,” husband of the beautiful and much
		  talked of “Peggy O'Neil.”</p>
          <p>The Graduates of 1808 were: John Bright Brown, Bladen County; Robert
		  Campbell, Campbell County, Va.; John Coleman, Halifax County, Va.; Wm. James
		  Cowan, Wilmington; Wm. Pugh Ferrand, Onslow County; Alfred Gatlin, New Bern;
		  John B. Giles, Salisbury; Wm. Green, Warren County; James Auld Harrington,
		  Richmond County; Wm. Henderson, Chapel Hill; Benjamin Dusenbury Rounsaville,
		  Lexington; Lewis Williams, Surry County; Thomas Lanier Williams, Surry
		  County.</p>
          <p>The best scholars were Lewis Williams and Thomas L. Williams, the
		  former speaking the Salutatory, the latter the Valedictory. The others honored
		  were Wm. Green, John B. Giles, Alfred Gatlin and John Coleman.</p>
          <p>Of this class, Wm. Henderson, of Chapel Hill, was Tutor for one year,
		  beginning in 1811. He was afterwards a physician, practicing in Williamston,
		  Martin County, until his death September 15, 1838. He was born in 1789, the
		  second son of Major Pleasant Henderson and his wife Sarah Martin.</p>
          <p>Lewis Williams was Tutor 1810-12. He was a native of Surry; served
		  1813 and 1814 as a representative in the State Legislature. In 1815 he was
		  elected a member of Congress and served continuously until his death February
		  12, 1842. He was most highly respected and was known as the Father of the
		  House; was a Trustee of the University from 1813 to his death. His brother,
		  Thomas Lanier Williams, was a Judge of the Supreme Court and also a Chancellor
		  of Tennessee.</p>
          <p>John B. Giles and Alfred Gatlin were both Representatives
		  <pb xml:id="p184" n="184"/>in Congress, while Giles was also a Trustee of the
		  University, a member of the General Assembly and of the Convention of 1835. Wm.
		  P. Ferrand, a physician, was a Commoner from Onslow; and James A. Harrington,
		  son of Gen. Henry Wm. Harrington, of the Revolution, was a member of the South
		  Carolina Legislature and a large planter; Benjamin D. Rounsaville, a lawyer.
		  John Coleman was a physician.</p>
          <p>There were some prominent matriculates not graduating with this class:
		  Daniel M. Forney, of Lincoln County, a Commoner; Ransom Hinton, a physician in
		  Wake; John D. Jones, Speaker of the House of Commons, a member of the
		  Convention of 1835, and a merchant and banker of Wilmington; John Neale, a
		  Commoner from Brunswick; John Owen, a Commoner from Bladen, Governor 1828-30
		  and President of the Harrisburg Convention which nominated Harrison. It is said
		  that he refused to run as Vice-President, and thus missed the Presidency. John
		  Neale, a member of the Legislature.</p>
          <p>Class of 1809: John Bobbitt, Franklin County; Maxwell Chambers,
		  Salisbury; Abner Wentworth Clopton, Virginia; John Gilchrist, Robeson County;
		  Philemon Hawkins, Warren County; William Hooper, Chapel Hill; John Briggs
		  Mebane, Chatham County; Thomas Gilchrist Polk, Mecklenburg County; John
		  Campbell Williams, Cumberland County.</p>
          <p>With this class Greek was studied in the Freshman year and the Iliad
		  in the Sophomore. The best scholar was William Hooper, the next Maxwell
		  Chambers, and then John B. Bobbitt and John C. Williams. The most eminent was
		  William Hooper who became a Baptist preacher, Professor of Languages and then
		  of Rhetoric in the University, Professor of Moral Philosophy in the South
		  Carolina College, President of Wake Forest College, and author of printed
		  addresses and sermons of rare excellence.</p>
          <p>Chambers became a physician in Salisbury of good reputation. He must
		  not be confounded with the merchant of New Orleans, a native of North Carolina,
		  of the same name, who bequeathed his property to Davidson College—only
		  part of which could be taken under its charter. Bobbitt was a classical teacher
		  all his life and was highly regarded as such in the counties

		  <pb xml:id="p185" n="185"/>of Nash and Franklin. Many of the
		  students prepared by him took a high stand at the University. Williams was a
		  member of the Legislature; Gilchrist, Polk and Mebane, likewise in the General
		  Assembly, and the last a Trustee of the University.</p>
          <p>Abner Wentworth Clopton, a native of Virginia, probably Chesterfield
		  County. He was a Tutor for one year beginning with 1809, when he sent in his
		  resignation, concluded in these naive words: “I find it utterly
		  inconvenient to receive no more than $250 a year. I am willing to serve
		  for $500 a year, and am richly worth it.” The Trustees agreed to
		  give him $400 on account of his special merits, but he was transferred
		  to the headship of the Grammar School, to have all tuition receipts and
		  $100 bonus. The tuition charges were $12 for the first and
		  $8 for the second term, but during the War of 1812 he was allowed in
		  addition $5 per annum. He was a very efficient teacher and the
		  reputation of his school was high under his administration. Besides being a
		  teacher, he was a physician and likewise a Baptist preacher. He was evidently a
		  shrewd trader. He induced Rev. Wm. Hooper to agree to give him $2,500
		  for his residence, the four acres now the Battle lot, then having indifferent
		  houses, a price generally thought to be $1,000 in excess. Hooper soon
		  repented of his bargain but Clopton held him to it with a hawk's grip. After
		  leaving Chapel Hill he settled in Virginia, near the residence of John
		  Randolph, of Roanoke, who highly appreciated him as a preacher.</p>
          <p>Among the members of the class who did not graduate, John F. Phifer
		  was a Commoner, Horace B. Satterwhite, a physician of Salisbury; Henry H.
		  Watters, an influential planter of Brunswick County; Bartlett Yancey, one of
		  the most eminent men of the State in his day, Speaker of the State Senate,
		  Representative in Congress, an active Trustee of the University, and a Promoter
		  of Public School Education; Wm. S. Blackman, a Commoner from Sampson;
		  Abridgeton S. H. Burgess, a physician in Virginia.</p>
          <p>Graduates of 1810: Thomas Williamson Jones, Lawrenceville. Va.; James
		  Fauntleroy Taylor, Chatham County; John Witherspoon, New Bern.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p186" n="186"/>
          <p>Jones was a physician; Taylor, Attorney-General and Trustee of the
		  University; Witherspoon, Presbyterian divine at Hillsboro and elsewhere,
		  President of Miami College, Doctor of Divinity from his Alma Mater and of Laws
		  from Princeton. Mark Alexander, of Virginia, was with this class in the Senior
		  year. He became a member of Congress and member of the Virginia Convention of
		  1829-'30.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduating matriculates Samuel P. Ashe, of Halifax, and
		  Thomas J. Singleton, of Craven County, were members of the Legislature.</p>
          <p>The honorary degrees were as follows: Doctor of Divinity to Rev. David
		  Caldwell, eminent teacher and member of the Constitutional Convention of 1788;
		  Rev. James Hall, the preacher-captain in the Revolution, Classical Teacher,
		  Principal of Clio's Nursery; James McRee, pastor of Centre church, Mecklenburg
		  County.</p>
          <p>Master of Arts to the following: Rev. Samuel Craighead Caldwell,
		  pastor and teacher in Mecklenburg County; Rev. John Robinson, pastor of Poplar
		  Tent church; Rev. William Leftwich Turner; Rev. James Wallis, Principal of
		  Providence Academy in Mecklenburg; Rev. John McKamie Wilson, pastor at Rocky
		  River and Principal of a Classical School.</p>
          <p>Commencement was ordered to be on the 24th of May, in 1812, on the
		  first Thursday in June, with a six weeks' vacation thereafter, and another four
		  weeks' vacation beginning on the second Thursday in December. In the next year
		  the last Thursday in June was substituted for the first.</p>
          <p>The evil effects of the secession of 1805 and subsequent troubles were
		  especially evident at the Commencement of 1811, there being no graduates,
		  although the honorary degree of A.B. was awarded to John Ambrose Ramsey, a
		  former student of high rank, who afterwards represented Moore County in the
		  General Assembly. Nor were there any matriculates of note with the class.</p>
          <p>In order to show the stately dignity of the old times I give a copy of
		  a Doctor of Divinity Diploma (D.D.) granted by the University in 1810 to the
		  eminent classical teacher, David Caldwell. It is noticeable that the Latin of
		  “Chapel Hill” is “<foreign xml:lang="lat">Sacrarii-Mons</foreign>,” <pb xml:id="p187" n="187"/>or Mount of
		  the Chapel. Those who worshipped in Buffalo church probably did not know it by
		  the name of Bubulus, which some authorities say designated a kind of antelope.
		  Alamance is correctly spelt Allemance, a name brought over from Germany by the
		  settlers from that country. It savors of pathos to find a document so
		  formidable signed by a President, one Professor and two Tutors, being the only
		  Socii, i. e., Faculty, in charge of the University.</p>

          <p>As emphasizing the unfortunate interference by the Trustees in the
		  discipline of the institution, I give the substance of a letter by the
		  Secretary, Adjutant-General Robert Williams, to Dr. Caldwell in 1810,
		  communicating officially a resolution of the Board, recommending the
		  re-admission of a dismissed student. The Secretary, himself a Trustee,
		  expressed the hope that the Faculty will not heed it. “If you will make
		  the stand, Sir, it will in preference to all other methods have a tendency to
		  bring the Board to a proper sense of their duties. They cannot dispense with
		  your services—for you have more friends on <pb xml:id="p188" n="188"/>the
		  Board than any other man whatever.” * * * “Mr. Alves and myself
		  made talks against the report but it was carried by one majority.” This
		  action of the Board is curious as giving a good reason for its rejection, yet
		  favoring its adoption. “In their opinion Mr. Long did justly and
		  completely forfeit his rights as a student * * * through his disorderly
		  behavior, rudeness and disobedience. * * * They find a difficulty in
		  recommending that course which in consideration of the parents of the young man
		  would be most consonant with their feelings.” The regard for the feelings
		  of the parents weighed down the good of the University. Dr. Caldwell endorsed
		  on the letter of General Williams, “A new specimen of enforcement of
		  authority.”</p>
          <p>President Caldwell responded with hardly suppressed indignation in a
		  letter addressed to the Board. “If this College is to be maintained the
		  establishment must somehow be altered.” He offered his resignation of the
		  Presidency, hoping that it would be accepted at an early a date as possible,
		  and at the end of six months absolutely. He was willing to remain in a
		  subordinate capacity on a salary of $800 a year, so that $700 and
		  the President's house might go towards the salary of the new executive.</p>
          <p>General Williams was right; the Trustees could not manage without
		  Caldwell. He was induced by implied, if not expressed, promises of a change of
		  policy, to retain his Presidency.</p>
          <p>In 1811 occurred an outbreak, the facts of which are not recorded. It
		  is mentioned in a letter by a Trustee, Dr. Calvin Jones, then living in
		  Raleigh, to Dr. Caldwell. Dr. Jones says that both inhabitants and strangers
		  think that there never was a more clearly marked case to justify the most
		  vigorous exercise of authority. The students met with reproof from everybody,
		  whether gentle or simple. Their crestfeathers were completely down. Dr. Jones
		  was greatly surprised at the effort of Governor Stone to get two of them into
		  the Raleigh Academy; while he was not surprised that Mr. Sherwood Haywood, a
		  “good, polite, clever, worthy man, who never contradicted anyone in his
		  life,” should have seconded his efforts. From this we see that the
		  authorities of the University objected to their <pb xml:id="p189" n="189"/>
		  dismissed students being received into preparatory schools, as well as
		  colleges.</p>
          <p>The insubordination, whatever it was, caused all the members of the
		  Senior class, except John A. Ramsay, to forfeit their diplomas. The others were
		  Mark Alexander, Thomas J. Faddis, Wm. Gilchrist, Frank Hawkins, Wm. J. Polk and
		  William Moore, who passed their November examinations. They were all good men.
		  Moore was the best scholar in the class; Gilchrist was next, afterwards a
		  member of the Tennessee Legislature. Faddis, Hawkins and Polk were physicians
		  of good standing, the latter of high reputation in Columbia, Tennessee. They
		  obtained their diplomas in 1813; the others did not return.</p>
          <p>The Graduates of 1812 were: Daniel Graham, Anson County; James Hogg,
		  late of Chapel Hill; Thomas Clark Hooper, Chapel Hill; William Johnston,
		  Franklin County; Murdock McLean, Robeson County; Archibald McQueen, Robeson
		  County; Johnson Pinkston, Chowan County; Joseph Blount Gregory Roulhac, Bertie
		  County; William Edwards Webb, Granville County; Charles Jewkes Wright,
		  Wilmington.</p>
          <p>Of these Graham was Secretary of the State of Tennessee, of great
		  service to his Alma Mater in securing her military warrants; Hogg, McLean and
		  Pinkston, physicians; Hooper, a lawyer; McQueen, a minister; Roulhac,
		  son-in-law of Chief Justice Ruffin, a highly esteemed merchant of Raleigh;
		  Webb, Professor of Ancient Languages in the University in 1799, as has been
		  narrated.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, Richard T. Brownrigg, of Chowan, was a planter
		  and owner of fisheries, also a member of the Legislature. He removed to
		  Columbia, Mississippi. David Dancy was a physician of standing, whose life was
		  accidentally cut short.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) was conferred on Rev.
		  Ashbel Green, D.D., President of the college of New Jersey (Princeton); of
		  Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) on Rev. James Patriot Wilson, a clergyman of
		  Philadelphia, author of works on religious subjects; and on Rev. George Addison
		  Baxter, afterwards President of Washington and of Hampden-Sidney Colleges, and
		  Professor of Theology in Union Theological Seminary, also an author.</p>

          <p>From time to time the By-Laws or, as they were called, Ordinances were
		  revised and much enlarged. I give some of the changes, deemed of interest. The
		  Faculty consisted of the President, Professors and Tutors, the President having
		  two votes in case of a tie.</p>
          <p>They must not be members of either of the societies or even attend a
		  meeting.</p>
          <p>Each was bound to enforce the laws and report all breaches.</p>
          <p>They must hold monthly meetings and a report of their proceedings must
		  be submitted to the Trustees. A history of each student must be kept.</p>
          <p>The winter session must begin on the 1st of January, if there one
		  student to form a class, if not as soon as there shall be.</p>
          <p>Examinations for admission were in the presence of all the
		  Faculty.</p>
          <p>Tuition and board at Steward's Hall were payable in advance. If the
		  student arrived at the middle of the session or afterwards, he paid
		  one-half.</p>
          <p>Each student must buy a copy of the laws for 12 1-2 cents. The
		  certificate of membership was endorsed on the copy; and each must pledge his
		  truth and honor to obey the laws.</p>
          <p>The Faculty were authorized to dismiss a student for general
		  worthlessness, without specifying a particular offence.</p>
          <p>Even when not in study hours students must observe “proper
		  silence and respectful deportment.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p191" n="191"/>
          <p>Two or three declaimed before the Faculty each afternoon. There were
		  no exemptions except for natural impediment.</p>
          <p>On Saturday forenoons all students recited Grammar, or passages in
		  Latin or Greek, or read pieces of their own composition.</p>
          <p>The annual examinations, (Commencements), began on the 22d of June, or
		  on the 23d if that day was Sunday.</p>
          <p>If one was absent he was examined before all the Faculty.</p>
          <p>Habitual indolence, or absences, was punishable according to the
		  aggravation.</p>
          <p>Deficient students were either publicly mentioned as bad scholars, or
		  admonished privately, or “de-classed.”</p>
          <p>The Faculty assigned duties at Commencement. Refusal to perform them
		  was punishable by loss of diplomas.</p>
          <p>Instruction in morals and religion was required.</p>
          <p>Insults to the people of the village and attacks on property were
		  forbidden, and the village could not be visited in study hours without
		  permission. Students were prohibited to “make horse races” or bets;
		  to keep cocks or fowls of any kind or for any purpose; to keep dogs or
		  firearms, and to use firearms without permission.</p>
          <p>For intoxication the punishment was for the first offence admonition
		  before the Faculty; for a repetition public admonition or suspension.</p>
          <p>For refusal to inform on a fellow-student the offender was admonished
		  or suspended. For combination against a law, or to offer disrespect to the
		  Faculty, all offenders, or leaders only, could be punished.</p>
          <p>On Sundays all ordinary diversion and exercises must be laid aside.
		  Students could not fish, or hunt, or “walk far abroad,” but what
		  distance should be called “far” was not defined. Manual or corporal
		  labor could not be without permission.</p>
          <p>Adjectives were exhausted in the denunciation of swearing;
		  “Profane, blasphemous, impious language” prohibited. Admonition
		  awaited all caught lying or using indecent gesture or language. If the
		  falsehood was direct and malicious the punishment was suspension or
		  expulsion.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p192" n="192"/>
          <p>If a student should refuse or delay opening his door when ordered by a
		  member of the Faculty, it could be forced at his expense, and the occupant
		  required to pay damages and be otherwise punished if found breaking any other
		  law. And so, if a student should be sent for and refuse to appear, it was
		  “a high contempt of authority.”</p>
          <p>Rooms must be kept clean, students must not introduce filth of any
		  kind therein, nor throw on the walls, nor within twenty yards of the building,
		  any filth or dirt under penalty of being censured and forced to remove the
		  same.</p>
          <p>Students were required to appear neat and cleanly, or be admonished,
		  but they were recommended to be plain in dress. After January 1, 1805, they, as
		  well as the Faculty, were ordered to have black gowns and wear the same in
		  Person Hall at public meetings, but students must not wear a hat in the
		  buildings.</p>
          <p>No student should build a hut, or retain one already built, without
		  permission. This refers to the practice of those seeking privacy, having rough
		  shelters in the corners of the partly finished South or “Main”
		  Building, or under some umbrageous tree.</p>
          <p>Nor could students go out of sight of the buildings, or hearing of the
		  bell in study hours, or at any other time when the bell might call them to
		  duty.</p>
          <p>Rooms were not retained for anyone absent at the beginning of the
		  session. At one period the students were allowed to race for them, as soon as
		  prayer was finished, on the first morning.</p>
          <p>If the Faculty deemed any house improper for boarders, on account of
		  irregular manner of living, or disorderly or pernicious examples, they may
		  report it to the Trustees.</p>
          <p>As a rule there could be no rooming out of the University building
		  until there were four in each room, but exceptions could be made if necessary
		  for health, a certificate of a physician being the only evidence of this
		  necessity.</p>
          <p>At the first ringing of the bell in the morning all should rise. At
		  the second all should go to the Chapel.</p>
          <p>Students were forbidden to eat or drink at a tavern without
		  permission. By “tavern” is meant places where alcoholic liquors
		  were sold for drinks.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p193" n="193"/>
          <p>Dismission or expulsion was the punishment for associating with an
		  expelled student. All universities and colleges were to be notified of the fact
		  of expulsion and requested not to receive the offender.</p>
          <p>Those suspended must not reside within two miles of Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The Presiding Professor must notify parents of proper expenses and
		  request them not to furnish their sons with additional funds.</p>
          <p>The Faculty shall have power to forbid dangerous games, and it was
		  solemnly provided that no ball or other substitute used in licensed plays and
		  pastimes should be composed of harder material than wound yarn covered with
		  leather. This probably was intended for base-ball, in which it was the practice
		  to put out a player by hitting him with a thrown ball while off base.</p>
          <p>For settlements of controversies between Faculty and students and
		  officers of the institution, individually and collectively, six Trustees were
		  annually appointed, who, with the President, made a quasi-court, any three of
		  whom were a quorum. Their decision stood until reversed by the Board of
		  Trustees.</p>

          <head>STEWARDS.</head>
          <p>After the resignation of John Taylor, usually known as Buck Taylor,
		  Pleasant Henderson, a Major of Cavalry under Col. Malready in the Revolutionary
		  War, the youngest son of Samuel and Elizabeth (Williams) Henderson, brother of
		  Judge Richard, who was father of Archibald and Chief Justice Henderson, was for
		  some years the Steward of the University. Besides this position, he was during
		  the sessions of the General Assembly Reading Clerk of the House of Commons. He
		  married Sarah, daughter of Col. James Martin, brother of Governor Alexander
		  Martin. The late Hamilton C. Jones, Reporter of the Supreme Court, married his
		  daughter. He removed to Tennessee in 1831.</p>
          <p>The next Steward was Samuel Love, who came to Chapel Hill from
		  Virginia. His son, Wm. Caldwell Love, was a student in 1802, but did not
		  graduate, settled in Salisbury as a <pb xml:id="p194" n="194"/>lawyer, served one
		  term in Congress, and was one of our Trustees from 1814 to 1818.</p>
          <p>Mr. Love was succeeded by Wm. Barbee, son of Christopher Barbee, one
		  of the donors of the University site. He lived for some time in Chapel Hill and
		  then succeeded to part of his father's land, his home being on a conspicuous
		  hill called “the Mountain,” about two and a half miles east from
		  Piney Prospect. As the village became more populous boarding at Commons became
		  less favored, especially among the wealthier students. The compulsory feature
		  was relaxed and finally abolished. Mr. Barbee was a member of the House of
		  Commons in 1819.</p>
          <p>In 1810 it was concluded to create a new office with a salary of
		  $20 a year, called Superintendency of Buildings and Lands. The first
		  Superintendent was John Taylor, the elder, usually called Buck Taylor. He soon
		  gave place to Wm. Barbee, the Steward, who held both offices for several
		  years.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>BEHAVIOR OF OLD-TIME STUDENTS.</head>
          <p>The records show that some of the students were abundantly wild in the
		  early sessions of the University. In addition to the riots of 1798-99 the
		  Faculty records, though incomplete, show that drinking and fights and rowdyism
		  were too frequent. A distinguished statesman, Thomas Hart Benton, figured in a
		  dangerous fray, drawing a pistol on Archibald Lytle, of Tennessee, the
		  difficulty occasioned by Benton's having struck his adversary's nephew, a lad
		  in the Grammar School. Lytle excused himself for not engaging in a duel with
		  Benton by the plea that he had come a long distance at great expense for an
		  education and could not afford to be expelled. We have such entries as these:
		  “H. M. expelled for gross insolence in the Preparatory School. T. N.
		  suspended for six months and recommended for expulsion for cutting C. I. over
		  the eye with a stick.” The Trustees declined to expel him. As to the
		  charge of theft brought against one who afterwards became famous in the
		  councils of the nation, I conclude that it arose from a mistake, distorted by
		  the fierce party spirit of the day.</p>
          <p>A member of the Grammar School, “M. J., severely whipped for
		  stabbing O. J. with a pen-knife in the shoulders.” “W. R.
		  <pb xml:id="p195" n="195"/>suspended for kindling a fire in the house of the
		  Trustees with intent to burn it.” “J. G. was suspended for stealing
		  beehives.” Mr. Caldwell reports to the Trustees: “It is no uncommon
		  thing for the students to go out at night at a very late hour and take
		  bee-hives from the inhabitants of the village and the country round. They have
		  found safety in the caution they practice.”</p>
          <p>Other entries are: “W. K. admonished before all the students for
		  exploding powder and refusing to go into recitation when ordered.”
		  “R. A. carried a keg of whiskey into his room, and he, A. J. and R. C.
		  had a spree. He also associated with two suspended persons. R. A. was sentenced
		  (offence not given) to sign a confession and read it before the students
		  assembled for prayers. H. N. was expelled by the Trustees for gross insolence
		  in the Preparatory School.”</p>
          <p>At a somewhat later period H. B. was expelled for insolence to the
		  President while suppressing a disturbance, firing pistols in the buildings and
		  breaking a window-glass over the head of Tutor Clopton while holding
		  recitation. I do not think that the glass came into actual contact with the
		  Tutor's cranium.</p>
          <p>R. S. was expelled for firing pistols and for throwing stones at the
		  Faculty. C. W. had the milder punishment of suspension for the rest of the
		  session, as he only tried to break open a Tutor's door, and helped carry off a
		  carriage and a gate.</p>
          <p>J. R. received a forced vacation of six months for firing a pistol in
		  college and helping block up the Chapel door, while J. A. and R. B. got four
		  months for firing pistols only. Public admonition before Trustees, Faculty and
		  students was meted to J. W. for carrying off a carriage and gate and beam of
		  the bell, J. P. for rolling stones in the passage of the building, J. L. for
		  abstracting the irons of the bell, R. L., S. K. and J. M. for carrying off a
		  carriage, and N. B. for threats of violence to Mr. Johnston, the teacher of the
		  Academy.</p>
          <p>A brawl, which created great excitement, occurred during the
		  Commencement of 1804 between Henry Chambers and a son of General Davie, Hyder
		  Ali, humorously described by Dr. Hooper. The annual ball was held in the
		  dining-room of Steward's Hall. The non-dancers stood around witnessing the
		  <pb xml:id="p196" n="196"/>amusement, and among those in front stood Chambers.
		  While dancing Davie trod twice on the toes of Chambers, who demanded an
		  explanation in such threatening manner as to incense the offender. Whereupon,
		  though there was disclaimer of intention to insult, a fight ensued in the yard
		  of the dwelling, Davie using a knife on account, he alleged, of the disparity
		  in size between himself and antagonist, who was wounded, but not dangerously.
		  The Trustees, being in session, tried the case, and on each signing a written
		  declaration of regret and admission of being in fault, graciously pardoned the
		  combatants. Davie expressed himself as especially grieved because he had used a
		  weapon when his adversary was unarmed.</p>
          <p>T. J. fired a pistol in college but afterwards helped to put down
		  disorder; C. D. C. “<choice><sic>mischeviously</sic><corr>mischieviously</corr></choice>
		  trimmed” a horse in Mr. Taylor's enclosure, but satisfied the owner. The
		  sentences were as follows The pistol-firer and horse-trimmer were admonished
		  before the Faculty and students; the carriage-taker and Chapel-blocker above
		  mentioned, were admonished before the Board of Trustees.</p>
          <p>I give these instances in order to show the character of the pranks
		  thought to be “smart” and funny. There were many students who
		  attended to their duties faithfully and obeyed the rules. For example the idea
		  of Vice-President King or Governor Branch sallying out at midnight and stealing
		  bee-hives is inconceivable. There were many like them.</p>
          <p>The difficulties of government were greatly increased by the existence
		  in the village of one of those fruitful sources of evil, a grog-shop, then
		  called tavern. An Ordinance was adopted prohibiting the students visiting it,
		  but of course it was <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">brutum
		  fulmen</foreign>.</hi>Public opinion by no means condemned drinking ardent
		  spirits, and for many years, if the drinking by students did not amount to
		  excess, it was not regarded as a serious offence. The University law was
		  directed mainly against intoxication. To preserve order and detect offenders,
		  the Tutors were charged with the combined duties of detectives and constables.
		  They must with eager ears listen for sounds of revelry or even innocent jollity
		  and forthwith disperse the assembly, and report its members for punishment.
		  Besides this some Professor was ordered to visit the rooms each morning. Of
		  course, in addition <pb xml:id="p197" n="197"/>to constant collision with
		  high-spirited young men, such supervision had the tendency to impair their
		  self-respect, and to make them regard the Faculty as their natural enemies.</p>
          <p>In addition to the foregoing I find in Caldwell's handwriting a
		  memorandum of what he called “notable transactions,” in 1802:</p>
          <p>On the 28th of May a calf was placed in the Chapel and the benches
		  pushed up against the pulpit. On the 5th of June a fence was built around the
		  door of one Nutting and across the road. Captain Caldwell's house was stoned.
		  Before these offences were committed the house of the Steward, Major Henderson,
		  was stoned, one of his buildings overturned, his gate taken from its hinges and
		  placed upon the pulpit.</p>
          <p>On Sunday night the 27th of June a bee-hive was stolen from John
		  Taylor, carried to the Preparatory School-house, the honey taken out and daubed
		  over the floor. The hive was left in the woods.</p>
          <p>Saturday night, 14th of August, Yeargin's corn was cut. A great number
		  of toad-frogs and terrapins thrown into Monsieur Molie's room. He was also
		  insulted with the utmost license in the dining-room and elsewhere; “nor
		  was decency or order anywhere observed.” In the dining-room stamping and
		  outrageous insults; outside hollowing and extreme disorder.</p>
          <p>Wednesday night, 25th of August, Molie's room was burst open and a
		  bee-hive placed in it. His bed was filled with a vast quantity of hair. The
		  intention was professed to drive him from the University. President Caldwell
		  adds the astounding information that this method of getting rid of officers by
		  unremitting insult, abuse and violence has grown up with the institution. It
		  was to put a stop to outrages like the foregoing that the ill-starred monitor
		  experiment, hereafter to be described, was made.</p>
          <p>President Caldwell frequently bewailed the committal of secret
		  offences, and the impossibility of procuring evidence against the offenders.
		  The students on the other hand evidently resented his acquiring information in
		  any manner not known to them. On one occasion, in 1810, pistols were fired in
		  the building, and stones thrown at the windows of a recitation room
		  <pb xml:id="p198" n="198"/>while the Professor and his class were at their duties.
		  Some of the offenders were suspended and others reprimanded. Forty-six
		  students, a majority, including many good, orderly men, presented a paper
		  stating that they were “bound by every sentiment of honor and justice to
		  request the names of those who had given secret information to the
		  Faculty.” They charged that injustice had been done to some of those
		  disciplined and urged the “impropriety of such information being received
		  as evidence.” “Falsehoods will be invented and we will be convicted
		  without knowing our accusers, or having an opportunity of acquitting ourselves
		  of the charges against us.” * * * “We anxiously hope that by
		  granting our petition you will put it out of the power of envious and malicious
		  informers privately injuring the innocent.” The journals of the Faculty
		  are so imperfect that it is not known how this attack on the fair dealing of
		  the Faculty was received, but it is certain that the name of the informer was
		  not given up.</p>
          <p>In the spring of 1803, for some cause not now apparent, bitter
		  quarrels occurred among some of the students, convulsing the student body and
		  threatening to result in four or five duels. Challenges were given and
		  accepted. There was one meeting, as the journal states that Samuel G. Hopkins,
		  of Kentucky, and John H. Hawkins, of North Carolina, were expelled; the one for
		  being in a duel and the other for acting as second, but further particulars are
		  not given. Three or four other conflicts seemed imminent. Unable to cope with
		  the difficulty Caldwell called in the help of the Trustees. The President of
		  the Board, a Continental officer of the Revolution, who fought all the way from
		  Brandywine to Eutaw, Col. Wm. Polk, famous for his chivalric courage and high
		  sense of honor, responded with a letter to the students at large, blazing with
		  earnest depreciation of their conduct. He is shocked by the report of the
		  disgraceful and disorderly state of the University. I give a few sentences of
		  his vigorous letter: “That students, almost grown, should at this late
		  and inauspicious day, be guilty of the deplorable madness and folly of rashly
		  sacrificing their character and fame, and laying in dust and ashes the fairest
		  prospects of their country, through the destruction of her best anchor and
		  hope, her University, is too much. It is folly in its most gigantic
		  <pb xml:id="p199" n="199"/>and hideous shape; insanity replete with consequences
		  too direful and deleterious to be tolerated. In fine a deed of the kind
		  meditated would operate as the worst of treason against the State.” But
		  for the arrival of three students, Searcy, James Benton and Nunn, who gave the
		  information that the dangers were passed, he would have collected some Trustees
		  and with them visited the University “with the fixed determination to
		  expel with the most marked ignominy and disgrace any student guilty of giving,
		  bearing or accepting a challenge.” If the thing was not ended he urged
		  Caldwell to send expresses for General Davie, Walter Alves, Richard Bennehan
		  and Duncan Cameron, and notify him.</p>
          <p>Col. Polk was a stern, determined, strong man, physically and
		  mentally, ready to fight any man on provocation, of commanding influence by
		  reason of his war record, unyielding will, a mind, not great but strong,
		  vigorous and well-balanced, and extensive possessions in North Carolina and
		  Tennessee. The would-be duelists probably expected his approbation. His letter,
		  therefore, couched in such threatening language, effectually and promptly
		  crushed the tendency to deadly conflicts—as it has turned out, forever.
		  As showing the evil sentiments on this subject once prevailing, I state that
		  two students of the College of South Carolina who had been friends, promising
		  young men, fought a duel with pistols for slight cause, one being killed and
		  the other so wounded that his life was blighted; and the second of one of them
		  was a prominent lawyer, afterwards United States Senator Butler.</p>
          <p>At this University there was no one killed or wounded. The two
		  students who had been expelled, on the motion by the bye of General Davie,
		  applied to have the sentence remitted, but a committee of which ex-Governor
		  Martin was chairman reported against it and the application was refused. The
		  Board adopted a most stringent ordinance, commanding the Faculty to expel and
		  then hand over to the civil authorities all engaged in such conflicts as
		  principals or as aiders and abetters.</p>
          <p>By the kindness of General Rufus Barringer, we have a letter dated
		  February 28, 1804, by a sprightly student, Henry Chambers, to Adlai Osborne, of
		  Salisbury, a recent graduate, which describes a 22d February celebration at the
		  University. There <pb xml:id="p200" n="200"/>was prevailing what the physicians
		  called “nervous fever.” One student, Philips of Edgecombe, uncle of
		  ex-Judge Fred Philips, had died from it, and his countryman, Lemuel Sessoms,
		  was not expected to live. He goes on, “My dear fellow, amidst all our
		  afflictions of sickness, etc., we did not forget the 22d of February; nay we
		  cherished a lively recollection of the character to whom that day gave birth
		  and celebrated it in a pleasing and splendid manner. Yes; on that day we not
		  only gave to the world the strongest, most conclusive indications of our love
		  for the exalted, the immortal Washington, but showed incontestibly that we were
		  hopeful votaries of Bacchus. About thirty of the most respectable students
		  subscribed for a supper to be furnished by Mr. Nunn. The recent death of Mr.
		  Philips prevented our having a dance as was intended, after the Senior class
		  had finished speaking. Will you believe it—that out of that number there
		  were but four or five sober. I, though strange to tell, was one of this number;
		  but it was almost impossible for me to have been otherwise than sober as I was
		  chosen President, and it was indispensable that I should keep cool. All the
		  Faculty attended by special invitation. They gave us some good toasts, drank
		  pretty freely, retired (except ——, whom we consider one of
		  ourselves), early and left us to our own enjoyment. —— performed
		  noble feats that day. He got intoxicated twice. He, some others and myself,
		  commenced drinking wine at 11 o'clock in the forenoon and continued drinking
		  until one. By this time all found it necessary to go to bed to get sober enough
		  to attend the supper. This we did, and —— got ‘all seas
		  over’ again. College exhibited a pretty scene next morning. I am unable
		  to describe it.”</p>
          <p>It is impossible to imagine such a debauch in our day. Chambers was in
		  the Senior class, a man of talent, afterwards a leader in the anti-monitor
		  dispute with the Trustees. He was a physician of strength.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>A DISASTROUS EXPERIMENT IN COLLEGE GOVERNMENT.—THE <lb/>GREAT
		  REBELLION.</head>
          <p>The indignation aroused by such offences, especially the dueling
		  episode, prompted the Trustees in 1805 to adopt laws of such inquisitorial
		  severity as outraged the sense of justice among <pb xml:id="p201" n="201"/>the
		  students. In the first place the President and Faculty were required to take an
		  oath before a Justice of the Peace or Judge to execute the laws of the
		  institution. Having thus quickened the sense of responsibility of the governors
		  the next move was on the students. There was already, (as I have heretofore
		  shown), a by-law of the institution that the President should appoint a monitor
		  for each class “to mark absentees from Prayers and Public Worship on
		  Sunday, to note all profane swearing or gross or vulgar language, and report at
		  Prayers on each Sunday morning.”</p>
          <p>They were notified that if they failed they would “betray the
		  trust confided to them.” Naturally this duty was neglected, as the
		  monitors were not willing to incur the odium of being “common
		  informers.” It was determined by the Trustees to strengthen this
		  ordinance. Mr. A. D. Murphey, the young lawyer who had recently been Professor
		  of Ancient Languages, moved for a committee to report amendments to the
		  by-laws. Mr. Duncan Cameron, who then at the age of 28 was a lawyer of large
		  practice, afterwards also a Judge and President of the great State Bank of
		  North Carolina, with Murphey as chairman, constituted the committee. Their
		  report was unanimously adopted, but there was only a bare quorum of the
		  Board.</p>
          <p>The ordinance required two monitors to be appointed by lot from the
		  twelve senior students of each class to serve one month. They were to take an
		  oath before some officer authorized to administer an oath as follows:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“I, A. B., Monitor of the .......... class, on the establishment
		  of the University of North Carolina, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully
		  execute the duties of a monitor of the .......... class, during my continuance
		  in office, without fear, favor or affection, to the best of my understanding,
		  so help me, God.”</p>
            <p>1. The duties were to preserve order among the students in the
		  College, the dining-room and elsewhere, with power to suppress every species of
		  irregularity. Opposition by a student to a monitor engaged in preserving the
		  good order of the institution, was a misdemeanor, to be punished by private or
		  public admonition, by suspension, or otherwise, as the offence might
		  deserve.</p>
            <p>2. The classes were to sit together in the dining-room, the monitors
		  presiding. They were invested with full power, and it was their duty to
		  preserve proper decency and decorum among the students at their respective
		  tables, to permit no loud talking, laughing or other improper behavior,
		  <pb xml:id="p202" n="202"/>to suffer no waste of the provisions, nor suffer the
		  same to be abused at the table, nor allow any to be taken away, without the
		  Steward's consent. In case of misbehavior they were directed to order the
		  offender away from the table. All students were bound to take their meals at
		  Commons unless excused on the plea of ill health.</p>
            <p>3. They were strictly to watch over the conduct of the students at all
		  times during their continuance in office, and make report of every irregularity
		  and impropriety of behavior to the Faculty at the end of each week. They were
		  also to report all injuries to public buildings and property with the names of
		  the offenders.</p>
            <p>4. At the ringing of the bell for meals the students were ordered to
		  repair to the dining-room, arrange themselves according to the order of their
		  classes on each side of the door, with their Monitors at the head, and thus
		  follow the Tutor into the room.</p>
            <p>5. Each class must sit by itself in the Public Hall with the Monitors
		  at their head. The Tutors and Monitors were enjoined to have these formalities
		  strictly complied with, “and in no instance permit the same to be
		  departed from.”</p>
            <p>6. The Monitors of the Junior and Sophomore classes were to be the
		  marshals at Commencement and make all necessary arrangements therefor.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Those present when this astounding law was passed were the President
		  of the Board, Col. Wm. Polk, Duncan Cameron, A. D. Murphey, Col. Edward Jones,
		  Robert Montgomery, Adlai Osborne and Wm. H. Hill.</p>
          <p>They were among the best men of the State. Cameron and Murphey were
		  among the leaders in professional life and in legislative halls. Public school
		  teachers owe Murphey a peculiar debt of gratitude. Jones was the able
		  Solicitor-General. Montgomery and Hill were members of Congress. Osborne was a
		  lawyer of large practice, as indeed were all the others except Col. Polk, who
		  was president of a bank and a wealthy planter. Not one, except Murphey, had
		  been a teacher.</p>
          <p>Murphey must be held principally responsible for this ill-judged
		  measure. Public opinion deemed it the suggestion of President Caldwell, but he
		  denied it and appealed to the Board of Trustees to confirm his statement. The
		  ordinance was written by a lawyer evidently. I can only account for the
		  monstrous blunder on the part of men of such reputation for sagacity by the
		  following explanation. President Caldwell said that in the great rebellion of
		  1799, when Gillaspie, the Principal, was beaten, he and Murphey were
		  threatened. It may be that resentment <pb xml:id="p203" n="203"/>for such outrages
		  unsettled his judgment, and Cameron, a busy lawyer acquiesced because his
		  friend, having lived among the students, was supposed to have peculiar
		  knowledge of the subject. So clear to Murphey seemed the propriety of governing
		  the institution by the machinery of the criminal law, just as are governed in
		  large measure the German universities, that he proposed to the Trustees to ask
		  the General Assembly to make the head of the University a Justice of the Peace.
		  This motion met with slender support. It is justice to him to state that he
		  soon changed his notions about the discipline of students.</p>
          <p>As the spirit of the proposed ordinance was the treatment of the
		  students like soldiers in service, it was naturally approved by Col. Polk, who
		  had been President of the Board for two years. He was a man of autocratic
		  temper, and had served under the iron discipline of Baron Von Steuben of the
		  school of the great Frederick.</p>
          <p>If our students had been a colony of wax-dolls they might have
		  submitted to this law without a murmur. If cruel tyranny had crushed out all
		  their instinctive sense of right and wrong and made them a colony of liars and
		  sneaks, they would have cringed, promised obedience and straightway
		  systematically fawned upon and deceived the professors; but, being American
		  boys with independence of thought and abundance of pluck, they received the
		  ordinance with angry disgust and determination not to submit. Four Seniors out
		  of seven, eleven Juniors out of sixteen, twenty-four Sophomores and six
		  Freshmen, in all forty-five, being a majority of all the students in
		  attendance, and a very large majority of the ablest and most mature, presented
		  a remonstrance to the Faculty and Trustees, at the same time binding themselves
		  to leave the institution if one of their number should be punished. And to use
		  their own language, “If any signer should withdraw from the league he
		  should be considered unworthy the attention of a gentleman,” an ostracism
		  more terrible to the average student than death or expulsion.</p>
          <p>President Caldwell had not then learned the management of North
		  Carolina students. He made the singular mistake of <pb xml:id="p204" n="204"/>
		  supposing that the requirement of an oath was the only cause of the
		  indignation. At his request a “pledge of honor” was substituted for
		  the oath, but the promise in other respects being more stringent. The change
		  was unanimously rejected by the recalcitrants. After this, in December, 1805,
		  the ordinance was unanimously repealed.</p>
          <p>As this was a disastrous experiment in college government, I give in
		  detail the substance of the ordinance substituted for that requiring the oath,
		  adopted about six weeks later at a called meeting of the Board.</p>
          <p>The Trustees sought to sustain their authority by “suspending
		  for unlimited time” the obnoxious requirement.</p>
          <p>By the amendment the Monitors were required to repeat and subscribe,
		  in presence of the Faculty and students, the following promise, to be engrossed
		  in large characters in a book, to be kept for that purpose: “I, A. B.,
		  Monitor of the....class, do promise and pledge myself......that I will endeavor
		  by a faithful and impartial discharge of the duties of my appointment to prove
		  my respect and veneration for a moral and religious conduct, my patriotism and
		  love of honor, my attachment to the interests of literature and science, and my
		  filial regard for the reputation and happiness of this University.” These
		  fine words by no means buttered the parsnips of the students, for there
		  followed additional duties and requirements even more exacting and odious than
		  were in the previous ordinance.</p>
          <p>The first gave power to the Monitors only over their own classes. The
		  second charged them with the duty of watching the conduct and language of all
		  students, as well as of their own classes. They must forbid immoral and
		  irreligious conduct and breaches of the laws; and not only those but every
		  species of irregularity and indecency, words so general as necessarily to lead
		  to frequent disputes. Like the Tribunes of Rome their persons were made in a
		  manner <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">sacrosancti</foreign>,</hi>it
		  being a misdemeanor to disobey or insult one. The same strict table laws were
		  re-enacted.</p>
          <p>The Monitors must make weekly written reports, minutely stating all
		  breaches of the laws, all immoralities, irregularities or instances of indecent
		  behavior by any student, naming the offender, especially reporting injuries to
		  University property.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p205" n="205"/>
          <p>Any student appointed Monitor, wilfully failing or neglecting to
		  discharge his duties, was to be punished by admonition, or suspension not
		  exceeding three months, and for second offences suspended indefinitely, and
		  reported to the Trustees for expulsion.</p>
          <p>It was further ordered that the Tutors of the Preparatory School
		  should visit the rooms of the students three nights in the week, and anyone not
		  in his room was liable to be reprimanded by the aforesaid Tutor and punished by
		  the President of the University. And any Preparatory student under sixteen
		  years of age wilfully injuring the college buildings was to be publicly whipped
		  with not less than five or more than ten stripes. If over sixteen years of age
		  the punishment was public admonition and suspension for the first offence, and
		  expulsion for the second offence, “by the President without reporting to
		  the Trustees.”</p>
          <p>The foregoing summary shows that the objections of Chambers hereafter
		  mentioned were not without weight, and were not founded on a distorted view of
		  the letter and spirit of the substituted ordinance.</p>
          <p>Contemporaneous letters show vividly the consternation caused by the
		  great secession, as great in proportion to the numbers of the community as was
		  the march of the Plebians of Rome to the summit of Mons Sacer. The Steward,
		  Major Pleasant Henderson, wrote to a Trustee, Walter Alves, “The crisis
		  is awful. Communicate this fateful intelligence to Mr. Bennehan. I know how
		  much it will affect him.” Mr. Bennehan, whose christian name was Richard,
		  was the grandfather of Mr. Paul C. Cameron, long one of our ablest and most
		  efficient Trustees. He had resigned his Trusteeship the year before on account
		  of bodily infirmity.</p>
          <p>The President of the Board, Col. Polk, wrote to President Caldwell:
		  “The situation into which the imprudence and ill-directed conduct of the
		  seceding students has thrown the institution is truly distressing.” He
		  announced that the Trustees had agreed that those who had not left the Hill and
		  are willing to submit, may do so on terms, but those who have deserted
		  <pb xml:id="p206" n="206"/>without leave must apply to the Trustees. If the classes
		  have been so depleted as to make it impracticable to carry out the system, it
		  may be dispensed with; but, he added with the old Von Steuben instinct of
		  discipline, “when the classes grow the ordinance must be
		  enforced.”</p>
          <p>In another letter he says: “I. W. applies for re-admission. The
		  Trustees decline to act in individual cases, but will publish general terms.
		  They must promise to conform to the laws.”</p>
          <p>President Caldwell was of course deeply stirred. While not originally
		  responsible for the ordinance he endeavored with zeal to carry it into effect,
		  and he denounced the conduct of the rebellious students to the Trustees with
		  bitterness. In a letter to Richard Henderson, urging him to accept the
		  Professorship of Languages, he predicted that one-half or two-thirds of
		  “the conspirators” will ask leave to return. He adds pathetically,
		  “If so many of the youth of our country can so easily sacrifice the
		  opportunity of science and aim with so little reluctance a fatal blow at the
		  very existence of the University, it is for those who know by greater
		  experience the value of such an institution to baffle the waves of adversity
		  and steer the bark safely from the storm which assails it.” He then
		  declares though tempted by the offer of higher salary and a more congenial
		  chair, he had “foregone all temptations with the view of still sustaining
		  our tottering institution, assailed as it is by outward foes and rent as it has
		  been lately by an explosion of inward insubordination, rashness and
		  profligacy.”</p>
          <p>I find an allegorical paper among Dr. Caldwell's manuscripts entirely
		  in his handwriting, where and how published, or whether published at all, I
		  have been unable to ascertain, giving a picture of the morals and manners of
		  the students, which we must hope, is far too highly colored. It is entitled
		  “An Attempt at a Foul and Unnatural Murder.” Some parts of it are
		  worth quoting—“A respectable matron who has a large family of
		  children became an object of odium and conspiracy among them on account of the
		  strict restraint she imposed upon their vices and disorders. She had with
		  infinite regret observed in them for a long time a strong tendency to the
		  practise of getting drunk and then engaging in the acts of theft, lewdness and
		  riot, <pb xml:id="p207" n="207"/>which naturally incurred the necessity of much
		  lying, equivocation and duplicity.” Those not participating, refusing to
		  inform, “were involved in equal disgrace with the guilty.” Also
		  many “engaged in the practise of gaming, profane swearing, and insulting
		  the people they met with,” and when resistance was encountered, “by
		  threats of secret mischief or imposing blustering attempt to ward off
		  punishment.” Also they frequently played tricks, entered associations for
		  making noise, tumult, vociferation and confusion, to the interruption of the
		  family and the disgrace of their mother's house.</p>
          <p>She fell upon the expedient of appointing some of the number, if they
		  could not prevent, “to make report to her of those who misbehaved. As she
		  knew the more perfect the restraint could be made, the better it would be for
		  her offspring, she required the inspectors to be under oath to be faithful to
		  their duty. The reason of this particular was that their depravity had ripened
		  so far as it lay it down as a maxim, that mere promises were of no
		  force.”—“Only those promises which bound them to their duty
		  were pronounced to be of no force, but such as they made to one another,
		  binding them to faithfulness in their combination against the laws and rules of
		  the family, as to conceal the author of every immorality, and disorder, were
		  deemed as sacred and kept as inviolate as promises to do good among the
		  generality of mankind.”</p>
          <p>“After six weeks trial, they remonstrated against the oath. That
		  was withdrawn and a promise of honor substituted. Then many grew outrageous and
		  clearly evinced that it was not the oath that had excited their aversion, but
		  the necessity of giving up their beloved habits of licentiousness.”
		  “They suddenly and impetuously flew at her in a body, grasped her by the
		  throat and made a promiscuous outcry that they would rather die than submit to
		  such tyranny, that the laws of morality were not made for young people. That
		  God Almighty himself could not abide by such laws and that as for religion they
		  cared not half so much for the privilege of an orison to the Supreme Being, as
		  they did for the liberty of taking his name in vain, abusing him habitually to
		  his face, and damning all his progeny into eternal perdition. It was enough to
		  bring tears into the eyes of any <pb xml:id="p208" n="208"/>person of common
		  feeling to see how unrelenting the exasperation was which the love of their
		  vices had infused in them.”—“So blinded were they to the real
		  nature of their habits, that they acted as if they were doing no more than
		  <choice><sic>vidicating</sic><corr>vindicating</corr></choice>by a desperate struggle their proper
		  rights, while nothing could be plainer, than that an indissoluble attachment to
		  disorder and libertinism had brought their feelings to so irritated a
		  state.”—“Exerting every nerve they long kept their mother
		  gasping and half-expiring, till they grew weary of their efforts, and she
		  extricated herself from their clutches. Thus setting herself at liberty they
		  fled from the home, leaving a dread upon the mind of the astonished and
		  suffering parent lest they should ever become troublesome by solicitation to be
		  re-admitted.—If such application be made we hope that she will always
		  remember, that if she is not out of existence, it is neither for the want of a
		  wish nor of the utmost effort they could make to destroy her.”</p>
          <p>The records show that those applying for re-admission were few,
		  notwithstanding the repeal of the ordinance.</p>
          <p>I have discovered among the papers of General John Steele, a letter
		  written to him by Henry Chambers, who was, as I have said, a chief leader of
		  the insurgents, showing the students' side of the controversy. He begins by
		  saying, “Every friend to science must lament the injudicious conduct of
		  the Trustees in passing so odious a law. It was very objectionable in theory
		  but much more so in practice. It banished all harmony. The consequence of every
		  return of the Monitor was a contention between the students and the teacher and
		  the students and the Monitors. Frequently have I heard the return of the
		  Monitor contradicted in the public Hall, though he was acting under oath. What
		  young man of feeling would be willing to place himself in such a situation as
		  this? Who would suffer himself publicly to be called a perjured villain? And
		  the Monitor does this when he permits the correctness of his returns to be
		  questioned. When our Remonstrance was presented to the Trustees, they consented
		  to take off the oath but substituted a promise no less binding, and introduced
		  some provisions into the law which made it much more objectionable than it was
		  originally. Upon examination it will be found that <pb xml:id="p209" n="209"/>the
		  Monitors have cognizance now, not only of the conduct of their particular
		  classes but of the whole school. Thus a member of the lower class can admonish
		  and return a member of the Senior or Junior classes. And is it not degrading to
		  put a young man of the first stand in College under the absolute control of a
		  little Boy; a Boy that may be incapable of discriminating between proper and
		  improper conduct? It certainly is.”—“Perhaps an apology is
		  due you for troubling you with this letter. I beg that you will ascribe it to
		  the uncommon solicitude I feel to satisfy my friends as to the part I have
		  acted. If they condemn me it is my misfortune to be condemned for doing what I
		  conceive to be right and proper.”</p>
          <p>Chambers was one of the best students in his class and very near to
		  receiving his diploma. It must have been a profound conviction that made him
		  become the leader in the movement of resistance and ultimately of
		  secession.</p>
          <p>A letter dated September 23, 1805, published by Dr. S. B. Weeks in the
		  <hi rend="italics">University Magazine</hi>of April and May, 1894, from John
		  L. Conner to his brother, gives also the views of the students as to the
		  Monitor Ordinances. He called them oppressive and tyrannical. “A
		  remonstrance, signed by forty-five students, was handed to the Faculty and
		  Trustees, a fortnight before the expiration of the monitorial office. The
		  Trustees did not repeal the laws but modified them, and in that modification
		  they also magnified them, being still more severe (the oath excepted) than
		  before.” For the oath was substituted a solemn promise. Those who signed
		  the remonstrance were desired to meet in order to decide: 1st, Is the promise
		  binding? This was affirmed by a large majority. 2d, Is the law modified? The
		  vote on this was 22 in the negative against 19. “Of course, according to
		  the remonstrance and ‘private obligation,’ we were obliged to leave
		  College.” Mr. Conner goes on to express his admiration of the speakers
		  among the students. “The legislature of North Carolina cannot produce men
		  of such accurate judgment, reasoning and fluent language as was displayed in
		  the debates of our honorable body. * * * Those who signed (with some
		  exceptions) are the most respectable, both in their class and
		  character.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p210" n="210"/>
          <p>Conner gives his reason for joining the insurrection. “When I
		  was first asked to sign, I refused, alleging that I could agree to be governed
		  by the laws but not to be one that should enforce them, that the law would not
		  affect me as I boarded out of College: that I should not be made a monitor for
		  the same reason, and that I was seldom among the monitors.” He found
		  however that he was not only liable to be monitor but to be forced to live in
		  the College building. He had recently a severe attack of rheumatism and if he
		  should be sick in College he would have very little attendance and stand in
		  need of every necessity. “The fare also in College is miserable, for it
		  is common to see skippers in beef, which is the only flesh diet they have. In
		  this case they must fast, for by a later ordinance they are debarred from
		  getting a dinner elsewhere.”</p>
          <p>“Only four students, who signed the remonstrance, now remain in
		  the village. The rest have returned home to their parents and friends, who
		  highly approve of their conduct. They have no idea of their sons being perjured
		  by an extorted oath. The trustees have exhibited the affair in as bad a point
		  of view as possible, nothing more than what was to be expected. However, they
		  have since had the generosity to acknowledge an error in judgment.”</p>
          <p>Conner concluded to remain in Chapel Hill and pursue his studies
		  privately. He adds naively, “I assure you that I should not have signed,
		  had I not thought myself justifiable in so doing. But I had not the least idea
		  in its terminating in such disagreeable consequences.” He subsequently
		  accepted the offer of the Trustees that the seceders might return on
		  subscribing a promise to obey the laws of the institution.</p>
          <p>John Lancaster Conner was evidently a young man of parts. He was a
		  lineal descendant of the Quaker Lord Proprietor, and Governor of Carolina, John
		  Archdale, and grandson of Emmanuel Love, Secretary of the Province. He left the
		  University without graduating, probably on account of his rheumatism, and died
		  early.</p>
          <p>It must be admitted that the seceders adopted the wrong remedy for the
		  evil of which they complained. They injured themselves and injured the
		  University. They inflicted severe <pb xml:id="p211" n="211"/>pain on those who
		  loved them best, their parents and relatives. They would undoubtedly have
		  procured the repeal of the ordinance at an early date by continued strong, yet
		  courteous, petitions. It was passed by a thin Board, a bare quorum. The
		  Trustees were judicious and well-meaning, and it was repealed after only a few
		  months operation. The secession and violent language were a hindrance to early
		  repeal, because the Trustees could not yield to denunciation and threats.</p>
          <p>That I am correct in this criticism of the action of the students is
		  sustained by a letter from General Davie to Treasurer Haywood, of the date of
		  September 22, 1805. His opinion had commanding weight with the Trustees, and
		  that was decidedly against the ordinance. He wrote: “The late unfortunate
		  occurrence at the University is much to be lamented on many accounts, but most
		  of all for the ill-advised measure which gave birth to the conduct and feeling
		  of the students. An ordinance of the same kind was rejected several years ago
		  on a full consideration by the Board on the ground that the principle was
		  improper. These Monitors under the ordinance are not a species of Magistrates
		  but <hi rend="italics">real spies,</hi>and human nature revolts from the
		  principle of espionage in every shape. The corruption and depravity of London,
		  Paris, and other large cities, render its adoption necessary to the police, but
		  the most degraded wretch in the sinks of depravity could not be induced to
		  accept it as a public office, and always stipulates for the most profound
		  secrecy with regard to his employment. I do not believe that the duty of
		  Monitor or Censor has ever been carried further in any literary Institution
		  than to note absences from prescribed duties such as attendance on recitation,
		  prayers, Church, etc.” He counselled absolute repeal of the
		  ordinance.</p>
          <p>He was, however, far from approving the violent conduct of the
		  students. He advised that the ring leaders should not be re-admitted. He added:
		  “I have reflected much and seriously since this event on the cause of
		  this spirit of insubordination, and the means of preventing it. It has always
		  existed in a considerable degree; the ordinance may be considered as only an
		  accidental cause. I think the real causes may be found in the deficits of
		  domestic education in the Southern States, the <pb xml:id="p212" n="212"/>weakness
		  of parental authority, the spirit of the Times, the arrangements as to
		  vacation, and some errors by the Board which I will notice
		  hereafter.”</p>
          <p>“Every man of discernment who has lived forty or fifty years
		  must have observed and lamented the general decay of parental authority and the
		  consequent presumption and loose manners of our young men. Boys of 16 or 17
		  years, without judgment, without experience as to almost any knowledge of any
		  kind, arrogantly affect to judge for themselves, the trustees and even their
		  parents in matters of morality, of government, of education, in fact of
		  everything. The effect of the other general cause is visible throughout the
		  whole of their remonstrance. Nothing can be more ridiculous than
		  <hi rend="italics">Boys at school</hi>talking of ‘sacred regard for
		  their rights,’ ‘the high and imposing duty of resistance,’
		  and of ‘denouncing laws,’ etc., etc., the genuine slang of the
		  times, culled from the columns of newspapers; yet these very sounds are
		  attended with the most mischievous consequences. Over these causes however the
		  Board has no power or influence, but they must be considered to be counteracted
		  as far as practicable.”</p>
          <p>General Davie then states that he has observed that these disturbances
		  take place in the Fall of the year. This he attributes to the great length of
		  time the students have been confined at College. “They become tired and
		  disgusted with study, their minds generally acquire a sour, gloomy and restive
		  temperament, producing a general predisposition to any measure that may break
		  up the session, or interrupt business and distress the Faculty.”—To
		  remedy this he recommended having the two vacations on the same footing, i. e.
		  of the same length.</p>
          <p>“The difficulty we have continually experienced in the
		  management of youth at this institution, has obliged me to reflect on the means
		  we have used, and the nature of the Government of such institutions. I am now
		  perfectly convinced that the best governed Colleges are those which have the
		  most respectable Faculties, and the fewest <hi rend="italics">written</hi>
		  laws, and that we have committed a serious error in making an ordinance for
		  everything, in other words legislating too much. It is now my opinion that
		  after describing the kind of punishment to be used in the Establishment, and
		  reserving in all cases the punishment of <pb xml:id="p213" n="213"/>
		  <hi rend="italics">Expulsion</hi>to be confirmed by the Board, the rest should
		  be left to the discretion of the Faculty.”</p>
          <p>“It may require some reflection to see the justness of this
		  remark, owing to certain habits among us of acting and thinking, and I will
		  only add that the principles of parental government are the true models for
		  that of literary institutions for the youth of all kinds from the University
		  down to the common schools. The parental government has no written laws, and I
		  would observe that no mortal man could govern his family if he adopted that
		  mode. If he did his whole household would become, like these students, lawyers
		  and legislators, discussing his ordinances, chattering about ‘their
		  rights,’ ‘despotism,’ ‘duty of resistance,’ etc.,
		  etc. They would form themselves into revolutionary committees and be always
		  deliberating, remonstrating and revolting.”</p>
          <p>He doubted the propriety of publishing in the newspapers all the
		  distinctions made. The motive is good, but “it has the effect of filling
		  the young men with presumption, and a vain imaginary consequence. Perhaps it is
		  better to notice in the papers the Commencement honors only.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘It is dangerous to depart from the paths of
		  Experience,’ is a truth I am more and more convinced of every day I
		  live.”</p>
          <p>General Davie left Halifax for his plantation in South Carolina about
		  the first of November, and this letter contains the last counsels he gave to
		  the institution which he so long cherished. With the exception of his
		  recommendation of two vacations of equal length, the management of the
		  institution has been for many years on the line he advocated. During President
		  Caldwell's administration the Trustees ceased to interfere in the discipline,
		  and in 1876 the By-Laws were quietly laid aside and the requirement that
		  students behave as gentlemen was adopted as the general rule of conduct.</p>
          <p>The repeal of the obnoxious ordinance did not bring back the seceders.
		  In 1805 there were only three graduates and in 1806 only four. In 1807 they
		  rose to six and in 1808 to thirteen.</p>
          <p>The following list shows the names of the seceders:</p>
          <p>Of the Senior Class: Henry Y. Webb, of Hillsboro; Henry Chambers, of
		  Rowan; John Owen, of Bladen; Ransom Hinton, of Wake—4.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p214" n="214"/>
          <p>Juniors: Alfred M. Burton, Granville; Daniel Forney, Lincoln; Wm. B.
		  Meares, New Hanover; Wm. Campbell, Cumberland; Green H. Campbell, North
		  Carolina; James Young, Granville; Henry G. Williams, Northampton; John C.
		  Montgomery, Hertford; James A. Cain, Orange; James A. Harrington, Richmond;
		  John S. Young, North Carolina—11.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Sophomores,</hi>then spelt <hi rend="italics">Sophimores:</hi>John B. Brown, Bladen County; Wm. Cowan, New
		  Hanover County; Alexander Gilmour; Wm. Pegues, Cabarrus County; Benj. B.
		  Hunter, Tarboro; Samuel Spencer, Anson County; Lewis Duke, Warren County; James
		  Tignor; Thomas Goode, Virginia; John B. Jasper, New Bern; Haley I. Inge,
		  Louisiana; Horace B. Satterwhite, Salisbury; Wm. Gilmour, Halifax; Wm. Maclin,
		  Virginia; Wm. W. Williams, Martin County; Wm. Ferrand, Rowan County (probably),
		  Wm. Hayes, Pittsboro; Wm. Green, Warren County; Levi Whitted, Orange County
		  (probably); John Jones, New Hanover County (probably); Palmer Mosely, Lenoir
		  County; John L. Conner, Pasquotank County; Wm. Roulhac, Martin
		  County—23.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Freshman Class:</hi>Philemon Hawkins, Warren
		  County; Robert Collier, Chapel Hill; Joseph H. Pugh, Bertie County (probably);
		  Henry Watters, Orange County; Wm. Hinton, Bertie County; John Williams, Warren
		  County (probably); Wm. Williams, Martin County—7.</p>
          <p>Some of these attained prominence in after life: John Owen, was
		  Governor; Henry Y. Webb, a Judge; Wm. B. Meares, a State Senator; John Jones,
		  Speaker of the House. Some others attained the dignity of representing their
		  counties in the General Assembly. A few returned after a year's absence and
		  graduated. The majority settled down into the steady useful life of North
		  Carolina citizens.</p>
          <p>The Trustees were evidently sore at their defeat. Probably some of the
		  seceding students obtained admission into other institutions. In 1807 a letter
		  was sent to the Presidents of all the Colleges in the Union, transmitting
		  copies of “An Ordinance to Prevent the Admission into the University of
		  North Carolina of Improper Persons as Students.” It was signed by
		  Governor Benjamin Williams, as President of the Board. Accompanying
		  <pb xml:id="p215" n="215"/>it was a letter by him, stating that it was adopted
		  because of recent acts of hostility to authority and the laws, committed in
		  several American Colleges, and asking for a regular report of expulsions and
		  desertions.</p>
          <p>The scope of the ordinance was—</p>
          <p>1. Refusal to admit into the University of North Carolina any student
		  expelled from any University or College, or who has deserted therefrom to avoid
		  trial for offences.</p>
          <p>2. Requiring of all applicants for admission a declaration that they
		  have not been expelled and have not so deserted another institution.</p>
          <p>3. That the names, ages and residences of all such expelled students
		  and deserters shall be transmitted to all other institutions, and also recorded
		  in the journals of the Faculty and of the Board. Similar lists transmitted from
		  other institutions shall be similarly recorded.</p>
          <p>This document, apparently vindictive in its intent, by the use of the
		  word “deserters,” as applicable to students leaving the institution
		  pending charges, coupled with the inquisitorial character of the ordinance
		  appointing Monitors, intimates that the authorities regarded them as subject to
		  control similar to that used in the army over soldiers. The experiment is
		  interesting as a step in the transition from the old-time severity of Colleges,
		  as well as family government, to the more free, and, as results here proved,
		  more satisfactory modern methods.</p>
          <p>A difficulty which occurred in 1808 shows strongly the sensitiveness
		  of the Faculty in regard to their authority and that they had not lost their
		  pluck in consequence of the “great Rebellion.” Because of
		  dissatisfaction in regard to fare in Steward's Hall thirty-eight students,
		  among them eight Seniors and nine Juniors, in the list being such men as John
		  Branch, afterwards Governor and Secretary of the Navy, James F. Taylor,
		  Solicitor for the State, Mark Alexander, a member of Congress, signed a
		  petition to the Faculty, stating their grievances in strong language. Among
		  other things they said: “Having borne with patience for a considerable
		  time a failure of the Steward to comply with the bill of fare, and having
		  observed the inefficiency of individual complaints to produce an amendment,
		  <pb xml:id="p216" n="216"/>and seeing that our rights are infringed upon, we have
		  thought proper to petition the Faculty, in whom is vested the power to enforce
		  a compliance. Our grievances are daily accumulated, and they are such whose
		  importance demands immediate redress. We have long observed an insufficiency of
		  butter.—The beef has been such as to shock every sentiment of
		  decency—frequently unsound and covered with vermin.—The frequency
		  of this shows that it proceeds from carelessness in the Steward, and as such we
		  require an alteration.”</p>
          <p>The paper was drawn evidently by Maxwell Chambers, of Salisbury,
		  afterwards a physician of that place, a relative of Dr. Henry Chambers, leader
		  of the great Secession. It was considered by the Faculty to be offensive, the
		  use of the word “require” and the like savoring of rebellion. At
		  their suggestion another was substituted, stating that, “on reflection we
		  have discovered the inconsistency of our former petition, and therefore,
		  conformable to your opinion and also to our own view, we now offer one, in
		  which is contained a plain statement of every article, on which our complaints
		  are founded.” After enumerating the charges in regard to the deficiencies
		  of the table, they “entreat the interposition of your authority for a
		  redress of our grievances.”</p>
          <p>I wish I could add, as old children stories concluded, “and so
		  they lived happily together,” but the journal shows that two students,
		  one Senior John R. Stokes, and one Junior, Elias Foord, refused to sign the
		  amended paper and were suspended from the institution. Afterwards Stokes
		  petitioned the Trustees for restoration, alleging that he meant no disrespect
		  to the Faculty by his conduct and promising obedience to the laws. This was
		  approved by the Faculty and the Trustees, after a long preamble avowing their
		  determination to sustain the authority of the Faculty. They agreed to the
		  request, “as an offering of kindness and favor.” Stokes returned
		  and took his diploma, but Foord remained at home.</p>
          <p>As the Faculty, when satisfied of the guilt of one accused, often
		  declined to accept his denial, it sometimes probably happened that injustice
		  was done. In 1811 I find a paper signed by six students, some of whom
		  undoubtedly were during their adult <pb xml:id="p217" n="217"/>lives good citizens,
		  “attest upon their truth that they heard a certain person avow in such
		  manner as to convince them of his unaffected sincerity that he performed the
		  self-same act for the supposed commission of which J. Pinkston had been
		  suspended.” Pinkston was reinstated.</p>
          <p>The indignation of the friends of this student and another was so
		  great that when President Caldwell rose in the Chapel to announce their
		  suspension, twenty-three of their friends ostentatiously marched out in
		  disgust. Among them were such men as Charles L. Hinton, a State Treasurer; John
		  G. B. Roulhac, prominent merchant; and Arthur Hopkins, a Chief Justice. They
		  miscalculated the firmness of the President and his Faculty, who promptly
		  suspended them all. A strong and well-written letter of apology and regrets,
		  almost too fulsome, was promptly sent in by the humbled insurgents. Hear them.
		  “You, Revd. and respected Sir, are conversant with the history of man
		  from infancy to maturity. You have taught the young idea how to shoot. You have
		  poured the fresh instruction over the mind. You have fixed the worthy purpose
		  in the glowing breast.”</p>
          <p>“We have acted improperly.—It proceeded from the temporary
		  absence of reason and reflection.—We acknowledge our error with
		  contrition.—We ardently solicit and respectfully hope for forgiveness for
		  this our late offence and particularly for the conduct of those of tender age
		  who may have been led into error by our example.”</p>
          <p>“With that respect, Reverend and Revered Sir, that your
		  character and conduct universally command, and of which you are so highly
		  deserving, we presume to add that of our esteem and individual affection, let
		  the fate of this letter be what it may.”</p>
          <p>To this eloquent letter, which likewise contained disclaimer of
		  intentional disrespect and promise of future good conduct, the cold answer was
		  returned by the President, that after their return to their homes the petition
		  might be taken up and considered. Most of them were reinstated and took their
		  degrees.</p>
          <p>In one case an extraordinary amount of contrition was demanded. The
		  sentence was that the offender should be indefinitely <pb xml:id="p218" n="218"/>
		  suspended unless he should acknowledge to the Faculty in the presence of all
		  the students that he had done wrong, secondly that he should crave the
		  indulgence and good will of the Faculty and particularly of the President,
		  thirdly that he should assure the Faculty that he would obey the laws in the
		  future.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the good President wrote out the letters of contrition to be
		  signed by the offenders. One of them is made to say, when summoned to answer
		  the Professors for neglect of duty, “It is with shame and confusion I
		  confess the low and vulgar expressions in which I suffered my obstinate and
		  indecent passions to vent themselves in return for their solicitude for my
		  welfare, * * * and I will never again be guilty of such language, or of any
		  voluntary infraction of the laws of this institution which is so sacredly
		  devoted to the production and advancement of good morals and science in the
		  hearts and understandings of the young.” The student who signed the
		  above-mentioned paper—what is often called in the country a
		  “lie-bill,” was so agitated that he forgot to dot his i's in
		  William; a grammatical neglect of atrocious magnitude in those days.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these occasional outbreaks it is refreshing to find
		  periods of tranquillity. A sentimental observer writing in February, 1803,
		  praises students and Faculty in glowing language. He says “voluntary
		  acquiescence stamps a reverence on the minds of all. Contentment extends its
		  influence through every department and beams with placid serenity on every
		  brow.”</p>

          <head>SAYINGS AND INCIDENTS OF A COMICAL NATURE.</head>
          <p>Comical incidents and sayings form so large part of University life
		  that I record some as specimens of what in the old days were considered
		  amusing. I begin with two pictures of incorrigible boys.</p>
          <p>For a short while during this period little descriptive notes were
		  kept in a book, of which the following are specimens of the worst. For the most
		  part they are favorable.</p>
          <p>“R. B. is very indolent, seldom or ever recites his lessons
		  well; and absents himself from the class at recitations, and for his absences
		  seldom produces but frivolous excuses. He has made very little improvement and
		  the repeated admonitions of <pb xml:id="p219" n="219"/>his teachers are
		  insufficient to rouse him to industry and to induce him to apply himself to
		  study.”</p>
          <p>“J. V., who reads nothing but Virgil, neither construes or
		  parses very correctly. He is possessed of only moderate genius and is much
		  inclined to be indolent. He takes little pains to improve and seldom remembers
		  on one day what he has been told on the preceding. He is nearly grown and
		  though he has been much at school, he has made but little progress and
		  certainly will never be proficient in the languages.”</p>
          <p>Of the anecdotes some are true, some mythical.</p>
          <p>A letter written February 8, 1809, from Henry H. Watters to his
		  mother, who lived near Wilmington, shows that, while the spirit of
		  insubordination had not entirely died out, the buoyancy of youth had caused the
		  students to turn their attention to other matters than resisting the Faculty,
		  even using intensive culture to promote the growth of sprouting beard.</p>
          <p>“The young men have for some time been very irregular in their
		  conduct, and yesterday one received a public admonition and six or seven a
		  private one. None have merited suspension or expulsion. A little mischief now
		  and then is expected from young men and only serves to remind teachers of their
		  duty. I have not spent but one quarter uselessly and that was in buying cider.
		  I have purchased other things, but they are necessaries. I have received the
		  articles which I purchased last fall at a vendue; A. Reaves, a noted gambler,
		  was my security, so you see I have not lost my credit. I had a pair of shorts
		  made of the cotton cassimere and am resolved to shine here, if not with you. My
		  beard and whiskers are sprouting finely. I shave them once a week and grease
		  them every night with tallow. I am told by some of my fellow students that
		  greasing is a fine thing to make them grow, and I have no doubt that warm
		  weather will accelerate the growth very much. You have again attacked me about
		  my cough. I can tell you for the hundredth time that I have none. Next time you
		  write to me about it you shall hear that I incessantly spit hogsheads of blood
		  every day, eat nothing, and am nothing but skin and bone.”</p>
          <p>“As politics are so often the topics of conversation I have
		  written to Mr. Boylan to send me his paper and apply to Papa
		  <pb xml:id="p220" n="220"/>for the money. Mr. Caldwell is more fond of conversing
		  on that than on any other subject, and without some information on the subject
		  I will be unable to converse with him.”</p>
          <p>When Paul C. Cameron matriculated in 1824 he had a letter of
		  introduction from his father to a senior, James M. Wright, son of Judge Wright
		  of Memphis, who lived in the South Building. Young Paul was a typical Highland
		  Scotchman in appearance. His hair was red, his face was red, and he wore a suit
		  of clothes of the color called turkey-red, made at home by his loving mother.
		  As he walked up alone from the hotel he passed a group of students sitting on
		  the steps of the north entrance of the Old East Building. One of them,
		  attracted by the passing flash of rubicund light, called out, “Red
		  Bird!” The Freshman's blood was as red as his face, hair and garments. He
		  stopped and offered battle. “I can't whip you all at once,” he
		  savagely said, “but if you will come out one at a time, I will whip every
		  one of you.” No one felt inclined to accept the challenge. Young Wright
		  took him in as his roommate and he never was hazed.</p>
          <p>The following incident illustrates Dr. Caldwell in his gentler mood.
		  He descried a student fastening a goose to the ridge of the roof of the East
		  Building. “Ah, Joseph, Joseph,” said he, “I suppose thou art
		  fixing up that poor bird there as an emblem of thyself.” This was the
		  eminent editor of the <hi rend="italics">National Intelligencer,</hi>Joseph
		  Gales. Dr. Hooper adds, “Perhaps that severe cut from his teacher may
		  have goaded the youthful truant to throw away the goose forever afterwards,
		  reserving only a quill to write himself into renown.”</p>
          <p>Among the mythical, I class that which tells of a plot to steal Dr.
		  Caldwell's carriage and haul it to the foot of the hill on the Pittsboro road,
		  a mile off, and leave it there. The Doctor, ever watchful, not averse to what
		  was not considered dishonorable in that day, eavesdropping, heard of the
		  scheme. When night came he hid in the vehicle and was transported by the jovial
		  draught boys to what is now Purefoy's Mill, once Merritt's. As they were about
		  to return to their rooms, he poked his head out of the window and blandly said,
		  “Now, young gentlemen! will you please haul me back to my
		  residence?” As the ascent <pb xml:id="p221" n="221"/>was 250 feet towards the
		  skies the chapfallen students were nearly exhausted, so much so that no further
		  punishment was inflicted. I class this as mythical, although firmly credited in
		  the old University circles, because the same story is told of an English
		  pedagogue.</p>
          <p>The next incident is probably true. The Doctor's nickname was Bolus,
		  abbreviated from Diabolus. He got wind of a project to steal his turkeys, which
		  he was fattening for some festival dinner. Hiding near the coop, he heard one
		  fowl searcher stealthily creep therein and seizing the gobbler remark to his
		  confederates, “Here, boys, is old Bolus!” Then grabbing the hen,
		  “And here is Mrs. Bolus.” The Doctor then rushed forward so rapidly
		  that in order to escape, the turkeys were dropped. He had them killed next day
		  and invited the marauders and others to the dining at which they were served.
		  After carving he looked significantly at the ringleader and asked,
		  “Mr.—, will you have a slice of old Bolus, or do you prefer a slice
		  of Mrs. Bolus?” He then gave the same option to the other delinquents
		  successively. It is said that there was never a more severe punishment.</p>
          <p>At one time it was the rule to require written excuses for
		  delinquencies. Dr. Caldwell said, “Mr.—, you have offered seven
		  excuses to four absences.” “All right, Doctor! let the surplus
		  three go on the absences of next week.”</p>
          <p>After graduation, Matthew Troy was a Tutor in the Preparatory
		  Department—the hero of a story recorded by Dr. Hooper in his “Fifty
		  Years Since.” “I told you,” he says, “that I remembered
		  Mr. Troy with gratitude; but I believe nothing he ever taught me imprinted
		  itself so deeply on my memory, as the burst of eloquence which the boys told me
		  he had made, when he was a student, upon the charms of Miss Hay, afterwards the
		  first Mrs. Gaston. Troy was given to the grandiloquent style, and on that
		  occasion Miss Hay, who was the belle of the day, with a small party came to
		  visit the Dialectic library. It was then kept in one of the common rooms
		  inhabited by four students; and you may judge of the tumult that was excited by
		  such visitation and how much sweeping and fixing up was required, and how many
		  frightened boys ran to the neighboring <pb xml:id="p222" n="222"/>rooms, and shut
		  the doors, all but a small crack to peep through. On this memorable occasion,
		  Troy had fixed himself in a corner of the room, whence he could contemplate the
		  beautiful apparition in silent ecstacy. After she was gone the librarian called
		  him out of his trance, and said: “Well, Troy, what do you think of
		  her?” “Oh! sir, she's enough to melt the frigidity of a stoic, and
		  excite rapture in the breast of a hermit”; to which he might have added:
		  ‘And like another Helen, fire another Troy.’ A man that could talk
		  in that way, appeared to me, in those days, to have reached the top of
		  Parnassus.”</p>
          <p>The following story was told me by Dr. Johnston B. Jones, of Chapel
		  Hill and Charlotte.</p>
          <p>There came a long, lank student from a region where literary culture
		  was not abundant. The members of the Faculty were generally preachers and
		  attendance on Prayers in the chapel twice a day was rigorously enforced. At the
		  end of the first week the neophyte was reported habitually absent. He was sent
		  for in hot haste “to appear before the Awful Tribunal,” as the
		  students called Faculty meetings. “Mr.—!” said President
		  Caldwell in his severest tones, “the Faculty have learned with deep
		  regret that you have been in the last week absent from Prayers fourteen times.
		  What have you to say, Sir?” With bland and innocent tones the culprit
		  made the shocking answer, “I don't hold with Prars, Sir!” Without
		  deigning to discuss the constitutional provision that every man has the right
		  to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, he was sternly
		  informed that if he could not hold with Prayers, the University could not hold
		  with him.</p>
          <p>The late Judge William H. Battle, of the Graduating class of 1820, is
		  authority for the happening on our University rostrum of an incident, which is
		  sometimes credited elsewhere. A Freshman, who had a face of portentous gravity,
		  had a coat of Revolutionary pattern, blue, with brass buttons, with short waist
		  and tail reaching nearly to his heels. It was the rule that the students in
		  turn should declaim a short extract of prose or poetry before the Faculty after
		  evening Prayers. When our Freshman's time came he mounted the rostrum and in a
		  peculiarly lugubrious and sing-song tone began Addison's Evening Hymn. He made
		  no gesture until he reached the lines: <pb xml:id="p223" n="223"/>
		  <q direct="unspecified"><lg type="hymn"><l>“Soon as the evening shades prevail,</l><l>The Moon takes up the wondrous tale,”</l></lg></q>and then he reached for the tail of his Revolutionary coat,
		  and gently waved it in the air.</p>
          <p>Some years later I witnessed a ludicrous scene something like that. A
		  Senior of 1853, Wm. B. Dusenbury, was usually so droll that every one expected
		  from him a humorous speech, called “a Funny.” Senior speaking came
		  on, when every member of the class delivered an original oration. To the
		  disgust of his audience, whose risible muscles were ready, expecting to be
		  called into action by Dusenbury's wit, his speech was as dry as that of the
		  average orator. But fortunately for our fun a fly happened to alight on his
		  nose. Pausing in his utterance he gazed at the annoying animal in a cross-eyed
		  way, and deliberately proceeded to catch him. After opening his hand to
		  ascertain whether he had succeeded, he proceed with his speech. It was
		  inexpressibly ludicrous. There was a wild burst of applause and
		  inextinguishable laughter. Dr. Mitchell was sitting several yards in front of
		  me and it added to our amusement to see how his bald head and huge frame,
		  rocking for several minutes, gave evidence of his appreciation of the
		  comicalness of the situation.</p>
          <p>Dr. William Hooper says, “Our geographical recitations were
		  enlivened by some rare scenes, one or two of which I will venture to
		  relate.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Mr. Sawney,’ says the Professor, ‘can you
		  tell me anything about the animals of Greenland?’ ‘Yes, sir;
		  there's one called the seal.’ ‘What kind of animal is it?’
		  ‘I don't remember exactly, Sir, but I believe he says it is a very
		  amphib—a very amphibibobus kind of animal, Sir.’ The boys plagued
		  him about this new kind of animal until he became as irritable as a nest of
		  wasps by the way-side. Another student whom we will disguise under the name of
		  Riggie, used to amuse various companions by telling the story upon Sawney. Now
		  Riggie was the last man that ought to have made people merry over the blunders
		  of others, for he had got his own nickname by his ludicrous pronunciation of
		  Riga, a Russian town on the Baltic. He was asked where were the chief towns in
		  Russia. He mentioned <pb xml:id="p224" n="224"/>several, and among them Riggie on
		  the Baltic, pronouncing the first syllable of the last word as it is heard in
		  balance. The name Riggie stuck to him forever afterwards. But it often happens
		  that he who smarts under a joke is most ready to avert pursuit by throwing
		  ridicule upon others. Sawney, goaded by Riggie's persecution, determined to
		  avenge himself; so he laid a trap for him. He got a friend to invite a company
		  including Riggie into his room, and to call for the story, while in the
		  meantime, Sawney concealed himself under the bed. Riggie, alas! unconscious of
		  the Trojan horse within the walls, was going on with his story, full sail, the
		  audience convulsed with the enjoyment and the anticipation of the paulo-post
		  future; when in the very fifth act of the drama, out popped Sawney from his
		  ambush, and pitched into the dismayed comedian. I shall not attempt to describe
		  the battle; but it may well be supposed that Sawney, with wounded pride and
		  bursting with long imprisoned rage, fought with more desperation, and that his
		  adversary startled by a foe emerging suddenly from ambush, must have fought at
		  a disadvantage.”</p>
          <p>Here is Dr. Hooper's description of Steward's Hall. “Do you wish
		  to know the ordinary bill of fare fifty years ago? As well as I recollect board
		  per annum was thirty-five dollars! This, as you may suppose, would not support
		  a very luxurious table, but the first body of Trustees were men who had seen
		  the Revolution and they thought that that sum would furnish as good rations as
		  those lived on who won our liberties. Coarse corn bread was the staple food. At
		  dinner the only meat was a fat middling of bacon, surmounting a pile of
		  coleworts; and the first thing after grace was said, (and sometimes before),
		  was for one man, by a single horizontal sweep of his knife, to separate the
		  ribs and lean from the fat, monopolize all the first to himself, and leave the
		  remainder for his fellows. At breakfast we had wheat bread and butter and
		  coffee. Our supper was coffee and the corn bread left at dinner, without
		  butter. I remember the shouts of rejoicing when we had assembled at the door,
		  and some one jumping up and looking in at the window, made
		  proclamation—‘Wheat bread for supper, boys!’ And that wheat
		  bread, over which such rejoicings were made, believe <pb xml:id="p225" n="225"/>me,
		  gentlemen and ladies, was manufactured out of wheat we call seconds, or, as
		  some term it, grudgeons. You will not wonder, if, after such a supper, most of
		  the students welcomed the approach of night, that as beasts of prey, they might
		  go a prowling, and seize upon everything eatable within the compass of one or
		  two miles; for, as I told you, our boys were followers of the laws of Lycurgus.
		  Nothing was secure from the devouring torrent. Beehives though guarded by a
		  thousand stings—all feathered tenants of the roost—watermelon and
		  potato patches, roasting ears, etc., in fine everything that could appease
		  hunger, was found missing in the morning. Those marauding parties at night were
		  often wound up with setting the village to rights.”</p>
          <p>A letter from State Treasurer Haywood in 1803 to Dr. Caldwell shows
		  that according to modern ideas complaint of Steward's Hall fare may have been
		  well founded. “<hi rend="italics">In re</hi>matter of having Mr. and
		  Mrs. Love furnish butter at supper, we think with you that a supper of Tea and
		  Bread, or Coffee and Bread, without either butter or meat, has few charms, and
		  can be but illy fitted to gratify palates accustomed to better fare, but the
		  contract has been made and published and cannot be changed.” He adds with
		  apparent naivete that there would be “no objection to students adding
		  Butter out of their private Purse, but not to be charged to parents or
		  guardians.” He means that the University should not include such
		  self-furnished luxury in its official rendering of expenditures.</p>
          <p>“Dr. Caldwell,” adds Dr. Hooper, “seems to have made
		  it a part of his fixed policy, that no evil-doer should hope to escape by the
		  swiftness of his heels. He was in the habit of rambling about at night, in
		  search of adventures, and whenever he came across an unlucky wight engaged in
		  taking off a gate, building a fence across the street, driving a brother calf
		  or goat into the Chapel, or any similar exploit of genius, he no sooner hove in
		  sight than he gave chase.”</p>
          <p>“I will relate,” said Dr. Hooper, one of these nocturnal
		  adventures, and it was only <hi rend="italics">‘<foreign xml:lang="lat">unum
		  e pluribus</foreign>.’</hi></p>
          <p>“Dr. Caldwell was the podas okus Achilles of Chapel Hill, and he
		  had more occasion for powers of pursuit than of contest, for his antagonists
		  uniformly took to flight. You call this <pb xml:id="p226" n="226"/>a ‘fast
		  age,’ gentlemen, and so it is, but I don't know a man of this generation
		  who is faster than was Dr. Caldwell. He was not satisfied to take two days in
		  getting to Raleigh. He and I have set out for the metropolis in the morning,
		  and stopped the first night at Pride's, ten miles this side, such was the state
		  of the roads. Who knows but such snail-like progress as this suggested to him
		  the first idea of the present railroad from Beaufort to the mountains, the
		  honor of which, I believe, is now conceded to him? Now, O! muse, that didst
		  inspire Homer to describe Achilles' pursuit of Hector, three times round the
		  walls of Troy; or thou, gentle muse, who didst breathe thy soft afflatus upon
		  Ovid when he described the race between Apollo and fair Daphne; or thou,
		  Caledonian muse, who didst preside over Walter Scott, when he sung the race of
		  Fitz James after Murdock of Alpine, or over Robert Burns, when he made immortal
		  the flight of Tam O'Shanter from the witches,—either of you or all of the
		  nine at once, assist me to describe the race between President Caldwell and
		  Sophomore Faulkner (James T. Falconer), on the night of the....day
		  of........18... The President lived at that time where the President's new
		  residence is being erected, and was returning about bed-time “from
		  walking up and down the earth,”
		  <ref xml:id="ref4" target="#n4">1</ref>
		  <note xml:id="n4" anchored="true" target="#ref4">1 The appropriateness of this sentence is evident, as his nickname
				was Diabolus, or Bolus.</note>to see if any of the students were where
		  they ought not to be. As he was mounting the stile which stood where Dr.
		  Wheat's (now Dr. Alexander's) southeast corner now stands, he spied two young
		  men, busily engaged in building a fence from that corner across the street to
		  the opposite corner. The lads had just before his appearance heard that
		  portentous snapping of the ankles, which was a remarkable peculiarity of his
		  locomotion. As soon as they heard this premonitory crepitation, (a providential
		  warning of danger, like the rattle of the rattlesnake), one of the
		  fence-makers, whose <foreign xml:lang="fre">nom de
		  guerre</foreign>was Dog,
		  skulked into a corner and was passed by. Faulkner sprang forward. But I forgot
		  that Homer always spends a line or two in describing his heroes, before he
		  brings them into action. So I must suspend the race, till I have given my
		  audience some idea of Faulkner's person and character. He was a tall, bony,
		  gaunt and grim looking fellow, with <pb xml:id="p227" n="227"/>shaggy threatening
		  eyebrow—had been at Norfolk during the war of 1813-14, as a soldier or
		  officer, and had contracted a soldier's love of adventure and frolic, and, like
		  Macbeth, would have run from nothing born of mortal, if he had been engaged in
		  a good cause. But building a fence across the street at night, his conscience
		  set down as a deed of darkness. His conscience made him a coward, but perhaps
		  it enabled him to run the faster, and he might have escaped had any but
		  “the swift-footed Achilles” given chase. But fate had doomed him to
		  lose this race: </p>
          <lg type="poem">

          </lg>
          <p>“Having thus disposed of one of the fence-makers, the victorious
President went back in quest of the other. After beating the bush
awhile, he returned to the college, where in the meantime, Faulkner,
with clipped wings and fallen crest, had gathered a party in one of
the rooms, and was telling the fortunes of the night. Little did he
dream that his exulting conqueror was standing close by, in the dark,
listening to every word. “And what became of Dog?” inquired one of the
party. “Oh! Dog, he took to the woods, and I dare say he is running
yet.” When the court met, the next day, to try the delinquents, it
appeared in evidence from the Tutor, that Dog was the sobriquet of
Junius Moore. He was accordingly startled by a summons served upon him
by old Daniel Bradley, the college constable, to appear before the
Faculty as particeps criminis with Faulkner. Gentlemen, you have read
Cicero's graphic description <pb xml:id="p228" n="228"/>of the confusion
of face and dumbfoundedness of Cataline's accomplices when the consul
confronted them with all the damning evidence of their guilt, you can
conceive and none but you, the looks and behavior of the two
fence-makers, when Dog was thus unexpectedly arraigned at the
bar.”</p>
          <p>“As for Dog, he deserved a better name, for he was a
native born poet, and he and Philip Alston (a graduate of 1829), are
among the few of our alumni on whose birth Melpomene did smile. Had
Moore lived he might have written something to justify these
praises. Alston lived long enough to leave some memorial of his
genius, but, alas! not long enough for our fame or for his own.</p>

F. Faulcon, of Granville. Junius Alexander Moore was a son of James,
and grandson of General James Moore, of Revolutionary fame, whose
father, Colonel Maurice Moore, was second son of Governor James Moore,
of South Carolina. His mother was Rebecca Davis, aunt of the late
eminent George Davis, of Wilmington, and Bishop Thomas F. Davis, of
South Carolina. Junius was a lawyer, removed to Alabama and died in
early manhood, leaving daughters but no son. The following elegy by
him on a famous Chapel Hill horse has come down to us. It certainly
has merit.</p>

          <head>CHAPMAN PRESIDENT—HIS ADMINISTRATION.</head>
          <p>In 1812 we find in the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register</hi>an
		  enumeration of the improvements and advantages at the University. “In six
		  months the Principal (South) Building will be ready for the reception of
		  inhabitants. There will then be accommodations for eighty students. There will
		  be separate halls for the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, one for the
		  Library, and a Public Hall for Prayers. Each of the Society libraries contains
		  800 to 1,000 volumes, that of the University 1,500, a total of 3,100 to 3,500
		  volumes. A society has been recently formed for the study of sacred music. An
		  organ ordered to be built in New York is already finished. Public worship is
		  held every Sunday in Person Hall, which the students are bound to attend. The
		  Faculty consists of a President, three Professors and one Tutor. The Academy
		  for boys, under the charge of Rev. Abner W. Clopton, is subject to the
		  supervision of the President. In it there are four classes. Every possible
		  attention is paid to improvement in reading, writing, spelling and the English
		  Grammar. Wm. Mimerall is now a resident of Chapel Hill for the purpose of
		  teaching the French language, and is well qualified. The sessions run as
		  follows: The first from 1st of January to 24th of May. The second from the 20th
		  June to the 15th of November. The expenses are for the first session in the
		  dining-room and College, Diet, $30; Tuition, $10; Room-rent,
		  $1; Servant hire, $1.50; Library, 50 cents; Washing, $8;
		  candles and wood, $4; Bed, $3.50; Total, $58.50. For the
		  second session, the same. Plainness of dress and manners will be the
		  rule.”</p>
          <p>It is noticeable that “every possible attention” was not
		  promised for Arithmetic. Whether Rev. Clopton was weak in that branch, or that
		  he left it to be taught in the University classes we are not informed.</p>
          <p>Dr. Caldwell, although his masterly temperament indicated that his
		  proper place in the University world was that of Chief Executive officer, was
		  also a devotee of Mathematics. At this period love of his chosen science
		  predominated over his sense <pb xml:id="p231" n="231"/>of duty for being chief
		  ruler in the University world. He longed for time in which he could complete
		  his work on Geometry and perfect himself in the knowledge of Astronomy and use
		  of astronomical instruments. He accordingly proposed to the trustees to appoint
		  a President in his place, and to give him the chair of Mathematics. They
		  graciously adopted the plan and elected to the first place Rev. Robert Hett
		  Chapman, D.D., a Presbyterian minister.</p>
          <p>Rev. Dr. Chapman was a son of a Presbyterian minister of New York, who
		  was a warm Whig in Revolutionary days, Rev. Jedediah Chapman. Robert was born
		  in Orange, New Jersey, and graduated at Princeton in 1789. He was then
		  Instructor in Queen's College, New Brunswick, until licensed to preach in 1793.
		  For a year or two he was a Missionary in the Southern States and was then
		  pastor at Rahway, installed in 1796, and afterwards took charge of a church in
		  Cambridge, New York. To Dr. Caldwell's letter asking him to allow the use of
		  his name for the Presidency of this University, he complied reluctantly with
		  the request, saying, “in doing this I conceive that I should be called to
		  relinquish the dearest object of my heart, the advancement of the cause of our
		  Glorious Redeemer, but I would hope that my usefulness in this respect would be
		  enlarged.” He adds, “I am in the midst of usefulness and reputation
		  in this part of the world, but my salary, which the people have refused to
		  increase, is utterly inadequate to the expense of a growing family.” The
		  letter is dated February 12, 1812.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Nominations in their report to the Board December 12,
		  1812, feelingly state that they accepted the resignation of Dr. Caldwell, but
		  “the unpleasant forebodings at the resignation of an officer so
		  distinguished for his zeal, usefulness and talents is in some sort dissipated
		  by his willingness to accept the Professorship of Mathematics.” The Board
		  unanimously elected Dr. Chapman President, with a salary of $1,200, and
		  Dr. Caldwell, Professor, with $1,000. The Trustees present were:
		  Governor Wm. Hawkins, Chairman ex-officio; Rev. Joseph Caldwell, John Haywood,
		  Archibald D. Murphey, Duncan Cameron, Calvin Jones, David Stone, Atlas Jones,
		  Henry Potter, Montfort Stokes and Robert Williams, the Treasurer.
		  <pb xml:id="p232" n="232"/>The latter must not be confounded with Robert Williams,
		  M.D., of Pitt, also a Trustee. The General Assembly promptly elected the new
		  President a member of the Board of Trustees.</p>
          <p>The administration of Dr. Chapman is generally thought to have been a
		  failure, but his defects seem to have been somewhat exaggerated, and some of
		  the troubles proceeded evidently from the hot party spirit engendered by the
		  war. He was a man of sincere piety, of strong principles, zealous in the spread
		  of religion. He was a preacher, according to the testimony of Chief Justice
		  Nash and Dr. James E. Morrison, very earnest, interesting and effective. Judge
		  Nash said: “He was more highly gifted with power on his knees than any
		  man I know. His public prayers warmed the hearts of all who heard them.”
		  His manner in preaching was earnest and tender and he was successful beyond
		  what is common in securing attention.</p>
          <p>There was to his management of the University, however, a fatal
		  obstacle. He was a Peace Federalist and his students were in favor of the war.
		  It is difficult for us at this day to realize the keen disappointment and even
		  rage felt by our people at the disasters on land, such as the surrender of
		  Hull, the failure of the Canadian Invasion, and the capture of the Capital, and
		  on the other hand the wild exultation over our naval victories. The one
		  conspicuous land victory, gained after the signing of the treat, of peace, that
		  of New Orleans, carried the American commander into the Presidential chair.</p>
          <p>The Republican leaders had the address to turn the dissatisfaction
		  arising from the imbecile conduct of the war from themselves to their
		  opponents. They claimed the credit of all the victories and placed the
		  discredit of defeats on the odious Federalists, who, they alleged, gave
		  blue-light signals to British ships on our coast, intrigued at Hartford to join
		  New England with Old England, encouraged Great Britain and discouraged
		  Americans by denouncing the war as unjust and inexpedient. In the minds of most
		  people Federalist was synonymous with Traitor.</p>
          <p>Dr. Chapman was too honest to conceal or to tone down his views. The
		  friction which the strict and irritative methods of discipline made inevitable
		  at all times, was considered more <pb xml:id="p233" n="233"/>harsh in the days of
		  unreasoning partisan hatreds. If the good Doctor after peace was declared had
		  continued unwaveringly in his executive position he might have lived down the
		  memory of the outbreaks, which are connected so unpleasantly with his name. Dr.
		  Caldwell had experiences quite as disastrous to his reputation as an
		  administrator, but he continued so long and bravely in his position that his
		  failures were forgotten in the light of his subsequent successes. Dr. Chapman
		  preferred to go back to his more congenial work as a pastor and left his
		  reputation as a University President to the mercy of adverse critics.</p>
          <p>I give sketches of two outbreaks, which occurred during his
		  administration, which illustrate the peculiar difficulties under which he
		  labored, as well as the spirit of the times in Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>About twelve months after his inauguration in January, 1814, a series
		  of outrages at night was perpetrated on his property. Dr. Caldwell, who could
		  not resist the impulse to take the place of leader, determined to ferret out
		  the offenders by process of law. Accordingly he applied to a Justice of the
		  Peace, Major Pleasant Henderson, for a warrant against the unknown
		  perpetrators, intending to call up all the students and examine them on oath.
		  He was unaware that such precepts, called “general warrants,” had
		  been resisted successfully in England by John Wilkes, had been decided to be
		  illegal by Chief Justice Camden, that our people were so much interested in the
		  controversy as to name one county Wilkes and another Camden, and had prohibited
		  such warrants in our fundamental law, the Declaration of Rights. He forgot in
		  his zeal that similar warrants, called Writs of Assistance to enforce the
		  Navigation Acts, had led to armed resistance in New England and other
		  commercial sections. The Justice refused the application, being rightly
		  instructed as to the unlawfulness of general warrants; but the fiery doctor,
		  who could be no more easily diverted from his purpose than a well-trained
		  blood-hound from the track of a fleeing criminal, amended the precept by
		  inserting the names of five students. A solemn court was held. The panic in
		  this little community cannot be imagined. There were “great searchings
		  <pb xml:id="p234" n="234"/>of spirit.” The charges were, 1st., breaking into
		  and entering the stable of President Chapman, and cutting the hair from the
		  tail of a horse of the said Chapman; 2d., “for taking away and secreting
		  a cart, the property of said Chapman;” 3d., “entering said
		  Chapman's premises and turning over or throwing down a house; 4th., taking from
		  its hinges and carrying away one of said Chapman's gates.”</p>
          <p>It is interesting to note the behavior of the students under this
		  trying ordeal. It is rather surprising that there was no combination for the
		  purpose of refusing to answer. Possibly the Federalists among the students
		  sympathized with the President. Some declared emphatically that they knew
		  nothing about the matter. Among these were Aaron V. Brown, Bryan Grimes, father
		  of the gallant General of the same name, and John Y. Mason. Others said that
		  they knew nothing themselves, but gave the names of suspected persons, some of
		  whom were undoubtedly not guilty. A few gave direct evidence tending to
		  criminate Chambers, Thornton, Peebles, Knox and Haywood, the men charged by Dr.
		  Caldwell, and as these refused to exculpate themselves, they were probably
		  dismissed from the University, though the record has been lost. I knew Francis
		  A. Thornton nearly half a century afterwards, when he was a member of the
		  Secession Convention of 1861, a neighbor of Nat. Macon, a mild-mannered,
		  gentlemanly, venerable man, with no suspicion of tar on his hands, tho' he was
		  a fire-eating Secessionist. Thomas J. Haywood lived to be a Supreme Court Judge
		  of Tennessee. All were probably good men moved by party feelings. The justice's
		  examination violated all the rules of evidence. Leading questions were asked,
		  the witnesses were required to give their suspicions, and hearsay evidence was
		  even admitted as to what suspicions were entertained by others, and as to what
		  students knew of any of the perpetrators. Among the innocent men whose names
		  were mentioned as suspected was the eminent divine, Dr. Francis L. Hawks. A
		  few, among them Bedford Brown and Edmund Wilkins, lawyer of Virginia, refused
		  to answer these illegal questions, but strong men, such as David F. Caldwell,
		  George C. Dromgoole, Charles L. Hinton, Charles Manly, Willie P. Mangum, appear
		  to have made a <pb xml:id="p235" n="235"/>clean breast of the facts they knew as
		  well as the imaginations of their hearts. This is strong evidence that there
		  were not a few who sympathized with the insulted President in his views. There
		  was a strong anti-war party in the State, probably in the University, but they
		  were of the modest and silent order.</p>
          <p>Dr. Chapman was likewise insulted by receiving an anonymous letter
		  which is quite unique, showing another outrage on his property, not included in
		  the warrant. It was superscribed “Chapel Hill,” and is as
		  follows:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="letter">
                  <p>“DEAR SIR:—Having been informed that you are anxious to know why your gate-post was decorated with tar and feathers, this is to inform you that it was intended by the patriotic students to deride Toryism, and as a monument to the memory of the inspired politician and designing traitor.</p>

                </div1>
              </body>
            </text>
          </q>
          <p>This precious morceau of literature proves that the persecution was
		  distinctly in resentment for the supposed leaning to Federalism of the clerical
		  President. The insult is the more pointed because in the direction he is
		  dignified only as “Mr. Robt. Chapman,” ignoring his official and
		  ministerial character.</p>
          <p>In November following the Faculty report that, though during this year
		  they have passed through troublesome times, they have been enabled to stand at
		  their post and maintain the authority of the institution. Some of the persons
		  suspended last session have returned, and, with scarcely an exception, have
		  been orderly. This session has been characterized by order and attention to
		  business, with the exception of some irregularities originating in Steward's
		  Hall, and for which one student was suspended. It is essential to the growing
		  prosperity of the University that further suitable provision be made on this
		  subject (i. e., management of Stewards Hall). With the expectation that the
		  Board will make such provision the Faculty consider the Seminary as in a truly
		  flourishing condition.</p>
          <p>The other outbreak was on September 18, 1816. It injured the
		  reputation of the President still more because the sympathy
		  <pb xml:id="p236" n="236"/>of the public was strongly with the students rather than
		  the Faculty. The following account is substantially correct:</p>
          <p>Wm. Biddle Shepard, a very able member of the Senior class, belonging
		  to an influential family of New Bern, connected with the Donnells, the Blounts,
		  the Bryans, the Pettigrews and others, had some sentences in his oration
		  submitted for correction, of a strong political character favorable to the
		  Republican party. These sentences, the President, exercising a discretion
		  vested in him, cut out and ordered Shepard not to deliver them. This order,
		  when the speech was delivered in public, was disobeyed, whereupon the President
		  promptly commanded him to take his seat. The orator insisted on proceeding with
		  his address. Numbers of the students shouted, “Go on! go on!” The
		  prompter, Wm. Plummer, continued to perform the duty which he had undertaken.
		  Shepard finished his speech in defiance of the President, being vociferously
		  encouraged and applauded. The next day the students had a meeting in the Chapel
		  and passed resolutions upholding the rightfulness of his and their conduct.</p>
          <p>The Faculty acted promptly and sternly. Forty-six of the participants
		  were summoned before them. Shepard was suspended for six months, and also
		  George C. Dromgoole, for being the leader in upholding him. It was a material
		  part of the charge against them, that they declared they were justifiable. The
		  Trustees added the severer sentence of expulsion, declaring that the interest
		  of the University required that the disobedience of which they were guilty
		  should be punished in the most exemplary way. Thomas N. Mann was suspended for
		  six months for participating in the riot, and “refusing to admit his
		  guilt.” Plummer for prompting, applauding and afterwards justifying his
		  conduct, was suspended for four months.</p>
          <p>The punishment of those, who in a public meeting disapproved the
		  action of the Faculty and upheld the conduct of Shepard and his aiders and
		  abettor, was conditional. All who would in writing acknowledge, 1st., that
		  those who applauded Shepard were guilty of gross disorder and disrespect of
		  authority; 2d., that on the next morning they transgressed their duty as
		  students and as good members of society, by proceeding <pb xml:id="p237" n="237"/>
		  with tumultuous noise and riotous behavior to the Public Hall, and uniting in
		  an unlawful and disorderly assembly for the purpose of opposing the Faculty and
		  violating the laws; 3d., that they hoped for forgiveness and solemnly promised
		  faithfully to submit to the laws of the University and deport themselves as
		  orderly members of society. A few refused to sign the paper and were suspended.
		  Among the signers were such orderly students as Wm. M. Green, Wm. D. Moseley,
		  Hugh Waddell, and Hamilton C. Jones.</p>
          <p>Notices of the suspensions were sent to all other colleges.</p>
          <p>In talking with the students of that day after they had become elderly
		  men I derived the impression clearly that the President was generally blamed
		  for his conduct in this matter. It was thought that, even if he concluded that
		  Shepard's act was worthy of severe punishment, he should have allowed him to
		  finish and prosecuted him afterwards. I happen to know that Plummer's father,
		  Kemp Plummer, next year a Trustee, sustained his son. The criticism appears to
		  be just, but certainly the President is not censurable for enforcing a law of
		  the Trustees forbidding political speeches.</p>
          <p>All the actors in this riot achieved success in life. The principal,
		  Shepard, was afterwards a leading lawyer, and member of the State and national
		  Legislatures. Plummer stood high as a lawyer and business man, as Chairman of
		  the County Court of Warren, conducting its business with ability. Mann, after a
		  brilliant beginning as a lawyer, member of the General Assembly and Charge d'
		  Affaires to Guatemala, which position he obtained in the hope of curing the
		  pulmonary consumption, under which he was suffering, passed away in early
		  manhood. The fact has come down to us that Plummer, while unable to see the
		  impropriety of his conduct, was desirous of returning and obtaining his
		  diploma. His father, thinking he had been treated unjustly, refused to allow
		  it. Mosely, Dromgoole, Waddell, Jones, Leak and Green are mentioned
		  hereafter.</p>
          <p>In October, 1816, in revenge doubtless for the action of the Faculty,
		  a forerunner of the modern dynamiters perpetrated a dastardly outrage on one of
		  the Tutors, John Patterson. Wm. M. Green, in a letter to one of the suspended,
		  Martin Armstrong, <pb xml:id="p238" n="238"/>told the story. “While sitting
		  alone a few nights since I was startled by a tremendous report, when on inquiry
		  I found that a brass knob from one of the doors had been filled with powder and
		  placed before Patterson's door with a lighted match at the end of it. While in
		  this state Glascock discovered as he thought a piece of fire dropped by
		  accident and picked up this affair, but immediately dropped it. He had
		  proceeded only a few steps when it exploded, but without injuring him.”
		  It is easy to see that his life, or his eyesight was in imminent danger.</p>
          <p>So far as the discipline extended the Faculty were victorious. Peter
		  O. Picot, of Plymouth, writes to his cousin. Alfred M. Slade, who had been sent
		  home for some fault, in doleful jeremiads: “All quiet here; the students
		  seem to have lost their energy and yield implicitly to the yoke. The storm has
		  blown over, but it has made impressions not easily to be eradicated, for this
		  place looks like some half-deserted village, where you may see its inhabitants
		  collected in small groups, talking over the news of the day, some commiserating
		  your unjust fate, and others pouring out invectives against the Faculty for
		  their palpably erroneous decision and rash suspensions.” * * * The
		  suspension of Shepard, Plummer and Mann * * * was as unjust and unfounded as
		  disgraceful to its authors, who seem to be callous to equity and
		  justice.” In a letter written three weeks afterwards he says:
		  “Never was a place so much altered as this. The Chapel looks destitute.
		  No crowds to hear the news are seen running before a member of the Faculty. All
		  is still! All is quiet! With implicit obedience they bend to the yoke, and
		  undergo with patience the bondage of supercilious domination.” * * *
		  “The poor Philanthropic members are to be pitied for they have but
		  thirteen members.”</p>
          <p>Wm. Mercer Green, from boyhood a model of correct behavior, wrote to
		  his friend, Martin A. B. Armstrong, one of the victims: “All again is
		  quiet; the countenances of our most noble and impartial Faculty are unclouded,
		  and those of the boys marked with contempt. The thought of the near approach of
		  the examination has dispelled all others, and the absence of the suspended, we
		  are only able to call to mind when we look into the vacant rooms.” Then
		  follows an evidence of the tact <pb xml:id="p239" n="239"/>for which Bishop Green
		  was distinguished through life. “I speak of others, my friend; rest
		  assured <hi rend="italics">you</hi>are not forgotten.”</p>
          <p>While the first impulse of the students was to take sides against the
		  Faculty there was a partial reaction. Hamilton C. Jones wrote in the February
		  following the disturbance that “Shepard and Dromgoole are very much
		  censured by all the sober part of the community. Shepard's speech has lost its
		  popularity, and notwithstanding the great puffing of the New Bern editor has
		  been stigmatized by every judge of literary merit as a flowery piece of
		  nonsense.” It should be noted, however, that Jones and Shepard belonged
		  to different societies and feeling between the two was then bitter. In the
		  letter in which the above criticism occurs is found the following: “The
		  Dialectic Society is still in a very flourishing condition. The other
		  (Philanthropic), though increasing in numbers, degenerates in point of
		  talent.” The writer too, though the Federalist party was practically
		  extinct, sympathized with its principles, and afterwards followed Clay into the
		  wigwam of the Whigs, while Shepard continued to be a warm Republican and became
		  a Democratic leader.</p>
          <p>It is altogether probable that this unfortunate trouble led to Dr.
		  Chapman's leaving the institution, for at the meeting of the Board of Trustees
		  next after its occurrence, November 23, 1816, he “in solemn form resigned
		  his office as President of the University.” The words “in solemn
		  form” have an ominous sound. His resignation was certainly associated in
		  the public mind with the disturbance, which political partisans and advocates
		  of free speech declared to be evidence of his incapacity. The letter of
		  resignation dated three days before asserts that his duties had been performed
		  “faithfully and successfully,” and that he was desirous to be more
		  fully devoted to the gospel ministry. He gave notice that his place would be
		  vacant at the close of the year 1817, but the Board accepted the resignation to
		  take effect immediately, agreeing, however, unanimously to pay him one-half
		  year's salary ($800), and to allow him to retain the President's house
		  until the end of the next session. There is a notable absence of praises of his
		  past services and regrets at his departure. Judge Cameron wrote to Judge
		  Murphey on November <pb xml:id="p240" n="240"/>27, 1816, that he was glad Dr.
		  Chapman had resigned—that he wished he had done so twelve months ago.
		  “It would have been much better for himself and the University.” He
		  presumed that Mr. Caldwell and the Committee of Appointments would open an
		  official correspondence with Dr. Neil on the subject of the Presidency, but he
		  sincerely wished that Mr. Caldwell will resume the office himself. Dr. Neil was
		  not again mentioned; probably Dr. Wm. Neill, a Presbyterian clergyman of
		  Philadelphia, President of Dickinson College in 1824-'29, an author.</p>
          <p>The number of students, however, did not indicate any failure in Dr.
		  Chapman's administration. For his term of four years the aggregate was 352,
		  averaging 88 yearly, while for the four preceding years under Caldwell the
		  numbers were 209, averaging 52 per annum. There were 63 graduates of Chapman's
		  term, averaging about sixteen, while for the four preceding years there were
		  24, averaging six per annum. Of course most of the improvement was due to the
		  spread of the desire and the means for attaining higher education. The war
		  evidently stirred up the people. Taking the four years after Chapman left and
		  Caldwell resumed the reins we have 465 students, averaging 116, and 50
		  graduates, averaging 12 1-2 per annum. The next four years showed still better
		  with 640 matriculates, averaging 160, and 119 graduates, averaging 30. The
		  reason for this rapid increase of prosperity will appear hereafter.</p>
          <p>Doubtless, however, Dr. Chapman must have had unpleasant recollections
		  of Chapel Hill. He had a grievous private affliction in the death of a
		  daughter. In the village graveyard is a marble slab, which records that
		  Margaretta Blanch, daughter of Rev. Robert H. and Hannah Chapman, died November
		  25, 1814, in the sixteenth year of her age.</p>
          <p>We have the testimony of Rev. Dr. James E. Morrison, a Tutor under
		  Chapman, that he “introduced a most salutary moral change.” He
		  required the study of the Bible, as a textbook, and was the chief factor in
		  organizing the Presbyterian church at Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The teaching of the Bible probably had a flavor of Calvinism. In 1814
		  we find one class of the University Grammar School <pb xml:id="p241" n="241"/>
		  charged with 20 questions on the Catechism and 21 chapters in a book entitled,
		  “Beauties of the Bible.” Another class had 39, a third 38, and the
		  fourth 77 questions in the Catechism. The Senior class of the same school for
		  entrance into the University were examined on four books of the Aeneid, ten
		  chapters of St. John's Gospel in Greek, and 37 questions in the larger
		  Catechism, well known as that used in the Presbyterian church, issued by the
		  Westminister Assembly.</p>
          <p>Dr. Chapman's degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred by Williams'
		  College, Mass., in 1815. After leaving the University he became pastor of
		  Bethel church in the Shenandoah Valley. In 1823 he had a church near
		  Winchester, Virginia, and then labored for a year or two as a Missionary in the
		  hill country of North Carolina. His next and last charge was at Covington,
		  Kentucky, in 1830. He was chosen to be a member of the General Assembly of the
		  Presbyterian church in 1833, and died at Winchester on his return, June 18,
		  1833, and is there buried. In 1797 he married Hannah Arnette, of Elizabethtown,
		  New Jersey, who died at St. Louis, July 7, 1845. They left seven children, one
		  of whom was Rev. Robert Hett Chapman, D.D., who is buried in the cemetery of
		  the Presbyterian church at Asheville, N. C.</p>
          <p>Of the teachers of the University during his term I have already
		  mentioned Professor Rhea. A sketch of Tutor Hooper will be hereafter given. I
		  find no further mention of John Harper Hinton than that he was Principal of
		  Caswell Academy at Yanceyville in 1818, and probably afterwards. He was a
		  native of Wake County.</p>
          <p>James Morrison, who was Tutor from 1814 to 1817, studied divinity
		  under Dr. Chapman and was ordained by the Orange Presbytery in 1817. He was for
		  a while a teacher in the Raleigh Academy. He was pastor of New Providence
		  church, Rockbridge County, Virginia, from 1819 to 1857. He was born in 1795 and
		  died in 1870. Dr. Charles W. Dabney, once Director of the Experiment Station of
		  North Carolina and State Chemist, then President of the University of
		  Knoxville, and now of the University of Cincinnati, is a grandson of Dr. James
		  Morrison.</p>
          <p>Abner Wentworth Clopton, the Principal of the Grammar
		  <pb xml:id="p242" n="242"/>School, has been heretofore described. He died March 21,
		  1831, praised in a newspaper of the day as an “eminent and devoted member
		  of the Baptist church, and one of the earliest and most efficient promoters of
		  the temperance cause, and was equally attentive to the duties of the society of
		  which he was a member.”</p>
          <p>The University bells of the early period were very inferior. A second
		  was bought in 1813. We are told that this was bought in Fayetteville; it,
		  however, was so inferior that seven years afterwards another was procured. This
		  latter on the procurement of the new was hung in the back yard of Dr.
		  Mitchell's lot to be used when the clapper of the other was stolen or in
		  hiding. About the same time the Trustees gave $50 for the transportation
		  of the organ procured for the University by private contributions. This effort
		  to make worship in the Chapel more attractive was supplemented by authorizing
		  Tutor Hooper to procure shutters and a chandelier for the same.</p>
          <p>On the resignation of Professor Rhea in 1814 the experiment was tried
		  of a “Senior Tutor,” with a salary of $500, authorized to
		  live out of the college buildings and to pay his own board, instead of eating
		  without charge with the students at Commons. At the same time the Committee of
		  Appointments were authorized to abolish Commons and rent out the building if
		  they thought best. The dissatisfaction implied in this resolution resulted
		  doubtless from the rise of prices in consequence of the war. The Committee
		  concluded to add improvements to the building, paying Bennett Parton
		  $456, and to allow an increase of 10 per cent (to $33) in price
		  of board. The Senior Tutor was William Hooper, whose health, always delicate,
		  probably required the superior diet of his mother's table. There were other
		  Tutors, James E. Morrison and Abner Stith, and for part of the time John Harper
		  Hinton. In 1815 the Committee on Salaries reported the salaries to be:</p>

          <p>The Committee were impressed with the policy, as well as the justice
		  of increasing the salaries of the highest officers by contingent perquisites,
		  depending on their industry, activity and zeal. On their recommendation,
		  therefore, the Board appropriated the dividends from the bank stock and
		  one-half of tuition receipts to be paid to all the officers and the other half
		  to increasing the salaries of the President and Professors only, “in
		  acknowledgement of their ability, industry and unwearied diligence, by which it
		  is hoped and expected they will acquit themselves.” This explains why the
		  half of Dr. Chapman's salary was stated on the acceptance of his resignation as
		  $800. The President was authorized also to cut firewood near the field
		  set apart for his use, out of sight of the village. This field was west of the
		  Pittsboro road. In the course of time it was found unprofitable for
		  agricultural purposes, and the Public School Committee was authorized to build
		  a cabin on it for a school house.</p>
          <p>In the following year a singular and ambitious plan was devised, under
		  the appearance of improving the institution, of indirectly increasing the
		  salaries to meet the high prices of the war. The Faculty were authorized to
		  clear out the land to the east of the campus on the roads leading to Raleigh,
		  “so as to command a full view of the distant horizon over Point Prospect
		  (now Piney) to the east.” As there were two roads, one on the summit of
		  the ridge and the other about a hundred yards to the north, this permission
		  included at least twenty acres of good oak and hickory.</p>
          <p>The reply made by the Board to Treasurer Williams' request for a clerk
		  to ascertain balances due prior to his term, shows that they were not
		  indiscriminately generous. They voted that the Treasurer “from long
		  experience and knowledge of the fiscal affairs of the University must be much
		  better qualified to unravel anything mysterious than a clerk.” They
		  thought it his duty to make the investigation and recommended that he
		  “devote <pb xml:id="p244" n="244"/>such portion of his time as will enable
		  him to effect an eclaircisement of the accounts.”</p>
          <p>The Board showed their caution in another ruling. They declined to
		  warrant the title to escheated land sold by them because if the title is good
		  it will not enhance the price as the purchaser is sure to investigate for
		  himself. If the title is doubtful they ought not to warrant.</p>
          <p>One of the old-time “blue laws” was abolished at this
		  meeting. The by-law forbidding students to wear hats in the buildings was
		  repealed, but with the provision that “they shall not wear hats while
		  addressing a member of the Faculty.” An ordinance was likewise adopted
		  that applicants for admission delaying to report more than twenty-four hours
		  after reaching Chapel Hill shall be in danger of being refused.</p>
          <p>During this regime the excuses for absences from Morning Prayers were
		  noted in a book. I copy some of them to show that our grandfathers acted as we
		  do. The answers were “Sick,” “Unwell,” “Was not
		  waked,” “Tardy,” “Indisposed,” “Did not
		  hear the bell,” “Weather bad,” “Asleep.” There is
		  no record of any punishments for non-attendance.</p>
          <p>In 1815 a tardy sale was made of part of the Gerrard lands. The
		  statement shows the trouble experienced in the location and the sale of land
		  warrants in Tennessee, caused partly by carelessness and partly by fraud. Judge
		  Potter and Treasurer Haywood, a majority of the committee, reported that
		  Gerrard's will mentioned 13,000 acres. A memorandum found among his papers
		  shows only 11,364 acres, so it is evident that he sold some after making the
		  will. He gave 640 acres for locating his lands, leaving only 10,724. He
		  requested that his “service right,” 2,560 acres, should not be
		  sold, so deducting these they had 8,164. Of these McKenzie's 640 tract was
		  “land lost,” i. e., could not be found and this must be subtracted,
		  leaving 7,524. The following were also “land lost:”</p>

          <p>Taking off these there were left 4,352 acres. Appraisers appointed by
		  the agent of the Board valued these at $6,363.50. Col. Wm. Polk bought
		  at $6,400, payable one-half cash and the rest when needed to pay for
		  bank stock, which the Board had resolved to buy. As a still further irritation
		  it was discovered after the sale that 428 acres had been leased for several
		  years, so the price of this tract was held up until this matter could be
		  adjusted.</p>
          <p>The General Assembly had made provision for issuing other warrants in
		  the place of “lost lands,” but it took time, trouble and expense to
		  recover them, and in the meantime prices fell and sales were still further
		  delayed.</p>
          <p>It is certain that Dr. Caldwell was sincerely desirous of continuing
		  in his Professorship of Mathematics. He endeavored vigorously to find a
		  successor to Chapman, of sufficient learning and administrative gifts, but in
		  vain. In addition to Dr. Neill, already mentioned, the office was tendered to
		  Rev. Lewis von Schweinitz, D.D., LL.D., of the Moravian church, who in addition
		  to his theological attainments was eminent as a Botanist. Both nominees
		  declined and the strong pressure on Caldwell prevailed.</p>

          <p>The answer of the old school President was likewise in writing. He
		  said, “with diffidence I will accept it, and if I shall ever be found to
		  have gone wrong in discharge of the duties, <pb xml:id="p246" n="246"/>I hope that
		  the members of the Committee and of the Board in general will be ready to make

		  without the intention of evil.”</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred upon him by the
		  University in the same year.</p>
          <p>The Trustees, who accepted Dr. Chapman's resignation, were Wm. Miller,
		  Governor and Chairman; Judge Henry Potter, John Winslow, James Iredell, Calvin
		  Jones, Atlas Jones, Robert Williams (of Raleigh); Henry Seawell, Robert H.
		  Jones, Wm. Polk, Lewis Williams, Simmons J. Baker and A. D. Murphey. Dr.
		  Chapman is also mentioned as present. Most of these were present at the
		  election of Dr. Caldwell on December 17, 1816.</p>
          <p>The Faculty records are singularly deficient during Chapman's
		  administration and for 1817. The following, although incomplete, is accurate, I
		  think:</p>
          <p>The Graduates of 1813 were in number 14. The report of the class
		  standing of the members has been lost. The following attained distinction.
		  William E. Bailey was a Professor of Ancient Languages in the College of
		  Charleston; William S. Blackledge was a Representative in Congress; John H.
		  Hinton and Abner Stith, Tutors in the University of North Carolina and
		  afterwards Classical teachers. William J. Polk was a prominent physician.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates with the class not graduating, Elijah Graves was a
		  Presbyterian preacher and a teacher of repute; Alexander Long, a very popular
		  physician, and Romulus M. Saunders, a Judge, Congressman and Minister to Spain;
		  Robert Williams, State Adjutant-General and Secretary and Treasurer of the
		  University.</p>
          <p>To Rev. Jeremiah Atwater was given the degree of Doctor of Divinity
		  (D. D.)</p>
          <p>The Senior class of 1814, in numbers 16, was of a high grade. Aaron V.
		  Brown was a member of the Tennessee Legislature, Governor, Representative in
		  Congress and Postmaster-General; Charles L. Hinton, a planter, Trustee,
		  Secretary and Treasurer of the University, and State Treasurer; Charles Manly,
		  a Trustee <pb xml:id="p247" n="247"/>of the University 42 years, and Secretary and
		  Treasurer 46 years, Governor of the State; Samuel Pickens, Comptroller of
		  Alabama; James Morrison, a Tutor in this institution and a Presbyterian
		  preacher.</p>
          <p>Of the Graduates of 1815, in numbers 18, some became famous.</p>
          <p>John H. Bryan was elected to Congress and the State Senate at the same
		  time, and chose the first. He was a Trustee of the University 45 years. Robert
		  R. King was a Tutor and then a preacher. Francis L. Hawks, D.D., LL.D., an
		  eminent preacher and author, in early life Reporter of the Supreme Court of N.
		  C.; Edward Hall, Judge of the Superior Court; Willie P. Mangum was a Judge,
		  Senator of the United States and President of the Senate; Mitchell was Clerk of
		  the General Assembly and President of the Bank of Tennessee; Richard Dobbs
		  Spaight was the last Governor elected by the General Assembly.</p>
          <p>The honors are not mentioned in the reports, but tradition gives the
		  highest to Croom, Bryan, Hawks and Spaight.</p>
          <p>We have the exercises of the class of 1815. The Latin Salutatory was
		  spoken by Isaac Croom, the Mathematical Oration by Richard Dobbs Spaight. There
		  was a “Forensic Dispute,” anticipatory of the Know Nothing Party,
		  “Whether Civil Offices should be open to Foreigners?” Matthew
		  McClung opened as “Respondent,” Henry L. Plummer, called the
		  Opponent, replied, and Hugh M. Stokes closed as Replicator. Another Forensic
		  Dispute was “Whether Theatrical Amusements are Beneficial?” between
		  Robert Hinton, Respondent, Semuel D. Hatch, Opponent, and Robert King,
		  Replicator. A third dispute was between Priestly Mangum, Stephen Sneed and
		  Edward Hill, the subject being “Should a Penitentiary be immediately
		  erected?” This was followed by an oration on Natural Philosophy, by
		  Stokely D. Mitchell, of Tennessee. In the afternoon there was the English
		  Salutatory by John H. Bryan, followed by a three-handed dispute as to whether
		  students should be subject to Military Duty, a theme which became very acute
		  during our Civil War. The Respondent was Matthew Moore, the Opponent James
		  Hooper, the Replicator George F. Graham. Francis L. Hawks closed with the
		  Valedictory. His oratorical gifts were even then widely known and warmly
		  admired.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p248" n="248"/>
          <p>The other speakers at this Commencement were:</p>
          <p>“Should the United States assist the South American Republics
		  against Spain and the Holy Alliance?”, by Broomfield L. Ridley.</p>
          <p>“The Character of the North American Indians,” by James H.

          <p>“Should the American Colonization Society receive the patronage
		  of the Public,” Robert H. Booth.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on Rev. Levi
		  Holbrook.</p>
          <p>Mr. Francis L. Hawks, who had received the degree of Master of Arts
		  from Yale College, was awarded the <hi rend="italics">ad eundem</hi>degree
		  from this University.</p>
          <p>Of the 16 Graduates of the class of 1816, those most notable were:
		  William Julius Alexander, a Trustee, member of the Legislature, Speaker of the
		  House and Solicitor of his district; Thomas J. Haywood, Judge in Tennessee;
		  John DeRosset, physician of great promise, dying young; Charles Applewhite
		  Hill, who left the University in 1804, Principal of Classical schools, preacher
		  and State Senator; John Patterson, Tutor U. N. C. and preacher; James W.
		  McClung, Speaker of the House of Tennessee; John Y. Mason, LL.D.,
		  Attorney-General of the United States, a Judge in Virginia, Secretary of the
		  Navy and Minister to France.</p>
          <p>It was at this Commencement that the degree of Doctor of Divinity was
		  conferred on Rev. Joseph Caldwell, the newly elected President.</p>
          <p>There were eleven of the Graduates of 1817. The most eminent was John
		  M. Morehead, a strong lawyer, Governor of the <pb xml:id="p249" n="249"/>State,
		  President and chief promoter of the North Carolina and other railroads, a chief
		  factor in the industrial development of the State, an active Trustee of the
		  University for 38 years, member of the Confederate Congress. Holt was a
		  physician, but especially distinguished as the pioneer in the introduction of
		  blooded stock. He was the first President of the State Agricultural
		  Society.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, Bedford Brown was a member of the Conventions of
		  1835 and 1861, President of the State Senate, United States Senator; David F.
		  Caldwell, Speaker of the State Senate, Judge and President of a bank; William
		  B. Shepard, member of the State Senate and of Congress; John G. A. Williamson,
		  member of the Legislature, Consul to Venezuela, Charge' d' affairs at
		  Caraccas.</p>
          <p>For the term ending in June, the second half of the session, the
		  strange spectacle was presented of a University without a Professor, Dr.
		  Caldwell and his Tutors caring for the institution. They were William Hooper,
		  Principal Tutor, William D. Moseley and Robert Rufus King, followed in the
		  autumn by John Motley Morehead and Priestly H. Mangum. Moseley some years
		  afterwards obtained double compensation on the ground that King was forced to
		  resign on account of his unpopularity with the students in the fall of 1817,
		  and double duties were devolved on him. He and President Caldwell were the
		  entire Faculty until Professor Mitchell began work in February, 1818.</p>
          <p>The Trustees concluded that the Principal Tutor, Wm. Hooper, whose
		  learning and teaching power were admitted, should be elevated to the Chair of
		  Ancient Languages. This was done and the office of Principal Tutor was
		  abolished never to be restored. The salary of the Professor of Ancient
		  Languages was fixed at $800 per annum. At the same time tuition was
		  raised to $30 per annum.</p>
          <p>The Tutors of this period were men of power. Morehead and Moseley are
		  described elsewhere. Priestly Mangum, brother of the more eminent Willie P.
		  Mangum, was a useful citizen and a safe lawyer, for years Solicitor of the
		  county of Orange, and also a Commoner in the Legislature. Robert Rufus King
		  <pb xml:id="p250" n="250"/>was a Presbyterian minister of promise, called by death
		  from his work in 1822. But it was impossible for young men, however able, to
		  have proper restraining influence among 108 youths, unaccustomed to discipline.
		  We have glimpses of wild deeds in this year. So incensed were the Trustees that
		  they instructed the President to invoke the aid of the criminal law to punish
		  the perpetrators of outrages on the buildings and grove in the fall of
		  1817.</p>

          <head>MITCHELL, OLMSTEAD AND KOLLOCK, PROFESSORS.</head>
          <p>The Committee of Appointments reported to the Board in November that
		  they had selected for the Chair of Chemistry Denison Olmstead, a graduate of
		  Yale, and had allowed him a year's study there before coming to the University.
		  For the Chair of Mathematics, made vacant by the elevation of Dr. Caldwell,
		  they had searched in vain in many directions for a suitable man, but, not
		  discouraged, they had at length found Mr. Elisha Mitchell, of Connecticut, who
		  had accepted their offer.</p>
          <p>The choice was exceedingly fortunate as the newcomer was not only
		  accomplished and able, but was resolved, like his President, to live and die
		  among us. He was born August 19, 1793, and was, therefore, 24 years old. His
		  native place was Washington, Litchfield County, Connecticut. His father was a
		  farmer, Abner by name; his mother Phoebe Eliot, a lineal descendant of John
		  Eliot, the Apostle to the Indians, whose Bible translated into their language
		  is one of the famous books of the world. From her grandfather, Rev. Jared
		  Eliot, M.D. and D.D., one of the most noted American savants of his day, he
		  inherited his fondness for Natural Philosophy, Botany and Mineralogy. He was
		  prepared for Yale College by Rev. Azel Bachus, a noted teacher, afterwards
		  President of Hamilton College.</p>
          <p>At Yale he graduated in 1813, one of the best scholars in his class.
		  Among his class-mates were Denison Olmsted, destined to be his colleague; James
		  Longstreet, author of Georgia Scenes and President of the University of
		  Mississippi; Rev. George Singletary, an influential Episcopal clergyman; Thomas
		  P. Devereux, an able lawyer and Reporter of our Supreme <pb xml:id="p251" n="251"/>
		  Court; and George E. Badger, an eminent Senator and Secretary of the Navy, who
		  did not graduate.</p>
          <p>After leaving Yale young Mitchell taught in the academy of Dr.
		  Eigenbrodt at Jamaica, on Long Island. In 1815 we find him in charge of a
		  school for girls in New London. The next year he was appointed a Tutor in his
		  college, where he discharged his duties so faithfully and well that the
		  Chaplain of the Senate of the United States, a son of President Dwight, of
		  Yale, recommended him to Wm. Gaston, then a Representative in Congress from
		  North Carolina and a Trustee of its University, as learned in Mathematics, as a
		  cultured man of letters generally and as skillful in teaching.</p>
          <p>On notification of his appointment Mr. Mitchell spent a few weeks at
		  the Theological Seminary in Andover, Massachusetts, receiving a license to
		  preach as a Congregational minister. He reached Chapel Hill on the 31st of
		  January, 1818, and at once entered on his nearly forty years' service, with the
		  intelligence, zeal and success for which he was distinguished. He was ordained
		  a minister in the Presbyterian church in 1821.</p>
          <p>In the fall of 1819 young Mitchell went back to Connecticut in order
		  to take to himself a wife. His bride was handsome, intellectual and well
		  educated, Maria S. North, daughter of a physician of New London. Mrs. Spencer
		  in the University Magazine of October, 1884, gives extracts from letters from
		  her after her arrival at Chapel Hill. The first is dated January 1, 1820. I
		  abridge the narrative. It shows vividly the discomforts of old-time traveling.
		  They started from New York Monday before Christmas, 1819, and journeyed by boat
		  to Elizabeth-town, thence by stage to Trenton; thence by stage to Philadelphia,
		  stopping a day to visit Peale's Museum, West's picture and the Academy of Fine
		  Arts. Thence they took boat down the Delaware to New Castle; thence traveled by
		  stage to Frenchtown, where they again took a steamer, and after a moonlight
		  trip reached Baltimore by sunrise on Thursday. There they had time to visit the
		  Roman Catholic Cathedral and other places. After breakfast they boarded the
		  steamer, United States, for Norfolk, starting at 9 o'clock. They had a
		  delightful trip, the day being pleasant. One of their traveling companions
		  <pb xml:id="p252" n="252"/>was Dr. Simmons J. Baker, whom they describe as a man of
		  liberal education, very lively and intelligent in his conversation—a
		  Trustee of the University. “He sets a higher value on the
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">amor patriae</foreign></hi>than any man
		  I've ever known.” They reached Norfolk at 1 o'clock on Friday. As the
		  stage was waiting they missed their dinner and speeded to the head of Dismal
		  Swamp, eleven miles. Here they entered a canal boat 20 feet in length. “
		  'Twas sunset of a rainy Christmas eve when we entered this boat and were drawn
		  along for 22 miles at the rate of four miles an hour.” It was suggested
		  that as Christmas was a holiday for slaves and many runaways were living in the
		  swamp, firearms might be needed; so the gentlemen prepared their pistols, three
		  in number for possible robbers. The five locks and three bridges impeded their
		  progress so that they did not get through the swamp until 10 o'clock at night.
		  The driver of the stage for passengers had been restive and gone off, so a
		  one-horse gig and a one-horse cart for baggage were procured, and they made
		  their way to a country tavern not far off, where they spent the night, sending
		  to Elizabeth City for the stage to return for them. They ate breakfast in that
		  town and dined in Edenton Saturday afternoon. As the steamboat for Plymouth was
		  gone, in an open boat rowed by four men, over a rough sea, one of the
		  passengers bailing out the water which poured through the gaping seams, the
		  travelers in seven hours reached Plymouth. Here their first care was to unpack
		  their trunks and dry their soaked clothes. They then proceeded by stage by way
		  of Williamston and Tarboro to Raleigh, only to find that the stage to Chapel
		  Hill had departed. They hired a special conveyance, whose driver was suspected
		  of being a murderer, and the Professor thought it wise to hint that he was
		  provided with firearms. After a day's ride through a country almost uninhabited
		  the bride reached her new home December 29th, and her husband preached his
		  first sermon on the following Sunday in the old Chapel or Person Hall.</p>
          <p>For a while they boarded with Prof. Olmsted at the house built for the
		  President, that nearest to the University buildings on the west, paying
		  $288 a year for board, lodging and washing. Their host kept four
		  servants besides the washerwoman. <pb xml:id="p253" n="253"/>He had a wife and a
		  son and, although a Connecticut man, paid $350 for a slave girl as a
		  nurse to the youngster. Their household expenses were $1,000 a year.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Mitchell expressed much admiration for the Doctor and Mrs.
		  Caldwell. She spoke of the lady as being sociable and friendly. They gave a
		  dinner party in honor of the newcomers, a handsome dinner, handsomely served.
		  The bride had the honor of drinking the first glass of wine with Dr. Caldwell,
		  the sentiment being, “To Absent Friends.” Womanlike she tells her
		  mother of what a Carolina dinner consisted: “Roast turkey with duck,
		  roast beef and broiled, broiled chicken, Irish and sweet potatoes, turnips,
		  rice, carrots, parsnips, cabbage, stewed apples, boiled pudding, baked potato
		  pudding, damson tarts, current tarts, apple pies and whips.”</p>
          <p>She was pleased with her new surroundings, notwithstanding the two
		  hundred curious eyes of the students when she was in the Chapel. She praises
		  particularly the fine apples and abundance of them. Thirty years afterwards the
		  neighborhood was equally distinguished for peaches. The orchards have been
		  allowed to go to decay. She whiles away the hours when her husband is absent,
		  by study, reciting to him at night. She asks her mother to send her some fine
		  thread, worsted yarn and some needles, the package to be forwarded to New York
		  in order to come in the next box of books. Fine materials for ladies work were
		  not procurable at Chapel Hill in those days. It was not long before Dr. Olmsted
		  bought himself a residence and the young couple started housekeeping in the
		  home he vacated, which they occupied for thirty-seven years.</p>
          <p>At the same session the Committee on Buildings were authorized to
		  erect a building embracing recitation rooms whenever the funds would allow.</p>
          <p>The vision of golden streams to flow from the escheated warrants of
		  Tennessee emboldened the Trustees in 1818, with only one dissenting voice, to
		  add the Professorship of Rhetoric and Logic and adjunct Professorship of Moral
		  Philosophy. Rev. Shepard Kosciusko Kollock was chosen to fill the chair of
		  Rhetoric and began at the same term with Olmsted, the fall term of 1819. His
		  salary was $1,240. The President held the Chair <pb xml:id="p254" n="254"/>
		  of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics. The Tutors were King and Simon Jordan. The
		  number of students during the year was 118.</p>
          <p>Dr. Kollock was born in Elizabethtown, New Jersey, June 25, 1795. His
		  father, Shepard Kollock, was an officer in the Revolutionary Army, and hence
		  delighted to honor the Polish patriot. The son graduated with high honors at
		  Princeton at the age of sixteen. He began the study of Theology under his
		  brother-in-law, Rev. John McDowell, D.D., and finished his course under his
		  brother, Rev. Henry Kollock, D.D., whose ministerial work was at Savannah,
		  Georgia. His first charge after ordination was that of the Presbyterian church
		  at Oxford, North Carolina, marrying during his first year, 1818, Miss Sarah
		  Blount Littlejohn, daughter of Thomas Blount Littlejohn. Coming to the
		  University in 1819, he remained until 1825, when he accepted a call to the
		  Presbyterian church of Norfolk, Virginia, where he remained about ten years. He
		  then removed to New Jersey, and was for three years the successful agent of the
		  Board of Missions, after which he was pastor successively in Burlington and
		  Greenwich, both in New Jersey. In 1860 his health failed and he accepted light
		  work in connection with a charitable institution in Philadelphia. He died April
		  7, 1865.</p>
          <p>Dr. Kollock married a second time—Miss Sarah Harris, of Norfolk.
		  Several children and more grandchildren of this marriage survive. A child,
		  Sarah, of the first marriage, was one of the highly esteemed principals of the
		  excellent School for Females of the Misses Nash and Miss Kollock. The Misses
		  Nash are daughters of a sister of Professor Kollock, wife of Chief Justice
		  Frederick Nash.</p>
          <p>The election of Prof. Kollock caused an outcry against President
		  Caldwell for filling the Faculty with Presbyterian preachers. This he
		  emphatically denied in a letter to Treasurer Haywood, calling attention to the
		  fact that Prof. Hooper was an Episcopalian, and making the rather odd statement
		  that he would have been nominated to the Chair of Rhetoric and Logic if he had
		  been ordained as a preacher and could have rendered to him as much relief in
		  the pulpit as Mr. Kollock. Moreover, <pb xml:id="p255" n="255"/>he contended that
		  the best man should be selected regardless of denominational bias. It should be
		  noticed too that Olmsted, howbeit a Presbyterian, although he studied Theology,
		  was not licensed to preach. A letter from Treasurer Haywood to Judge Murphey of
		  the date of April 26, 1819, shows that the President was so chagrined at the
		  postponement by the Board of his nomination, that he hinted at accepting a
		  Professorship in the South Carolina College. It is stated that the hesitation
		  arose from the fear that this placing the religious instruction in the charge
		  of two Presbyterian ministers might be against the Constitution, as exalting
		  one denomination over the others. It is notable that Treasurer Haywood stated
		  that he and Colonel Wm. Polk, adherents of the Protestant Episcopal church,
		  were of the opinion that it was imprudent to elect one of their own faith, for
		  fear of giving offence to other denominations. As Professor Hooper was then an
		  Episcopalian, one other of the same faith would have been a too heavy weight to
		  be carried by the struggling institution. This seems to prove that the
		  prejudice from the old hostility to the Church of England, allied with the
		  odious Colonial government, still lingered among our people. After Kollock's
		  election the Faculty stood, Caldwell, Mitchell, Olmsted, Kollock, four to one
		  Episcopalian, <hi rend="italics">tottering towards the Baptists.</hi>As the
		  Tutors changed almost yearly, I have not inquired into their religious
		  proclivities.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE ENLARGED CURRICULUM.</head>
          <p>The scheme of studies was of course considerably changed by the
		  addition of the two new Professorships. For admission into the Freshman class
		  the following was prescribed:</p>
          <p>In Latin—The Grammar; Prosody; Corderius; 25 of Aesop's Fables;
		  <foreign xml:lang="lat">Selectæ Veteræ</foreign>, or
		  <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sacra Historia</foreign>; Cornelius Nepos or
		  <foreign xml:lang="lat">Viri Romae</foreign>; Mair's Introduction; Seven Books of
		  Cæsar's Commentaries; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ovidi Editio
		  Expurgata</foreign>; The Bucolics and Six Books of Aeneid in Virgil.</p>
          <p>In Greek—Greek Grammar; St. John's Gospel and The Acts of the
		  Apostles; Graeca Minora to Lucian's Dialogues.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable that neither Arithmetic nor Algebra is in this
		  list.</p>
          <p>The Plan of Education in the University was as follows:</p>
          <pb xml:id="p256" n="256"/>
          <p><hi rend="italics">For the Freshman Class</hi>—</p>
          <p>In Latin—The whole of Sallust; Roman Antiquities; the Georgics
		  of Virgil; Cicero's Orations; Ancient Geography.</p>
          <p>In Greek—Graeca Minora continued; first volume of Graeca Majora;
		  Antiquities. (The last included other ancient nations besides Greece.) Ancient
		  Geography.</p>
          <p>In Mathematics—Arithmetic; Algebra.</p>
          <p>In English, etc., Modern Geography; English Grammar, Composition;
		  Declamations; Theses.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">For the Sophomore Class</hi>—</p>
          <p>In Latin—Horace entire.</p>
          <p>In Greek—Graeca Majora continued, First Volume; four books of
		  Homer's Iliad.</p>
          <p>In Mathematics—Algebra concluded; Geometry.</p>
          <p>In English—Geography, Theses, Composition, Declamation.
		  <hi rend="italics">For the Junior Class, then called Junior
		  Sophisters</hi>—</p>
          <p>Latin and Greek were both dropped.</p>
          <p>In Mathematics—Logarithms; Plane Trigonometry; Mensuration of
		  Heights and Distances; Surveying; Spherical Trigonometry; Navigation; Conic
		  Sections, Fluxions.</p>
          <p>Natural Philosophy.</p>
          <p>In English—Classics, Composition, Declamation.</p>
          <p>It is observable that in the catalogue Conics is spelled Conicks, and
		  means of course Analytical Geometry. Fluxions is now called Calculus; Natural
		  Philosophy is called Physics; Classics (spelled Classicks), meant the writings
		  of great English authors, principally of Queen Anne's time.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">For the Senior Class, then called Senior
		  Sophisters</hi>—</p>
          <p>No Latin, Greek or Pure Mathematics.</p>
          <p>In Natural Science—Chemistry; Mineralogy; Geology; Philosophy of
		  Natural History.</p>
          <p>In Applied Mathematics—Natural Philosophy; Progress of the
		  Mathematical and Physical Sciences; Astronomy; Chronology.</p>
          <p>In Philosophy—Moral Philosophy; Progress of Metaphysical,
		  Ethical and Political Philosophy; Metaphysics.</p>
          <p>In English—Logic; Rhetoric; Classics; Composition;
		  Declamation.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p257" n="257"/>
          <p>The students had no laboratory work, but the Professor performed
		  experiments in Chemistry and Physics in the presence of the class. Much
		  attention was paid to composition and declamation, which was supplemented by
		  similar work, enforced by fines, in the two literary societies. The Alumni of
		  the University were therefore easily among the leaders in political life, and
		  had a good start in the professions of law and theology.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>JUDGE MURPHEY'S PLAN.</head>
          <p>It is interesting to compare the foregoing scheme of studies with the
		  plan of Judge Archibald Murphey, who distinguished himself about this time by a
		  very able report on Public Education, and was a man of large experience at the
		  bar, on the bench, and in the General Assembly, and had professional experience
		  in the University. He moved for a committee to report “a revised plan of
		  Education,” embodying “changes suited to the present improved state
		  of science and general knowledge;” also to report a plan of new
		  buildings. The following is the scheme, recommended but not adopted. It is
		  analogous to our modern system of “Schools” or
		  “Colleges,” the term classes, however, being used:</p>
          <p>1. <hi rend="italics">Class of Languages,</hi>embracing Greek and
		  Latin; Murray's English Grammar; Elements of Chronology; Millot's Elements of
		  History; Blair's Lectures.</p>
          <p>2. <hi rend="italics">Class of Mathematics.</hi>—Pure
		  Mathematics up to Fluxions; Mensuration up to Astronomy; Geography.</p>
          <p>3. <hi rend="italics">Physical Sciences.</hi>—Embracing
		  Chemistry, Mineralogy, Geology, Philosophy of Natural History; History of the
		  Progress of Mathematics and Physical Sciences.</p>
          <p>4. <hi rend="italics">Class of the Moral and Political Sciences,</hi>
		  embracing Philosophy of the Human Mind; Ethics and Practical Morality; Elements
		  of Theology; History of the Progress of Ethical and Moral Sciences; Political
		  Philosophy by Paley; Constitution of the United States by Publius; Political
		  Economy by Genith.</p>
          <p>It is very notable that the distinguished Judge did not include in his
		  programme the study of the great sciences, Electricity or Magnetism; nor is
		  there mention of Mechanics, Biology and similar branches now so much
		  cultivated.</p>

          <pb xml:id="p258" n="258"/>
          <head>PRESIDENT POLK'S CLASS.</head>
          <p>The class of 1818 numbered 14.</p>
          <p>The highest honor was conferred on James Knox Polk, afterwards
		  President of the United States, having previously passed through the offices of
		  Governor of Tennessee and Speaker of the House of Representatives.</p>
          <p>The second honor was won by William Mercer Green, afterwards a
		  Professor in our University, Bishop of Mississippi and Chancellor of the
		  University of the South, Doctor of Divinity and of Laws. The third honor
		  devolved on Robert Hall Morrison, afterwards a Doctor of Divinity in the
		  Presbyterian church and President of Davidson College. The fourth honor fell to
		  Hamilton C. Jones, a prominent editor and lawyer of Salisbury and Reporter of
		  the Supreme Court. Besides these, were Hugh Waddell, able lawyer and President
		  of the State Senate, Edward Jones Mallett, Paymaster-General U. S. A. and
		  Consul-General to Italy, and William Dunn Moseley, Speaker of the State Senate
		  and Governor of Florida. The Faculty reported that the class was especially
		  approved on account of the regular, moral and exemplary deportment of its
		  members. Polk never missed a duty while in the institution.</p>
          <p>Associated with these, but not remaining to take degrees, were George
		  C. Dromgoole, Speaker of the Virginia Senate and Representative in Congress, a
		  noted stump speaker.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Divinity was granted to Rev. John McDowell, of
		  Virginia, and that of Master of Arts to Thomas Pollock Devereux, of North
		  Carolina. Dr. McDowell was of New Jersey, for fifty years Trustee of Princeton
		  College, and was efficient as agent in collecting funds for its advancement.
		  Mr. Devereux, a descendant of Jonathan Edwards, was a Trustee of the University
		  of North Carolina, and Reporter of the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p>For the Commencement of 1819 the representatives from the Dialectic
		  Society were Wm. Hill Jordan, of Bertie, Thomas H. Wright, of Wilmington, and
		  Lucius C. Polk, of Raleigh, afterwards of Tennessee. On the part of the
		  Philanthropic Society were Wm. H. Hardin, of Rockingham, afterwards of
		  Fayetteville, Tucker Carrington, of Virginia, and Matthias B. D.
		  <pb xml:id="p259" n="259"/>Palmer, of Northampton County. The Debaters were Thomas
		  B. Slade and Anderson W. Mitchell. The question was “Ought foreigners to
		  be admitted to public offices in the United States?” Three men attained
		  the first distinction, being declared equal. They were Walker Anderson, Clement
		  Carrington Read and Wm. Henry Haywood. Anderson had the Latin Salutatory, Read
		  the English Salutatory, and Haywood the Valedictory.</p>
          <p>Besides the above, Thomas B. Slade, John M. Starke and Paul A.
		  Haralson were appointed by the Faculty to speak a humorous dialogue.</p>
          <p>The success in after-life of the honored men corresponded to their
		  college careers. Anderson, who was slightly superior to Haywood was a Professor
		  in the University and Chief Justice of Florida. Haywood was a leader of the bar
		  and United States Senator. Read was a banker of very high standing. Of the
		  others, Simon P. Jordan was a Tutor in this institution and then a physician;
		  James Turner Morehead, a sound lawyer and member of Congress.</p>
          <p>Contemporaries, not graduating, were John Lancaster Bailey, of the
		  Convention of 1835, and Judge of the Superior Courts; W. F. Leak, Presidential
		  Elector and member of the Conventions of 1835 and 1861. Thomas N. Mann,
		  heretofore mentioned; Alfred M. Slade, Consul to Buenos Ayres; and Mason L.
		  Wiggins, State Senator. Rev. Wm. McPheeters, who had gained fame as a preacher
		  and head of the Raleigh Academy, a Trustee of the University, was made Doctor
		  of Divinity.</p>

          <head>UNIVERSITY LIFE, 1813-'20—LETTERS OF STUDENTS.</head>
          <p>I am fortunately able to give information of interest with respect to
		  this decade of University history, derived from letters by students. Bryan
		  Grimes writes to his mother in January and April, 1813, regretting his
		  inability to visit her during the approaching vacation because of the
		  impossibility of hiring a horse. He requests one or two waistcoats to be sent
		  him at the next session. He is inconvenienced by having only three pair of
		  summer stockings, because the washerwoman brings in clothes weekly and,
		  therefore, he must every alternate week wear a pair for seven days without
		  change. All things seem <pb xml:id="p260" n="260"/>to proceed in harmony in
		  college. The students are exerting themselves for examinations, having no time
		  for sport. He reminds his mother that she had promised to write every month,
		  and he begs her to continue this frequency. He asks her to excuse his
		  penmanship because he has no knife wherewith to mend his bad pen.</p>
          <p>He testifies that he was received with great politeness, which
		  indicates that the evil practice of hazing did not then afflict the
		  institution. Before applying for admission into the Junior class he spent
		  several days in assiduously reviewing Arithmetic, his passing on the Freshman
		  and Sophomore studies not dispensing with this branch. Mr. Grimes proved to be
		  a good student, but did not remain to graduate. He was in after-life a very
		  influential and wealthy planter—a most worthy citizen.</p>
          <p>In October, 1816, Peter C. Picot gives the history of a fight in which
		  two students were involved. James R. Chalmers and Thomas G. Coleman were among
		  those suspended for the Shepard riot. They concluded to sojourn at Hillsboro. A
		  citizen of that town volunteered to reflect severely on the conduct of the
		  students, for which Chalmers kicked him out of doors. In the progress of the
		  fight Coleman, whose nickname was Cub, was severely choked. The offenders were
		  about to be consigned to prison when Judge Thomas Ruffin, a Trustee of the
		  University, appeared and settled the whole matter by a compromise. The
		  adversary of Chalmers declined to prosecute him, on condition that the student,
		  Coleman, should let the choker go free, a curious example of the doctrine of
		  set-off.</p>
          <p>Picot gives a pathetic story of Chapel Hill life. “The beautiful
		  and accomplished Miss P.'s father is no more. Though the world will not grieve,
		  nor has society to lament, for he was to the former a burden and to the latter
		  a disgrace, yet a helpless girl, in the dawn of youth, has to mourn a disgraced
		  father, for he died in jail and laid there some time, until they sent to the
		  Governor to obtain leave to take him out. Oh! if you could have heard her
		  shrieks and witnessed her lamentations it would have pierced your heart and
		  rent your soul. But she has got pacified, and I had the inexpressible pleasure
		  of accompanying her last Thursday evening to preaching.” The subsequent
		  history <pb xml:id="p261" n="261"/>of this consoled inconsolable damsel I have not
		  been able to trace.</p>
          <p>Martin W. B. Armstrong writes on January 31, 1818, for money on
		  account of unexpected expenses. He was one of a committee selected to choose
		  toasts for a dinner to be given on the “birthday of our political
		  father,” and was bound therefore to subscribe for the dinner.
		  “According to custom the Committee had to treat those from whom they
		  received the distinction.” He was also with five others chosen as a
		  manager of the ball to be given to the graduates at Commencement. For this
		  honor he was “again forced to be at the expense of making college
		  drunk.” He estimates the cost at two or three dollars. He regrets the
		  expense for suitable clothes, which according to an account sent his father
		  cost $56. He presses for more clothing for daily use. Cambric shirts are
		  soon gone when they become crazy and old, and he requests that his mother will
		  make him others. His cassimere pantaloons are worn through on the seat and are
		  thin on the knees, and his only other pair requires washing after one week's
		  wearing. “It will not be improper,” he adds, “to provide for
		  another supply.”</p>
          <p>Hamilton C. Jones wrote in the same year to Major Abraham Staples that
		  the business of the Dialectic Society had been conducted with order since the
		  repeal of the law compelling members to attend prayers, which had caused great
		  disturbance. He praises in the highest terms the President, Samuel T. Hauser,
		  of Stokes. The next question for debate was “Do we experience more
		  pleasure in contemplating the works of Nature or of Art?” Jones was to
		  advocate the claims of Nature, saying among other arguments “because no
		  painter nor no sculpturer can produce in the mind of man the exquisite
		  sensation produced in the mind of the lover from contemplating the fascinating
		  charms of his Dulcinea.” He has many other arguments but this
		  preponderates. We must presume that his adversary contended stoutly that the
		  modern fine lady is in a large degree the work of Art and made some allusion to
		  the known fact that Jones was desperately in love with a fair one in the
		  village, whom he afterwards married. Miss Eliza Henderson.</p>
          <p>As the notion was lodged in the public mind that Dr. Chapman failed as
		  a disciplinarian, the disorders of September, 1818, <pb xml:id="p262" n="262"/>must
		  have been of some consolation to his friends. They heard of three students,
		  after loading up with corn whiskey, tumultuously shouting on the streets of the
		  village, breaking into a kitchen, beating a negro, and insulting his owner and
		  family with loud vociferations. On the same day another threw stones at a
		  dwelling. On the same day, being God's holy day, two others were drunken and
		  noisy in the street. All but the stone-thrower were suspended for four months,
		  though they might have escaped as the stone-hurler did by submitting to public
		  admonition in the Chapel. At the time of these rowdy occurrences S. H. was
		  admonished for being deficient in scholarship, often absent from his room and
		  strongly suspected of participation in frequent explosions of gunpowder, and A.
		  W. “after repeated warnings was dismissed for negligence of
		  studies.”</p>
          <p>We learn from a letter of James R. Chalmers, written in 1818 to Alfred
		  M. Slade, that besides being suspended for participation in the street riots,
		  one J. B. was charged with assisting in transporting to the third story of the
		  South Building a large stone or other hard substance, with the intent to injure
		  said building. President Caldwell swore out a warrant against him and he was
		  keeping in hiding, attempting to collect evidence of his innocence. Slade was
		  urged to write a letter avowing J. B.'s guiltlessness that “he may clear
		  himself in the eyes of the Faculty, the Trustees and the world.”</p>
          <p>In the next month a too lively Virginian was charged with the
		  following offences:</p>
          <p>1st. Torturing animals with spirits of turpentine. Doubtless this was
		  the primeval joke of attaching rags saturated with the flaming fluid to the
		  tail of an innocent canine, not with Sampson's motive of revenge on the
		  hereditary enemies of his country, but for cruel delight over the antics of a
		  frightened and tortured beast.</p>
          <p>2d. With lying.</p>
          <p>3d. With slandering the Faculty.</p>
          <p>4th. With threatening physical violence to a member of the
		  Faculty.</p>
          <p>5th. With writing scurrilous and abusive stuff on the Chapel walls
		  about the same.</p>
          <p>6th. With drawing a dirk on a student.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p263" n="263"/>
          <p>The Faculty gravely came to the conclusion that the offender was
		  “not of a proper disposition to be an orderly student,” and sent
		  him home.</p>
          <p>Three months afterwards, on the glorious 22d of February, Walker
		  Anderson delivered an oration, after which a dinner was given in honor of the
		  stately and dignified George Washington, with whom temperance and decorum were
		  life-long habits. The chronicle says that many were intoxicated. Deadly
		  weapons, dirks and pistols were drawn. Tu. C. and Th. C. had a furious fight.
		  Tu. C. drew a dirk. A. I., a peace-maker, in parting them was stabbed in the
		  arm. M. H. used a pistol in a dangerous manner in the crowd and J. S. took it
		  from him.</p>
          <p>There seems to have been no punishment of these offences other than
		  signing pledges. The students were called on to surrender their deadly weapons,
		  to be retained while they were members of the University. Six pistols and two
		  dirks were obtained.</p>
          <p>The trials of the eventful year were not yet over. The whole
		  “establishment,” as the University was often called, was convulsed
		  by a conflict between a student and a member of the Faculty. We have a vivid
		  description of it by Thomas B. Slade, in a letter to his brother. I condense
		  his story. The member of the Faculty was Tutor Simon Jordan, and the student
		  Wm. Anthony, of Virginia.</p>
          <p>There was “a woman in it.” “Both escorted Miss Betsy
		  Puckett one Sunday to Mount Carmel, four miles from town, on the road to
		  Pittsboro. Anthony alleged that Jordan insulted him repeatedly on the journey.
		  Vowing revenge he tendered his resignation as a student, which the Faculty
		  declined to accept. Claiming to be of age, and therefore that he had the right
		  to withdraw, he armed himself with three pistols, a dirk and a club, and
		  attacked Jordan, who was walking with R. R. King, the other Tutor. A crowd
		  collecting, they were separated without damage. Anthony was summoned before the
		  Faculty, where it was proved that he had called the President a liar. He again
		  afterwards armed as before, attacked Jordan, who had a small walking cane. A
		  few blows with the sticks were exchanged, when Jordan, finding his weapon too
		  light in comparison <pb xml:id="p264" n="264"/>with his adversary's, dropped it and
		  caught Anthony in such manner as to render his club useless.” I give the
		  conclusion in the words of Slade, who was a witness, as they throw light on the
		  frame of mind of the students generally. “They now commenced a fight
		  which created much interest among the students, for the ‘Dis’ were
		  warm for Simon Jordan, Anthony being a member of the ‘Phi’ Society.
		  It was held with equal success by both parties for a few moments, when King
		  called upon me, as I was nearest, to part them. With his assistance we parted
		  them. I leaped for joy on its termination, for the victory, as far as the fight
		  was carried, was given to Simon, both by his enemies and friends. Of the two
		  combatants Anthony is much the larger, but Simon much the more active.”
		  Anthony still vowed revenge, but a warrant was sworn out for his arrest and he
		  deemed it prudent to leave the county.</p>
          <p>About the same time James R. Chalmers, heretofore mentioned, gave a
		  student who had left the University and returned to attend to some business, a
		  most unmerciful whipping. The cause of the exasperation of the castigator is
		  unknown.</p>
          <p>We have several letters written by Thomas B. Slade while at the
		  University. He tells of a marriage between Richard Thompson and Miss Nancy
		  King, of the engagement between Miss Eliza Henderson and Hamilton C. Jones, of
		  the 22d of February speech by Walker Anderson, which was very much admired;
		  that Anderson and William H. Haywood are struggling hard for the Latin speech,
		  and that it is difficult to say who will get it.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, Slade gives a description of some of the students, which
		  shows that he had a good judgment of character. Wm. H. Haywood, fully sustains
		  the high reputation he had at the Raleigh Academy, as a young man of the first
		  talents. Clement Read is also struggling for the Latin Salutatory. In the
		  Junior class Owen Holmes and Martin Armstrong strive with him, but he has left
		  them far behind, and their envy has led to disputes, which have injured the
		  Dialectic Society. Slade and Anderson live together at the President's house
		  (since burnt) as lovingly as brothers, which is “unusual between persons
		  of different societies.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p265" n="265"/>
          <p>James R. Chalmers is the same independent young man—is a warm
		  friend and advocate of Haywood, “and consequently ranks high.” He
		  has become more studious in his habits. He is thought to be of all his
		  class-mates the most brilliant. “His compositions are excellent, display
		  all the fire of imagination and originality of genius.”</p>
          <p>John M. Starke, of South Carolina, since coming to the University has
		  had a continued struggle for life, but his health is greatly re-established.
		  His mind and vivacity are unimpaired. In conversation he excels.</p>
          <p>James T. Morehead is the same blunt, plain old fellow, respected by
		  all and loves to hunt and fish as well as ever.</p>
          <p>Ethelred Phillips has returned after his sickness and will join the
		  next Junior class. He is most assiduous and attentive. A book is his delight
		  and his talents are adequate to his application.</p>
          <p>David Williams has a most noble genius. Nature has bestowed talents
		  lavishly upon him, but it is feared, for want of industry, they will lie
		  dormant.</p>
          <p>David W. Stone is a fine young man and in mathematical talents is
		  equal to any in the class. He has concluded to graduate.</p>
          <p>The subsequent careers of these youths fulfilled the promise of their
		  student life.</p>
          <p>Besides those I have elsewhere mentioned, Martin W. B. Armstrong
		  became a physician of repute in Greensboro, New Salem and Salisbury. He was for
		  a short while acting Clerk of the Court of Stokes, and probably emigrated to
		  Tennessee, where his father had much land. He lost his diploma for striking
		  down Haywood with a club, in consequence of words spoken at a convivial
		  banquet. James R. Chalmers settled as a lawyer in Knoxville, Tennessee, and
		  reached the dignity of Attorney-General. James T. Morehead was a prominent
		  lawyer of Greensboro and a worthy member of Congress and of the State
		  Legislature. He was a brother of Governor Morehead. Ethelred Phillips, uncle of
		  Judge Fred Phillips, was a physician of fame in North Carolina and Florida. He
		  cured himself of pulmonary consumption by extreme care as to clothing and diet,
		  to the extent of changing clothing on the slightest change of temperature,
		  certainly every morning, noon and night throughout <pb xml:id="p266" n="266"/>the
		  year. David W. Stone was a son of Governor Stone, was first a lawyer and then
		  the esteemed President of the Branch of the Bank of Cape Fear at Raleigh.</p>
          <p>In 1820 occurred a furious conflict between two students named Martin,
		  but of no kinship. Robert was from Granville, tall, orderly and high-spirited,
		  a grandson of Nathaniel Macon. The other was Henry Martin, of Stokes County,
		  strong and pugnacious, a son of Colonel James Martin, of the Revolution, by his
		  second wife, the mother of Hamilton C. Jones. Robert was a member of the
		  Philanthropic Society, and while the Society was in session Henry Martin made
		  his way into the attic room above its Hall, and in leaping over the rafters
		  fell through the ceiling. As he was a member of the rival society this was
		  deemed an intentional insult and was resented by Robert Martin. The quarrel
		  resulted in a fight, which came very near causing a pitched battle between the
		  members of the two societies. Governor Graham shortly before his death stated
		  that he witnessed the conflict. Henry, being the stouter, endeavored to close
		  with his antagonist, which Robert prevented by warding off and returning his
		  blows, slowly backing towards the well. By these tactics they fought from the
		  door of Gerrard Hall to the well before they were parted. According to the
		  Governor's recollection, Robert was not thrown, but there is a contrary
		  tradition among his relatives to the effect that the Dialectic champion jumped
		  on his prostrate breast, causing such internal injuries that he died soon after
		  his graduation in 1822. Dr. Hooper in his “Fifty Years Since”
		  sustains in part at least this tradition. He states that the Di “got his
		  antagonist down and beat him most dreadfully.” My conclusion is that
		  there were two fights. President Caldwell thought best to prosecute the victor
		  before the Superior Court then in session at Hillsboro. Dr. Hooper was one of
		  the guard and tells the story of the proceedings: “It was a rainy night,
		  the prisoner purposely kept his horse in a walk, that we might not bring him
		  into town at night as a guarded criminal. So we rode up at breakfast time, like
		  a party of travelers to the hotel, where the Judge and prosecuting officer and
		  a crowd of people were standing. Our mittimus was examined, when lo and behold!
		  the Justice of the Peace <pb xml:id="p267" n="267"/>who issued it had left out of
		  the writ the initials of his office ‘J. P.,’ and without those
		  magic letters it was as harmless as a lion with his head cut off. So the whole
		  proceeding was quashed, the prisoner discharged, the expedition covered with
		  ridicule, and the escort went home pretty well sick of Sheriff's
		  business.”</p>
          <p>The feud did not, however, end here. The Di champion became incensed
		  at language reported as having been used by the Phi while at Hillsboro, and
		  seeking the latter in his room renewed the fight. We have no details of its
		  result. The Faculty dismissed the aggressor at once, and the wrathful feeling
		  among the students soon died down and gave place to other excitements.</p>
          <p>About the same time four other students, convicted of
		  “quarreling and fighting in their rooms,” were called up and made
		  to sign a pledge to keep the peace.</p>
          <p>An epidemic of explosions of gunpowder prevailed about this time which
		  gave the Faculty great annoyance. In the language of the grave Secretary,
		  Joseph H. Saunders, there could be no object other than “to disturb
		  society in a very violent manner, except the additional one of sporting with
		  the injury done the order of the institution; it must ever be considered an
		  offence of much aggravation.” The punishment was dismission or suspension
		  according to the previous record of the student. There was ingenuity expended
		  in securing loud explosives. In one case a hollow brass knob was covered over
		  with lead and filled with the powder. The noise made was pleasing to the ears
		  of the festive youths.</p>
          <p>There is extant a contemporary printed letter from an unknown
		  traveler, who urged upon the students in the kindest terms more civil behavior
		  at public exhibitions. He deprecated “expressions of contempt towards a
		  decent stranger, who was entertaining them with delightful music.”
		  “If a stranger enters their room he is treated with marked politeness.
		  Why not carry into public conduct the same character of genteel
		  breeding?” “Surely the bloom and gaiety of youth would receive
		  embellishment from gentleness, grace and dignity of behavior.” He warns
		  them that their boisterous conduct is becoming an insult <pb xml:id="p268" n="268"/>
		  to the officers of the University and even to the fair sex, and asks, “Is
		  the enjoyment of wit and pleasantry impossible without noise? Is it necessary
		  to be boisterous in order to be happy?” There is no record as to whether
		  this appeal had any effect in mitigating the evil sought to be remedied. It is
		  noticeable that a French traveler in England in the fifteenth century was
		  amazed to find that people seemed to be unable to express joy except by loud
		  shouting, bell ringing, explosions of gunpowder, and other “unharmonious
		  noises.”</p>
          <p>While most of the students dressed plainly, those who held the post of
		  Marshall and Ball Manager, and the Commencement speakers, had more costly
		  apparel. We have a bill for one suit of clothes. Black broadcloth coat, cost
		  $34; Cassimere pantaloons $14, and British florentine waistcoat
		  $8; Total, $56. The late Judge Battle remembered that the
		  University servant, a worthy negro, known as Brad, kept a pair of boots for
		  hire to students only. They were in special request for visits to the belles of
		  Raleigh, Hillsboro and Pittsboro, who were famous throughout the State for
		  physical and intellectual attractions.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1881 we had an eloquent and instructive address
		  by a class-mate of President Polk, an excellent specimen of the old school, an
		  octogenarian, Gen. Edward J. Mallett, of New York, lately called to his final
		  home. He was introduced as having received his diploma sixty-three years before
		  that day, and it was stated that for seventy years he had never taken a glass
		  of ardent spirits, and, therefore, that he had still the inestimable blessing
		  of <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">mens sana in corpore
		  sano</foreign>,</hi>and that other still greater blessing <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">mens sibi conscia recti</foreign>.</hi>In
		  his autobiography, printed only for his relatives, a copy being donated to our
		  Historical Society, we find an account of the ball given in compliment to his
		  class, when graduating. The following description of his dress is
		  interesting.</p>
          <p>“The style of costume,” said Gen. Mallett, “and even
		  the manners of the present generation are not, in my opinion, an improvement on
		  a half century ago. The managers would not then admit a gentleman into the
		  ball-room with boots, or even a frock coat; and to dance without gloves was
		  simply vulgar. At the Commencement Ball (when I graduated, 1818), my
		  <pb xml:id="p269" n="269"/>coat was broadcloth, of sea-green color, high velvet
		  collar to match, swallow-tail, pockets outside with lapels, and large
		  silver-plated buttons; white satin damask vest, showing the edge of a blue
		  under-vest; a wide opening for bosom ruffles, and no shirt collar. The neck was
		  dressed with a layer of four or five three-cornered cravats, artistically laid
		  and surmounted with a cambric stock, pleated and buckled behind. My pantaloons
		  were white canton crape, lined with pink muslin, and showed a peach-blossom
		  tint. They were rather short in order to display flesh-colored silk stockings,
		  and this exposure was increased by very low cut pumps with shiny buckles. My
		  hair was very black, very long and queued. I should be taken for a lunatic or a
		  harlequin in such costume now.”</p>
          <p>In 1827 the Trustees prescribed a uniform of dark gray in summer and
		  blue in winter, but six months afterwards changed the winter color to a dark
		  gray, so that it is probable that our boys were the first in the State to wear
		  the dress which is so intimately associated in Southern minds with the
		  tenderness, pathos and heroism of the Lost Cause. A solemn ordinance was
		  adopted at the same time, which sounds strange in our ears, “The wearing
		  of boots by the students is positively prohibited.” This law was passed
		  doubtless on account of the financial panic of 1825, but, like all sumptuary
		  laws, was regularly circumvented. The Seniors during the Commencement at which
		  they graduated were exempt from the prohibitory boot law by special exception
		  to the ordinance, and it was not long before ambitious Juniors, Sophomores and
		  Freshmen obtained the distinguished privilege.</p>
          <p>In a letter from his father, Joel Battle, a student in 1798-99, to his
		  son, William, the late Judge Battle, is some homely advice of value at this
		  day. He cautions his son against jumping into cold water when hot. “I
		  caught dysentery when at Chapel Hill by that.” He sends 2 3-4 yards of
		  broadcloth for a coat and vest for his son's Commencement suit. As the Judge
		  was a small man that was doubtless sufficient. On his graduation a horse and
		  gig would be sent for him. The driver will lead an extra horse for him to ride
		  home, from which it appears that the gig had only one seat.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p270" n="270"/>
          <p>Information is given of the financial condition of the farmers of
		  Edgecombe in February, 1820. The writer had sold pork in Virginia at $6
		  per hundred—one-half cash, the other half in four months. He started 152
		  hogs in the drove and got 143 to market. The other nine all returned home
		  except one or two. Those sold averaged 149 1-2 pounds, so that the drove
		  brought nearly $1,300. There was great distress for money in the county.
		  Thirty negroes had been recently sold in Tarboro for debt. There were Sheriff's
		  sales almost every day or two. Wm. Ross bought a woman at $581; A. J.
		  Thorp, at $300. These doubtless have been “on account of those
		  dangerous and fatal rocks, imprudence and extravagance.”</p>
          <p>These extracts are given because “hard times” were a
		  serious obstacle in the path of the University then, and at other periods. Six
		  cents a pound—half on credit—for hogs driven over 100 miles, shows
		  that money was hard to get.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE VILLAGE OF CHAPEL HILL.</head>
          <p>The government of the village of Chapel Hill was primitive. All white
		  males between 21 and 50 years of age were distributed into classes and in turn
		  patrolled the streets at night. Slaves were liable to a whipping of ten lashes,
		  or a fine of one dollar, for being absent from home without a written permit
		  from the owner. Nor could a slave hire his own time.</p>
          <p>Shooting firearms in the village “in sport, wantonness or
		  licentiousness” was forbidden under a penalty of one dollar. But firing
		  on public occasions or musters was not only not prohibited but encouraged. Two
		  dollars was the penalty for working on Sundays in one's ordinary avocation,
		  unless in case of necessity or mercy. Nor, with like exception, could any
		  person buy or sell any article under penalty of five dollars, doubled in case
		  of sales by merchants.</p>
          <p>The streets were to be worked by male white persons between 18 and 45,
		  and black males between 16 and 50. Fines for whites were inflicted for
		  absences. Whipping for slaves was the rule, but owners could save them from
		  punishment by paying a fine. The Commissioners were to pay one dollar for
		  absence from meetings without excuse.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p271" n="271"/>
          <p>We are fortunate in having a description of the village in a letter
		  from Wm. D. Moseley, written in 1853. At the beginning of 1818 Dr. Caldwell had
		  almost as meagre a Faculty as he commanded when he was presiding Professor in
		  1797. Wm. Hooper, Professor of Ancient Languages, was on a health tour in the
		  South. Dr. Mitchell, Professor of Mathematics, did not arrive for two months
		  after the session opened. There were 92 students, and the President had his
		  hands full, with his two Tutors, in charge of so many unruly boys. The
		  following is the substance of Moseley's description of the village:</p>
          <p>There was one street, running east and west, called Franklin or Main
		  street. The Raleigh and Hillsboro road crossed this, that part to the south
		  being Raleigh, that to the north being Hillsboro street. East of Raleigh street
		  were two dwellings fronting on Franklin, that at the corner, the residence of
		  President Caldwell and wife. The other, east of it, was the property of Prof.
		  Wm. Hooper.</p>
          <p>On the north side of Franklin and east of Hillsboro street was the
		  dwelling of Mrs. Puckett, widow of the late John Puckett, once Postmaster. This
		  was the lot afterwards bought by Professor Olmstead and by him sold to the
		  University. Between the part of the campus fronting on Franklin street and
		  Raleigh street there were only two residences, Hilliard's Hotel, afterwards the
		  Eagle, and now Chapel Hill Hotel, and next to Raleigh street the dwelling of
		  Tom Taylor, a merchant, afterwards sold to the University for Tennessee land.
		  It is now occupied by Dr. Eben Alexander. The Episcopal church was not built
		  until long afterwards.</p>
          <p>In front of the campus, including the grounds where are now the
		  Presbyterian church and the stores of R. S. McRae and H. H. Patterson, was
		  woodland, owned by the University. Between that and Hillsboro street were only
		  two buildings. One, about half way, was a store belonging to Tom Taylor, and
		  the other, at the corner of Hillsboro and Franklin Streets, the home of Wm.
		  Pitt, now belonging to the heirs of Henry C. Thompson.</p>
          <p>Columbia street is perpendicular to Franklin in the western part of
		  the village. Between that and the part of the campus <pb xml:id="p272" n="272"/>
		  fronting on Franklin were two residences only. That adjoining the campus, now
		  Central Hotel, was the residence of James Hogg, father of the eminent lawyer,
		  Gavin Hogg. Next to Columbia street lived the widow Mitchell, who dispensed
		  table board.</p>
          <p>Opposite James Hogg's was Major Pleasant Henderson's, father of the
		  attractive Miss Eliza. West of this about 150 yards was the store of Mr. Trice,
		  and further still, at the corner the blacksmith shop of Christopher or Kit
		  Barbee.</p>
          <p>At the southwest angle of Columbia and Franklin streets was the famous
		  boarding house of Mrs. Elizabeth or Betsy Nunn, and south of that was the only
		  other building on Columbia, that of Wm. Barbee, long the Steward of the
		  University.</p>
          <p>At the junction of Cameron Avenue and Pittsboro streets was the
		  residence of Mrs. Pannell, whose fair daughter captivated the heart of Tutor,
		  afterwards Bishop James H. Otey, and became his wife. Opposite Mrs. Pannill's
		  on Cameron Avenue was Mr. Watson's, the father of Mayor John H. Watson and Mr.
		  Jones Watson, merchant and lawyer, long esteemed citizens of Chapel Hill. The
		  father came near being a martyr of the University. He was a carpenter, working
		  on a third-story scaffold of the South Building, when he stumbled and was
		  precipitated over the edge of the scaffold. A friendly nail caught the seat of
		  his tow breeches, of tough flaxen fibre, and held him suspended over the deep
		  abyss, in a plight pitiable but safe.</p>
          <p>There was no other house on Cameron Avenue to the westward. All was
		  forest, wherein were numerous chinquapin bushes. Adjoining the campus was the
		  President's house, then occupied by the new Professor of Mathematics,
		  afterwards of Chemistry, Dr. Mitchell.</p>
          <p>Governor Moseley overlooked the residence of the Principal of the
		  Grammar School, Rev. Abner W. Clopton, east of the campus, now the Battle
		  residence. The grove in front of it was then thick woods.</p>
          <p>The only college buildings were the East, the South and Person Hall,
		  or the “Old Chapel,” now, largely increased in size, devoted to the
		  use of the Department of Medicine.</p>
          <p>Governor Moseley remembered that the graveyard contained about half a
		  dozen graves. He recalled Rock Spring, southeast <pb xml:id="p273" n="273"/>of the
		  campus, now Brickyard Spring, and the Twin Sisters, north of the village, below
		  which the waters were conducted through a gutter, having a fall of about ten
		  feet, and making an excellent open air-down-pouring bath. The Davie Poplar was
		  even then, eighty years ago, called the Old Poplar.</p>
          <p>In his distant home, said Moseley, living the life of a hermit, worn
		  out with old age, his six children all grown but one, he rejoiced over the
		  successes of the University, “much of it due to Swain's great abilities
		  and untiring energy.” He felt glad that the last vote he gave as Trustee
		  was for him as President.</p>
          <p>The records show where the students of 1819 had their dormitories. I
		  give the list, that it may be compared with Moseley's description of the

          <p>It should be noted that the Mrs. Mitchell in this list was not the
		  wife of the Professor. As might be expected, Governor Moseley omitted some of
		  the inhabitants, but very few. Certainly Mrs. Craig and Mr. Kittrell lived out
		  of the village—perhaps others. Mrs. Burton occupied Steward Hall. She
		  took the house with the burden that the ball might be conducted in the
		  dining-room, free of charge. I do not know where were the residences of Mr.
		  Thompson, Mr. Moring and Mr. Strain. Mrs. Burton was the young widow of a
		  citizen of the village, who had died the year before.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p274" n="274"/>
          <p>It was at this period, 1819, that the management of Steward's Hall as
		  an adjunct of the University was discontinued and the students allowed to get
		  their table board where they pleased. As long as the manager was an employee of
		  the institution and especially, as in the early days, compulsory eating at his
		  table was the rule, grumbling was the staple conversation and rowdyism often
		  prevalent. The village increasing in population, Steward Hall was rented out on
		  condition that the tenant, Mrs. Burton, should supply food to student
		  applicants at not exceeding $9 per month for the first year and
		  $10 afterwards. This plan was continued about twenty years longer, the
		  compulsory feature not being renewed.</p>
          <p>This “Steward's Hall” was a two-story wooden building
		  fronting west, painted white, in the middle of what is now Cameron Avenue, and
		  exactly north of the Carr Building. It was there that most of the students for
		  many years boarded at Commons, paying for the first year, 1795, $30, or
		  $3 per month; for the next four years $40 per year, or $4
		  per month; in 1800 rising to $57 per year; in 1805 to $60; in
		  1814, under the inflated war prices, to $66.50; in 1818 to $95;
		  in 1839 to $76, when the system was abandoned. It was in this building
		  that the “balls” of the old days were given, at which, tradition
		  has it, venerable Trustees and Faculty, together with their pupils, with hair
		  powdered and plaited into “pig-tails,” and legs encased in tight
		  stockings and knees resplendent with buckles, mingled in the dance with the
		  beauteous damsels of the day.</p>
          <p>Judge Battle, who graduated in 1820, boarded, as did James K. Polk and
		  others, at the house of Benjamin Yeargin near the creek in Tenney's plantation,
		  about a mile from the University buildings, at the foot of a long, steep
		  hill.</p>
          <p>Governor Moseley stated that Polk and he were the first who studied
		  Conic Sections. They occupied the same room, that at the southwest corner third
		  story of the South Building, soon afterwards to shelter another excellent
		  student, William A. Graham. The study was regarded by most students as
		  extremely difficult.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>CONDUCT OF STUDENTS.</head>
          <p>Most of the misconduct at this period consisted of fighting and
		  annoyances to the Faculty. The war fever was partly the <pb xml:id="p275" n="275"/>
		  cause of the former. The familiar songs were all boastful of the deeds of Perry
		  and McDonough, Decatur and Hull, and of General Jackson. But the war spirit was
		  stimulated to action partly by use of intoxicating liquors so common that the
		  Faculty hardly censured it except when drunkenness resulted; even then often
		  not cutting the offender off from the institution. But this was not the sole
		  cause. There was evidently a fashion to resort to bodily injury for fancied
		  insults. It is noticeable that it was not considered derogatory to one's
		  reputation to knock his antagonist down with a club, without warning. T. D.
		  Donoho, afterwards a lawyer of repute, wrote to his friend Armstrong, who had
		  felled W. H. Haywood in this manner, that all his friends sustained him as
		  having acted properly.</p>
          <p>Another class of offences was impertinent and offensive speeches and
		  conduct towards the Tutors. Most of this arose from irritation at being ordered
		  by men, little, if any, older than themselves, to repair to their rooms, when
		  found visiting a friend after 8 o'clock at night. A son of Chief Justice
		  Henderson, usually a polite and good-natured youth, stoutly insisted that the
		  officer had no right to “order him about,” and submitted to being
		  sent home, “rather than surrender his rights as a freeman.” Others,
		  however, while obeying the officer's commands secretly vented their spite by
		  exploding gunpowder at his door, throwing stones through his windows, shouting
		  abusive words from a distance in the darkness, and other like amenities. One
		  Tutor became so obnoxious by his tactless severity that it became necessary to
		  fortify his window-panes with wooden shutters.</p>
          <p>One of the Secretaries, Tutor Andrews, has left on record as evidence
		  in a case on trial the dialogue between the Tutor and the student-offender,
		  whom he found visiting a friend. It is worth quoting as showing the actual
		  working of a hard law.</p>
          <p>Tutor—Mr. H.—Do you know that the bell has rung for 8
		  o'clock?</p>
          <p>Student—Yes, sir; I know that it has rung.</p>
          <p>Tutor—Do you not intend to go to your room?</p>
          <p>Student—I intend to go by and by.</p>
          <p>Tutor—Why not now, Mr. H.?</p>
          <p>Student—I wish to read some more before I go.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p276" n="276"/>
          <p>Tutor—I require you to go to your room.</p>
          <p>Student—I shall go when I get ready.</p>
          <p>Tutor—Do you intend to say that you will not go to your
		  room?</p>
          <p>Student—I shall go as soon as I am ready.</p>
          <p>Mr. H. was called before the Faculty and was asked “on what
		  footing he proposed to place himself in regard to this transaction?” On
		  his replying that he ought to have obeyed the Tutor, and regretted that he had
		  not, and that his purpose was to obey the laws of the college, he was
		  acquitted.</p>
          <p>It is evident from the Faculty records that, while there was vigilance
		  in detecting offenders and strictness in pronouncing sentence, the law-givers
		  were very placable provided the offender acknowledged his fault, approved the
		  law broken as reasonable, and gave a written promise to obey all the laws in
		  the future. But there was sure punishment if there was refusal to do either of
		  these. There is good reason to believe that many students considered the
		  promises as not binding because they were in the nature of duress. Falsehood
		  was not considered as heinous as at present. There are numerous cases of
		  students answering for one another at Prayers, and the only punishment was a
		  reprimand. There was a striking case of a Senior positively assuring the
		  Faculty that another, under probation, could not possibly have gone to
		  Pittsboro, become intoxicated there and have done other wrongs, because to his
		  knowledge he had never left Chapel Hill. A Professor visited Pittsboro and
		  found that all this was false. In his defence the false witness avowed that he
		  would not have lied for himself. His punishment was holding back his diploma
		  for a year. Card-playing, even for amusement, was considered a high crime. The
		  players, as well as bystanders, whether occupiers of the room where the game
		  was carried on, or visitors, were sternly dealt with. To escape dismission they
		  were compelled to admit that it was wrong to play, that they regretted having
		  played, and would refrain in the future, and moreover that they would never
		  countenance a game by their presence, nor allow it in their rooms. Where four
		  students, after religious service on Sunday, were whiling away the interval
		  before dinner with <pb xml:id="p277" n="277"/>a short hand, they were dismissed or
		  suspended according to their previous bad or good conduct.</p>
          <p>Another trouble the Faculty had was in regard to horse-racing. There
		  was a track near the Hill, a few hundred yards west of the railroad station.
		  The races were inaugurated largely by liquor sellers and gamblers, and were
		  frequented by many drunken and disorderly persons. The students were forbidden
		  to attend, but some went disguised and undetected. Those caught were suspended
		  from the institution. One enterprising Tennesseean, orderly and studious,
		  stationed himself where he could see the horses run, while he did not approach
		  the shouting, betting, riotous crowd. Was he guilty? The verdict of the Faculty
		  brings out so clearly the stately verbiage considered “good form”
		  in that day that I quote it: “In the disposition which the Faculty feel
		  to act on the side of forbearance, where the circumstances are susceptible of a
		  different construction in the mind of the offending person, it was resolved
		  that the case of the said W. L. be exempted from any other consequence in the
		  present instance than a warning given to beware of acting in such a manner in
		  regard to the rules of the college as bears the appearance of practicing
		  evasion.”</p>
          <p>As showing the leniency of the sentences, I give this case which
		  occurred in 1823: J. E. was convicted, 1st., of frequent absences from
		  recitation without excuse; 2nd., intoxication; 3d., of being a leader in a
		  great noise and tumult in a public passage; 4th., fastening up the door of a
		  Tutor's room; 5th, of boisterous and profane swearing, “aggravating this
		  offence by such a manner and by such circumstances as announced it to be his
		  intention that the oaths should be proclaimed in the ears of a member of the
		  Faculty”; 6th., of attending disguised in borrowed garments at a
		  horse-race contrary to the express orders of the Faculty; finally, of
		  “habitual insubordination and licentiousness of conduct.” He was
		  suspended for only four months. In another instance W. H. was discovered
		  intoxicated and very noisy. He was suspended for two months.</p>
          <p>T. P. was with a noisy assembly at one of the doors. It was the day
		  before the 22d of February and exercises had been suspended. A Tutor ordered
		  him to leave the company. He obeyed, but joined another crowd, and was ordered
		  to leave <pb xml:id="p278" n="278"/>that. He refused, alleging that he was in his
		  legal rights. He was required to acknowledge that he had done wrong and would
		  in the future obey the laws. The sentence was “until said T. P. shall
		  make the concessions stated he shall be dismissed.”</p>
          <p>A. F. rose to declaim his piece before the Faculty. Whether from
		  stage-fright or idleness he could pronounce only one or two lines. Being told
		  that he must perform the duty on the next evening he avowed his determination
		  never to do so. He was dismissed. After a week's cogitation he changed his mind
		  and was required to perform the duty, express regret for disobedience and
		  promise to obey the laws.</p>
          <p>W. E. N., intending to leave the institution, invited a number of
		  students to a drinking party at his room. A number assembled. Four were found
		  playing cards. They were arraigned for this, not a word being said about the
		  drinking. They pleaded that the students always played during examination week.
		  This did not avail them and they were required to sign a pledge, asserting that
		  “the habit of card-playing tends to create a dangerous attachment to that
		  employment, and eventually to lead to the fatal practice of gaming,” that
		  they sincerely regretted having played, because it is against the University
		  laws, and that they pledged themselves not to play again and not to allow
		  others to do so in their rooms. One of the number refused to sign and was
		  dismissed. He afterwards changed his mind and was re-admitted on signing the
		  paper; and another, acknowledging that he did wrong in declining to sign when
		  the others did, was pardoned.</p>
          <p>W. H., the feast-giver, applied for leave to be absent at
		  Commencement, but the Faculty refused consent, and he went home without it. For
		  this and for the above-said feast he was dismissed. The context shows that the
		  chief offence was the absence without leave.</p>
          <p>J. R. and J. J. R. were charged with making a disturbance at Prayers.
		  They refused to express disapprobation of such tumultuous proceedings or to
		  give assurance that they would refrain hereafter. They were dismissed. It
		  appears that the disturbance was an attempt to prevent the reading of a minute
		  <pb xml:id="p279" n="279"/>of the Faculty. What this offensive minute was is not
		  recorded, but, as a student, J. F., had been dismissed two days before for
		  writing indecent words on the walls, and it was customary to announce such
		  sentences from the rostrum at the time of Prayers, it is likely that the
		  friends of the dismissed man were manifesting their sympathy with him, and
		  resentment at his treatment.</p>
          <p>It must not be supposed that such outrages as I have narrated were
		  continuous. There were long intervals of quiet, and there were many students
		  whose demeanor was never censurable. In a report to the Trustees in 1822 the
		  Faculty unanimously used this language, “When we consider the numbers,
		  industry and virtuous and manly deportment of the young men who resorted to
		  this place for the purpose of obtaining an education we are ready to
		  congratulate ourselves on the great present and increasing prosperity of the
		  institution.”</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>AMENDMENTS TO CHARTER—OLD EAST ENLARGED—OLD WEST <lb/>
		  BUILT.</head>
          <p>In 1819 important amendments to the charter, drawn by Bartlett Yancey,
		  were enacted. By the charter of 1789 there were five Trustees from each
		  judicial district, in all 40. Vacancies were to be filled by the other
		  Trustees. The members present with the President and Treasurer, or a majority
		  without either of those officers, were a quorum. By act of 1798 the attendance
		  of the Treasurer was dispensed with. By act of 1804 filling vacancies devolved
		  on the General Assembly and the number was raised to not exceeding eight for
		  each district. By act of 1805 the Governor was made President of the Board
		  <hi rend="italics">ex officio,</hi>but, if he wished, he could appoint a
		  substitute. The Board could vacate the seat of a member who had not attended
		  for two years. By act of 1807, it being found difficult to secure a majority,
		  seven were constituted a quorum, and could appoint a President
		  <hi rend="italics">pro tempore.</hi></p>
          <p>The General Assembly did not carry out the law requiring eight from
		  each Judicial District. In 1821 there were in office 54 Trustees. These were
		  continued, namely, John Haywood, Benjamin Smith, William Polk, Henry Potter,
		  Archibald D. Murphey, Duncan Cameron, Joseph Caldwell, Thomas Winns,
		  <pb xml:id="p280" n="280"/>Edward Jones, James Webb, Henry Seawell, Calvin Jones,
		  John D. Hawkins, Robert H. Jones, Jeremiah Slade, Joseph H. Bryan, Robert
		  Williams, William Gaston, Thomas Brown, Francis Locke, Montfort Stokes, Thomas
		  Love, Archibald McBride, Atlas Jones, Lewis Williams, William McPheeters,
		  Frederick Nash, Thomas Ruffin, James W. Clark, John Stanley, Bartlett Yancey,
		  Leonard Henderson, John Branch, William Miller, Simmons J. Baker, George E.
		  Badger, Kemp Plummer, Thomas D. Bennehan, Willie P. Mangum, James Mebane, John
		  Witherspoon, John B. Baker, James Iredell, William D. Martin, Joseph B.
		  Skinner, James C. Johnson, Enoch Sawyer, Alfred Moore, John D. Toomer, John
		  Owen, Gabriel Holmes, Romulus M. Saunders, Lewis de Schweinitz, and Thomas P.
		  Devereux.</p>
          <p>The number was now increased to 65, being the number of the counties,
		  but the residence of one in each county was not prescribed. Nine additional
		  were elected, namely, Lewis D. Henry, Francis Lister Hawks, Richard Dobbs
		  Spaight, the younger, Solomon Graves, James Strudwick Smith, M.D., Leonard
		  Martin, Thomas Wharton Blackledge, Thomas Burgess, and Archibald Roane
		  Ruffin.</p>
          <p>Vacancies were to be filled by the General Assembly. The extraordinary
		  power was given to the Board at their annual meetings to remove a Trustee for
		  improper conduct, provided fifteen should be present. The usual quorum was
		  fixed at seven. Special meetings were authorized but they could not alter any
		  “order, resolution or vote” of an annual meeting. The restriction
		  on the power of special meetings was made more stringent by an act passed in
		  1824.</p>
          <p>The active Trustees at this period were William Miller, John Branch,
		  Edward Jones, James Mebane, Frederick Nash, David Stone, Henry Seawell,
		  President Caldwell, John Haywood, Thomas D. Bennehan, William Polk, Wm.
		  McPheeters, D.D., James Webb, Thomas Ruffin, A. B. Murphey, Simmons J. Baker,
		  Robert Williams, of Raleigh, James Iredell, of Edenton, afterwards Raleigh.</p>
          <p>In this year on the urgency of President Caldwell, the Trustees
		  resolved to add a story to the Old East and to build the Old West of the same
		  size, and also a new Chapel. The necessary 
		  <figure><graphic xml:id="ill6" url="bat1-280.jpg"/><p>OLD WEST BUILDING.</p><p>GERRARD HALL, SOUTH SIDE, BEFORE REMOVAL OF PORCH.</p></figure><pb xml:id="p281" n="281"/>funds were expected from the Tennessee
		  land sales, and in anticipation thereof $10,000 was borrowed from the
		  banks. Two years afterwards $20,000 additional was authorized, and the
		  bank stock of the University, in the total 375 shares, pledged for re-payment.
		  Afterwards another $10,000 was raised in the same way. The
		  <choice><sic>committeee</sic><corr>committee</corr></choice>recommended that the permission of the
		  General Assembly should be obtained but this was not done. The salary of the
		  President was at the same time increased to $1,600.</p>
          <p>The resolution to enter upon the construction of new buildings was in
		  opposition to the views of the Faculty. In an earnest paper, in the handwriting
		  of Professor Mitchell, it was urged that the true policy was to purchase books
		  and apparatus. “The first impression of enlightened strangers is
		  uniformly favorable,” they say. “But when we show them our library
		  and inform them that we have little or no philosophical apparatus, we sink even
		  more than is reasonable in their estimation.”</p>
          <p>It seems that the large room in the middle of the south side on the
		  first floor of the South Building, now the Law Room, extended to the third
		  floor, and was called Prayer Hall. The Faculty recommended that a floor be
		  thrown across this at the second story and the space below be turned into two
		  large lodging rooms, which by an arrangement common in other colleges might be
		  used for recitation rooms. The second story might be used for a Library and
		  Philosophical Chamber. The present Library should be converted into two lecture
		  rooms. These changes would provide for 106 students in all, and perhaps room
		  might be made in the fourth story of the South Building, thus accommodating
		  110. The proportions of those living in the University buildings to those
		  living without last session were 82 to 68. The alterations would make the
		  numbers 106 to 44, or 110 to 40.</p>
          <p>The petition closes with this extraordinary argument and prediction.
		  If invested in apparatus, the property will not be perishable.
		  “Instruments with careful usage will be as valuable one hundred years
		  hence as now.”</p>
          <p>The Trustees could not be diverted from their purpose, but they
		  resolved to purchase the apparatus, some of which after <pb xml:id="p282" n="282"/>
		  the lapse of 75 years is still used. The floor was thrown above Prayer Hall,
		  but the room below was not divided but converted into a Chemical Laboratory.
		  The ceiling was built and the rooms above made into a combined Library and
		  Lecture Room for the President and Professor of Rhetoric. The stately books,
		  dust-covered and unread, remained until the erection of Smith Hall in 1852.</p>
          <p>At the same time the cupola on the South Building was torn down
		  because of its ruinous and leaky condition, and the roof made continuous. The
		  cupola was not replaced until after the expiration of over thirty years.</p>
          <p>The work on all the buildings was left to Wm. Nichols, architect of
		  the old Capitol at Raleigh. The plan was for him to make contracts for lumber,
		  labor and other things necessary and obtain the funds for paying for the same
		  from the Building Committee, often advancing the amounts out of his own
		  resources. It was found that the two buildings and some repairs and changes in
		  the South Building would cost $26,587.54, including $1,000 for
		  commissions for the services and compensation of Nichols, including also
		  surveying and laying off some lots at Chapel Hill. The bricks were made on the
		  University lands, the water being obtained from the spring south of the present
		  Athletic Field known as Brickyard, but in old days, Rock Spring.</p>
          <p>After this settlement, which exhausted the funds on hand, the Building
		  Committee concluded that the prospect of sales of Tennessee lands and
		  collections for those already sold justified them in proceeding with the
		  erection of the new Chapel. A bargain was made with Mr. Nichols that he should
		  assume the responsibility of all payments and await the convenience of the
		  Trustees for re-imbursements. Probably on account of the panic of 1825 he was
		  unable to meet the demands upon him. The creditors urged their claims upon the
		  Trustees. The Committee therefore deemed it best to stop the work and discharge
		  all the debts, especially as there was no prospect of funds from any source
		  necessary for completing the building. The amount expended, together with
		  compensation to Nichols, was $3,410.14. There was abundant hostile
		  criticism of his management, <pb xml:id="p283" n="283"/>which the committee frankly
		  admitted to have been wasteful and costly. They excused themselves partly by
		  their distance from Chapel Hill and partly by the fact that the Superintendent
		  was for several months disabled by a dislocated ankle.</p>

          <p>When Abner W. Clopton gave up the Grammar School in 1819, the
		  University abandoned it. At that time there was an uncommonly good classical
		  school in Hillsboro called the Hillsboro Academy. The general superintendence
		  was under Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, but the active teacher was Mr. John
		  Rogers, who had distinguished himself in his profession at Wilmington.
		  President Caldwell induced them to agree that their institution should be
		  preparatory to the University. Members of the faculty could participate in the
		  periodical examinations of the pupils and those passing the examinations of the
		  highest classes had a right to enter the University on certificate of the
		  fact.</p>
          <p>The old Grammar School house was then left to the bats and owls, but
		  was after some years in the occupancy of a family whose head was the last
		  survivor in this section of a class, important in the early settlement of the
		  country, and interesting figures in fiction—that of the professional
		  hunter. His name was Peyton Clements.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding that the University ceased its connection with a
		  preparatory school at Chapel Hill, sundry teachers endeavored to supply its
		  place. The first was a graduate of the class of 1816, James A. Craig, who
		  advertised extensively in the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register,</hi>then
		  the <hi rend="italics">State Gazette.</hi>We have no means of knowing his
		  success, but feel sure that parents at a distance were not willing to send to
		  him their boys of tender years. Certainly when Judge Battle and others in 1843
		  and 1844 attempted, with very competent teachers, to inaugurate a flourishing
		  academy at Chapel Hill the number of pupils did not exceed a dozen, not one of
		  whom was from abroad. The schools here relied on local patronage and that was
		  meagre. Still from time to time, intermittently, there have been teachers of
		  intelligence and skill, and many of their boys have taken a high stand in the
		  University.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p284" n="284"/>
          <p>The first honor in the class of 1820 was assigned to Charles G.
		  Spaight, the next to Wm. H. Battle. Then came Thomas B. Slade, Thomas E. Read,
		  Bartholomew F. Moore, James H. Otey, and Thomas H. Wright.</p>
          <p>In scholarship a shade the best, Charles G. Spaight, son of Governor
		  Richard Dobbs Spaight, the elder, who spoke the Latin Salutatory, was a man of
		  great promise. He represented New Bern in the Legislature but his upward career
		  was cut off by early death. Next to him Battle, to whom the Valedictory was
		  assigned, was Reporter of the Supreme Court and Judge of the Superior and
		  Supreme Courts of this State. Another honor speech was by Thomas B. Slade, on
		  Natural Philosophy. He emigrated to Columbus, Georgia, and became the Principal
		  of the first great female school in the State, a Doctor of Divinity in the
		  Baptist church. Read's career I have not been able to trace. Moore was one of
		  the most eminent lawyers the State has had, particularly distinguished in
		  constitutional questions. James H. Otey was the venerable Bishop of Tennessee.
		  Wright was a physician and President of the Bank of Cape Fear. Connected with
		  this class, but not graduating, was John Hill, of Stokes; a Representative in
		  Congress and member of the Convention of 1861, dying soon after voting for the
		  Ordinance of Secession.</p>
          <p>The subjects of graduating speeches not named above were:</p>
          <p>Are Banks Beneficial to the Country?, debate by Thomas H. Wright and

          <p>The degree of Bachelor of Arts was conferred on Malcolm G. Purcell and
		  the honorary degree of Bachelor of Arts on Ransom Hubbell. These were students
		  of irregular standing, but deemed substantially to have earned the degree.</p>
          <p>The best of the class of 1821 was J. R. J. Daniel, who spoke the Latin
		  Salutatory. Next was Anderson Mitchell, who had the Valedictory, and third and
		  fourth were Edward G. Pasteur and Joseph H. Saunders, to whom were assigned
		  respectively the Natural Philosophy Oration and that on the Belles Lettres.</p>
          <p>Intermediate honors were assigned to Willis M. Lea, Wm. S. Mhoon,
		  Samuel H. Smith and James Stafford, pronounced equal. Next to them were
		  Nathaniel W. Alexander, Nicholas J. Drake, Samuel Headen and Charles L.
		  Torrence, also pronounced equal.</p>
          <p>Daniel became Attorney-General of this State and Representative in
		  Congress, then a planter in Louisiana; Mitchell a Tutor in this University, a
		  Representative in Congress and then a Judge; Pasteur was a Judge in Alabama;
		  Saunders, a Tutor in this University, an Episcopal clergyman, who sacrificed
		  his life for his flock in a yellow fever pestilence in Pensacola, the father of
		  Colonel William L. Saunders, of the class of 1854.</p>
          <p>Of the others Mhoon became State Treasurer; Thomas J. Lacey, a Judge
		  in Arkansas; and George Washington Haywood, a leader of the Raleigh bar.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, Spier Whitaker was Attorney-General of North
		  Carolina and settled in Iowa after the Civil War.</p>
          <p>A matriculate of this year, Leonidas Polk, son of Col. Wm. Polk,
		  became a graduate of West Point, then Bishop of Louisiana, Lieutenant-General
		  of the Confederacy, and was killed on Pine Mountain in Georgia in 1864.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p286" n="286"/>
          <p>For the Commencement of 1821 there was projected a scheme of exercises
		  of portentous length. On Monday evening was “Public Speaking,”
		  presumably declamations, by Messrs. Joel Holleman, George W. Whitfield, James
		  H. Dickson, Wm. M. Inge, Alfred Scales, Abram Rencher and James Norwood.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday evening was Public Speaking by Messrs. Robert V. Ogden,
		  Benjamin Sumner, George S. Bettner, Robert B. Gilliam, Daniel B. Baker, John W.
		  Norwood and John W. Potts.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday evening were declamations by representatives of the two
		  societies. On Thursday, besides the speeches by the honor men, were the
		  following “disputes:”</p>
          <p>1. Has the Art of Husbandry been advanced more by the Philosophical
		  Agriculturist than by the Practical Farmer? Debaters. Wm. A. Mebane and Wm.
		  Murphey.</p>
          <p>2. Have the Moderns equaled the Ancients in Eloquence? Debaters,
		  Robert Cowan and Bryan S. Croom.</p>
          <p>3. Is it probable that the Aborigines of America would ever have
		  equalled the Ancient Romans if they never had had intercourse with the
		  Europeans? Debaters, Frederick J. Cutlar and Henry S. Garnett.</p>
          <p>4. Is it Sound Policy in the People of North Carolina to open and
		  improve the navigation of their rivers and coasts? Debaters, Benjamin F.
		  Blackledge and G. W. Haywood.</p>
          <p>5. Are early Marriages to be recommended? Debaters, Pleasant Henderson
		  and William Shaw.</p>
          <p>6. Is a Public preferable to a Private Education? Debaters, Rufus
		  Haywood and James Taylor; Thompson Johnston, Umpire.</p>
          <p>7. Has the Advancement of the Arts promoted the Happiness of Mankind?
		  Debaters, Johnson Alves and Thomas J. Lacey.</p>
          <p>On November 22, 1821, probably by the potent influence of State
		  Treasurer Haywood, Charles Manly, a young lawyer, who had married Haywood's
		  niece, was elected Secretary and Treasurer of the University in place of
		  General Robert Williams, deceased. The books of Williams were in such disorder
		  that an expert accountant, Daniel Dupre, was employed to straighten them and
		  the expense, $110, collected out of his <pb xml:id="p287" n="287"/>estate.
		  There was no suspicion of fault except carelessness. Manly was an excellent
		  officer, and being a polished speaker, of imposing manners, and an humorous
		  <choice><sic>reconteur</sic><corr>raconteur</corr></choice>, he was a welcome visitor to the annual
		  Commencements for 48 years. In 1848 and 1849 he attended as Governor and
		  President of the Board of Trustees, Major Charles L. Hinton holding the office
		  of Secretary and Treasurer until the expiration of his term as Governor, and
		  restoring it to him in 1850.</p>
          <p>In January, 1822, the community was thrown into a small-pox panic by
		  the tidings that ten newly arrived students had slept in Tarboro, a village
		  where that fell disease was prevalent. Among them were Augustus Moore, David
		  Outlaw and Simmons J. Baker. The Faculty promptly ordered them to be
		  “rusticated” five miles from Chapel Hill until the danger was
		  passed.</p>
          <p>On account of ill health Prof. Wm. Hooper resigned his Professorship
		  of Ancient Languages and became rector of St. John's Episcopal Parish in
		  Fayetteville. He recommended as his successor Mr. Manton Eastburn, of
		  Massachusetts, afterwards Bishop, as having distinguished literary
		  acquirements, particularly in the classics. He was a “brother of the
		  young man whose late untimely end Piety and Poetry must so long lament.”
		  Professor Hooper adds the suggestion that it might be agreeable to many of the
		  influential families of the State to have an Episcopal representative in the
		  Faculty.</p>
          <p>President Caldwell, however, acting on the endorsement of Professor
		  Goodrich, of Yale College, recommended Mr. Ethan Allen Andrews, of Connecticut.
		  He would bring the University “merit, talent and solid worth.” He
		  was a Senior when Messrs. Mitchell and Olmstead were Freshmen, obtaining the
		  first honor in a class of sixty; a fine scholar and of classical taste. His
		  profession was that of the law, and he had been a member of the Legislature.
		  “His connections are numerous and respectable.” A strong praise of
		  Prof. Hooper was given.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1822, the graduates being 28 in number, the
		  highest honor men were Benjamin Sumner, who delivered the Latin Salutatory;
		  Robert N. Ogden, the Valedictory, with an oration on the Moral Sublime; and
		  Joel Holleman, the Natural Philosophy address.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p288" n="288"/>
          <p>Of the other orators, Benjamin F. Haywood and Thomas Hill dared to
		  attack the venerable question, “Is Homer's Iliad Actual History?”;
		  Joseph A. Hogan endeavored to elucidate the character of Byron's Poetry; Lucius
		  J. Polk and Wm. D. Pickett discussed whether the new South American States
		  would continue to enjoy Political Freedom, while James Bowman discoursed on
		  Eloquence, whether eloquently or not does not appear; Robert J. Martin plunged
		  into State politics and proved that a Convention should be called to rectify
		  inequalities in representation in the General Assembly. In the afternoon Wm. B.
		  Davies spoke on Belles Lettres, William D. Jones on Intellectual Philosophy,
		  Thomas F. Davis and Robert H. Mason debated whether Studies, not having
		  immediate bearing on Political Life, are a part of a Liberal Education. The
		  Cultivation of Good Morals was inculcated by one whose name is not given,
		  probably by one of those to be preachers, John L. Davies, Wm. A. Hall or James
		  G. Hall, who had not already spoken.</p>
          <p>Of the honor men of the class of 1822, Benjamin Sumner, a relation of
		  Brigadier-General Jethro Sumner, was an esteemed Classical teacher and member
		  of the Legislature; Robert N. Ogden, Judge of the Superior Court of Louisiana,
		  and Joel Holleman, a Representative in Congress from Virginia. Other members
		  were Thomas F. Davis, Bishop of South Carolina; John G. Elliott, a quaint but
		  able teacher, so cadaverous as to receive the nickname of Ghost, which he
		  good-humoredly adopted as his middle name; Fabius J. Haywood, a physician of
		  Raleigh, of large practice; Pleasant W. Kittrell, State Representative of
		  Granville, an esteemed physician and University Trustee; Wm. D. Pickett, a
		  Judge of the Superior Court of Alabama; Lucius J. Polk, planter,
		  Adjutant-General of Tennessee; Abram W. Rencher, member of Congress, Governor
		  of New Mexico, and Charge d'Affaires to Portugal.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, conspicuous were Patrick Henry Winston, of
		  Rockingham County, a learned old bachelor, lawyer and Reporter of the Supreme
		  Court, and Hugh McQueen, Attorney-General of the State, a brilliant speaker of
		  irregular habits, who emigrated to Texas. He wrote a book called
		  “Touchstone of Oratory.” He recommends the young orator
		  <pb xml:id="p289" n="289"/>to strengthen his vocal chords by declaiming extracts of
		  great speeches as loudly as God gives him the power, preferably in the depths
		  of a forest.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>STATE GEOLOGIST.</head>
          <p>In this year (1822) the General Assembly authorized a Board of
		  Agriculture, and in the next year gave the Board authority to employ a
		  “person of competent skill and science to commence and carry on a
		  geological and mineralogical survey of this State.” The modest sum of
		  $250 per annum for four years, and a year in addition, was appropriated.
		  The Board employed Professor Olmsted, who made a report which was published,
		  the first probably of any State in the Union. After he returned to Yale the
		  survey was continued by Prof. Mitchell, who made one report. The appropriation
		  was not renewed. Both Professors made tours through the State. Part of the
		  diary of Dr. Mitchell is published as the James Sprunt Historical Monograph of
		  1906.</p>
          <p>Of the class of 1823, in number 28, Richmond M. Pearson, afterwards
		  Judge of the Superior and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, was first and
		  spoke the Latin Salutatory. Wm. S. Chapman was also first with the Valedictory,
		  afterwards a Judge in Alabama. Thomas G. Graham, second honor man, was a
		  physician; Robert B. Gilliam became Speaker of the House and a Judge of the
		  Superior Court; Daniel W. Courts became State Senator and Treasurer; George S.
		  Bettner was a physician in New Bern and New York, and author of a book called
		  “Acton, or the Circle of Life;” James H. Dickson was a physician of
		  wide reputation, author of an admirable address before the Alumni Association;
		  and James Augustus Washington achieved a national reputation as a
		  physician.</p>
          <p>Matriculating with these, though not graduating, were Wm. M. Inge, a
		  Judge in Tennessee; Alexander D. Sims, a member of Congress in South Carolina;
		  and Thomas Jefferson Green, a member of the Legislatures of North Carolina,
		  Florida, California and Texas, a member of the Texas Congress when it was a
		  Republic and a Brigadier-General in the Texan army.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on John
		  <pb xml:id="p290" n="290"/>Stark Ravenscroft, the first Episcopal Bishop of North
		  Carolina.</p>
          <p>We have the list of speakers on Commencement Day:</p>
          <p>Richmond M. Pearson, the Latin Salutatory.</p>
          <p>Thomas G. Graham, Natural Philosophy.</p>
          <p>Debate—Ought Military Posts be established on Columbia River?,
		  Alexander M. Boylan against James K. Leitch.</p>
          <p>Robert B. Gilliam, American Literature.</p>
          <p>George F. Davidson, Character of the Irish.</p>
          <p>James H. Dickson, Will the new States of South America continue
		  free?</p>
          <p>James A. Washington, Superstition of the Hindoos.</p>
          <p>George S. Bettner, Belles Lettres.</p>
          <p>Daniel W. Courts, Theatrical Entertainments.</p>
          <p>Thomas J. Sumner, Oratory.</p>
          <p>John Rains, Effects of the Waverly Novels.</p>
          <p>Wm. S. Chapman, Sympathy, with the Valedictory.</p>
          <p>The grades of Pearson, Chapman and Graham have been mentioned. The
		  third distinction was given to Bettner, Rains and Washington. What was called
		  the “intermediate” grade was assigned to James H. Dickson, Robert
		  B. Gilliam, Thomas J. Sumner, George F. Davidson, Daniel W. Courts and Matthias
		  E. Sawyer.</p>
          <p>Nineteen out of twenty-eight members of the Senior class of 1823
		  concluded, after they had passed their final examinations, to celebrate the
		  event by having a “high old time.” They procured a large quantity
		  of whiskey and brandy and carried it to a gushing spring north of the village,
		  known as Foxhall, doubtless a corruption of Vauxhall, once a London pleasure
		  resort, and proceeded to get on, as the phrase goes, a “glorious
		  drunk.” The tradition of the extravagance of this carousal lingers yet
		  about the village. After the reason of one of them was in a measure dethroned,
		  he proceeded to make a wholesale toddy by pouring the liquor into the spring,
		  forgetting how rapidly it would be diluted.</p>
          <p>On being summoned before the Faculty the delinquents pleaded that they
		  entered into the revelry because it was the last time they would be together,
		  and these final “treats,” as <pb xml:id="p291" n="291"/>they were
		  called, were customary with the Senior classes. The sentence was that
		  “proper concessions and acknowledgments” shall be made by all,
		  except one, and that then their diplomas should be granted. Direful
		  threatenings were made as to future like disorders. The excepted student almost
		  lost his diploma, because, in addition to being inattentive to all his duties,
		  he had behaved in a riotous manner on the streets after the “Senior
		  treat.” Among the festive youths of 1823 were a future Chief Justice, a
		  State Treasurer, two Judges of the Superior Court, four prominent physicians,
		  several able lawyers and other like good citizens. It is comforting to know
		  that the expected one wrote such a feeling and dignified letter of contrition
		  as to induce the Faculty to pardon him and the tale of the class was not
		  lessened.</p>
          <p>About this time two students were accused of writing scurrilous and
		  defamatory letters. One confessed and was reprimanded. The other, who falsely
		  denied his guilt and had committed the same offence before, was suspended. He
		  afterwards attained high legislative and judicial positions. It is altogether
		  likely, though not so stated, that the defamation was abuse of the Faculty.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>CALDWELL'S VISIT TO EUROPE.</head>
          <p>In February, 1824, President Caldwell addressed to the Board very
		  important recommendations. The first was for the purchase of more books. Much
		  advantage was derived from the expenditure for this purpose of the two dollars
		  per annum fee from each student, but this was not sufficient. Without it
		  “we must have become completely stationary, within limits, which if known
		  to others, would have been disgraceful.” “A Professor in a college
		  without books in tolerable supply, is analagous to the creation of nobility,
		  which for want of estate is obliged to live in rags.” He then compares a
		  bookless Professor to a lawyer without a legal library, to a shoemaker without
		  awls or lasts, to a printer with insufficient types. Books were much cheaper in
		  England than in America and cheaper on the Continent than in England.</p>
          <p>He added that it was impossible to carry on the study of Natural,
		  sometimes called Experimental, Philosophy, without a proper supply of
		  apparatus. For the purchase of such a reliable <pb xml:id="p292" n="292"/>agent is
		  necessary. “An Astronomical Clock, a Transit Instrument, an Astronomical
		  Telescope, are articles of high cost, and if they be not really good, they are
		  so much money thrown away, only to tantalize us with standing objects of
		  chagrin and disappointment.” Makers of philosophical apparatus, unless
		  carefully watched, will have their defective articles “mingled with the
		  mass of his instruments of the same kind and talked off upon the terms of the
		  best.”</p>
          <p>The President then modestly suggests his willingness to act for the
		  Trustees, paying his own expenses. He would be compensated for the sacrifice by
		  “personal improvement and accession of strength in regard to the affairs
		  of the University.” He submits to the judgment of the Trustees. Whatever
		  they shall judge to be the best he “shall be prepared to admit in a
		  moment, and to settle upon it with the utmost complacency and
		  conclusiveness.” The offer involved a trip to Europe, then a very
		  expensive and prolonged journey, full of physical discomforts.</p>
          <p>The Trustees felt strong enough to spend $6,000, to be divided
		  equally between books and apparatus, and accepted the offer of the President.
		  We have a long letter of his to Dr. Olmsted giving some account of his voyage.
		  The writer was singularly lacking in enthusiasm, the wonderful sights of the
		  Old World not seeming to quicken the heart-throbs of the back-woods
		  mathematician. It is dated London, August 31, 1824. It was forwarded by
		  “Y. A. Steamer, Thomas W. Evans, Liverpool,” and was received at
		  New York October 4th. It is as follows:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“It is now, it seems, more than two months since I arrived at
		  Liverpool from New York, and more than three since I left the latter of these
		  cities. After arriving in London I continued nearly a month in the city, first
		  visiting places and institutions of importance and becoming acquainted with
		  books and book-sellers, and instruments and instrument-makers. Having informed
		  myself of circumstances and characters I made a number of purchases and
		  engagements, and set off in a steam packet which runs between London and
		  Edinburgh. After a passage of 3 1-2 days we arrived on the Forth, where the
		  scenery of Scotland began to open upon our view. This was characterized
		  <pb xml:id="p293" n="293"/>by what is known as North Berwick Low, and Bass Rock at
		  the entrance of the Forth, as well as several other elevated places, presenting
		  the first appearance of those masses of rock, of which Scotland seems very much
		  composed. After having a pretty rough passage along the British coast of the
		  German ocean, during which most of the passengers and myself too, at last
		  became sick, we found a beautiful contrast in the tranquility and glossy
		  smoothness of the Forth. I continued in Edinburgh 10 days, and then passing
		  over to Glasgow, and staying some days, I set out for Loch Lomond, Rob Roy's
		  Cave, the Highlands, Loch Katrine and the Trosachs, returning by Callender,
		  Doane and Stirling to Edinburgh, down the Forth in a steamboat. I stayed two or
		  three days between Loch Lomond and Loch Katrine, among the mountains, in a
		  house or rather a cluster of buildings, called the Garrison, which had been
		  built 120 years ago, or more, as a station for troops, to keep in check the
		  wild clansmen of those times and subdue them to the English power. The garrison
		  is about a mile from Rob's Cave, and from a spot where they tell us his house
		  probably stood. One object for staying here was to be for some time in the
		  country of the shepherds, whom I visited in their cottages to observe their
		  mode of life and opportunities and customs and state of society. This is the
		  tour which is very commonly made by people from England and the Lowlands of
		  Scotland, and its objects have had much interest added to them by the writings
		  of Sir W. Scott. While in Loch Lomond I attempted to visit the summit of Ben
		  Lomond, the highest mountain but one in Scotland, but when near the top I was
		  driven back by a storm, and was thus prevented from seeing those extensive
		  prospects, which constitute the principal object of the ascent.</p>
            <p>“After my return to Edinburgh, reflecting to how little purpose
		  it is to be visiting universities during their vacations, as I had some
		  occasion to experience in Edinburgh, I concluded to postpone my visits to
		  <choice><sic>Cambride</sic><corr>Cambridge</corr></choice>and Oxford till after my return from the
		  Continent, and traveled sometimes on foot, but for the most part by coach to
		  this place, whence I am expecting to set out for Paris this week. Present me
		  respectfully and affectionately to Mrs. Olmstead and Miss Harriet and all my
		  friends.”</p>
          </q>
          <pb xml:id="p294" n="294"/>
          <p>The apparatus bought by the President was the best manufactured in
		  that day. It is a remarkable proof of his sensitive integrity, that when part
		  of it was lost by shipwreck, he offered to the Trustees to replace it out of
		  his own funds. The following statement by our Professor of Physics shows that
		  some of the implements are in good order after the wear and tear, and at other

		  further states that the full list of purchases shows that they were made with
		  excellent judgment.</p>

            <p>Apparatus purchased by Dr. Caldwell of W. &amp; S. Jones, No. 30,
		  opposite Furnival's Inn Holborn, London.</p>
            <p>June 26th, 1829, and still in good condition:</p>
            <p>1 3-feet Plate Electrical Machine.</p>
            <p>1 Jointed Discharger.</p>
            <p>1 Powder House.</p>

            <p>1 12-in. Convex Mirror in blackened frame.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Mrs. Fannie DeB. Whitaker has presented to the University, among other
		  papers found among those of her grandfather, Dr. William Hooper, the account of
		  Francis McPherson, for a portion of the books purchased: 53 volumes of Delphin
		  Classics, 89 to 141, were rated £55. 13s., about $277.25, or
		  £1 1s. ($5.25) each; for binding 83 volumes, calf, lettered
		  contents, hollow backs and bands, £12 9s., or 3c. each; the packing case,
		  10s., shipping expenses, duty, etc., £17; the whole bill being £77
		  1s. 6d. This is given to show the prices of that day.</p>
          <p>The account rendered by the President showed an expenditure—</p>
          <p><table rows="5" cols="2"><row><cell>For books </cell><cell>$3,234.74 </cell></row><row><cell>Philosophical and astronomical apparatus </cell><cell>3,361.35 </cell></row><row><cell>Minerals </cell><cell>9.00 </cell></row><row><cell>Boxing, packing, transportation and exchange </cell><cell>632.92 </cell></row><row><cell> </cell><cell>7,238.01 </cell></row></table>which exceeded the appropriation ($6,000) by
		$1,238.01. This excess was paid by the President, but refunded by the
		Board. The number of volumes of books purchased was 979. Mr. Cattell,
		<pb xml:id="p295" n="295"/>a bookseller in London, presented the University six
		volumes in folio, the works of Thuanus, and the British and Foreign Bible
		Society donated six volumes of the minutes of the Society, also 48 volumes,
		being copies of the Bible in different languages.</p>
          <p>One of Dr. Caldwell's most worthy pupils, the late Paul C. Cameron,
		  whose love and admiration continued fresh during a long life of over four-score
		  years after leaving his instruction, gives a vivid picture of his reception on
		  his arrival from Europe.</p>
          <p>“A trip to Europe was not then a summer's jaunt of a few weeks,
		  but caused his absence for nearly a year; and on his return to New York he
		  announced his arrival to Prof. Mitchell, the acting President of the
		  University, and the probable day of his arrival in Chapel Hill. He was on time.
		  The students of the University resolved on a welcome. A brilliant
		  illumination—the first and only one ever made in these
		  buildings—was resolved on and it was an entire success. Well do I recall
		  the splendor of that night and the procession of the students to his residence
		  and his stepping out upon the floor of the back piazza—the cheer after
		  cheer that was given to the dear old man. Falling into line, the march back to
		  the college was commenced, and on our arrival at the front door of the South
		  Building the President was escorted to a stand near the well, from which he
		  addressed the students and the entire village population with the affection of
		  a long absent father, for he was indeed full of feeling, and it was with
		  difficulty he could give utterance to his words. He was escorted back to his
		  modest home, and the impression prevailed that it was the happiest day of his
		  life—the consummation of his supreme joy.”</p>
          <p>At their meeting in December, 1825, the Trustees unanimously thanked
		  the President for his “faithful and judicious discharge of the trust
		  committed to him, and that he be assured of the unabated confidence of the
		  Trustees in his ability and devotion, at once honorable to him, gratifying to
		  the Trustees and useful to the community.” The resolution was drawn by
		  Mr. Badger, who had a deserved reputation for felicitous English.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p296" n="296"/>
          <p>The highest honor men of the class of 1824 were Edmund D. Sims, of
		  Virginia; Matthias Evans Manly, Thomas Dews, and William Alexander Graham. The
		  second honor man was E. J. Frierson. The third, John W. Norwood, James H.
		  Norwood, Benjamin B. Blume, Robert Hall, Henry E. Coleman, Thomas Bond,
		  Augustus Moore and David Outlaw. Sims spoke the Latin Salutatory, Manly the
		  Valedictory, Dews the Mathematical Oration, and to Graham was assigned the
		  Classical oration.</p>
          <p>The other speakers at Commencement were:</p>
          <p>Should the United States assist the South American Republic against
		  Spain and the Holy Alliance?, by Bromfield L. Ridley.</p>
          <p>The Character of the North American Indians, by James H. Norwood.</p>
          <p>Will Greece emancipated attain the eminence of Ancient Greece?, Daniel
		  B. Baker.</p>
          <p>Perpetuity of the United States, Henry E. Coleman.</p>
          <p>The Effects of the French Revolution on Liberty, Benjamin B.
		  Blume.</p>
          <p>The Effects of the Invention of Printing, Augustus Moore.</p>
          <p>Should a Professorship of Law be established at the University? James
		  W. Bryan.</p>
          <p>The Mahometan Religion, Thomas Bond.</p>
          <p>American Literature, John W. Norwood.</p>
          <p>Should the American Colonization Society receive the patronage of the
		  Public, Robert H. Booth.</p>
          <p>Of the foregoing, Sims was Tutor in this University and Professor in
		  Randolph-Macon and the University of Alabama; Matthias E. Manly was Speaker of
		  the State Senate, Judge of the Superior and Supreme Courts of this State,
		  elected in 1866 United States Senator, but not allowed to take his seat. Thomas
		  Dews became a very able lawyer, but dying early. William A. Graham, State
		  Senator and Commoner, Speaker of the House, United States Senator, Secretary of
		  the Navy, nominee for the Vice-Presidency on the Winfield Scott ticket, member
		  of the Convention of 1861, Confederate States Senator, Trustee for thirty-five
		  years and a warm supporter of the University. To him was assigned the classical
		  oration.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p297" n="297"/>
          <p>Other noted graduates of 1824 were Daniel B. Baker, Judge of the
		  Superior Court of Florida; John Bragg, member of Congress and Judge of the
		  Superior Court of Alabama; James W. Bryan, strong lawyer, Trustee of the
		  University and State Senator from Craven; A. J. DeRosset, physician and
		  merchant of Wilmington, Treasurer of the Dioceses of North and East Carolina
		  and often Deputy in the General Conventions of the Episcopal church; Augustus
		  Moore, Judge of the Superior Court of North Carolina; John W. Norwood, able
		  lawyer and member of the Legislature; David Outlaw, member of Congress, State
		  Solicitor, State Senator and Delegate to the Convention of 1835; and Bromfield
		  L. Ridley, Chancellor of Tennessee.</p>
          <p>On December 19, 1824, Dr. James S. Smith addressed a communication to
		  the Board recommending the employment of a regular physician for the students,
		  to be compensated by a fee from each. He expressed his willingness to undertake
		  the work himself, and in addition conduct a private Medical School together
		  with an Eye Infirmary. Dr. Smith was a physician of established reputation, a
		  Trustee of the University, and had been a Representative in Congress. The plan
		  was not adopted until three-quarters of a century later. Soon, however, there
		  was urgent need of skilled medical service.</p>
          <p>In this year a settlement was had with Wm. Nichols, who enjoyed the
		  double position of supervisor and builder. The accounts seem to show that there
		  was a want of careful superintendence by Nichols. One of the entries is,
		  “to sundry persons at sundry times, upon several drafts at sundry times
		  by the Building Committee” $7,402.04.” The final account is
		  “Labor and material in repairing President's House, Steward's Hall,
		  getting timber, making bricks and building new Chapel, taking down cupola from
		  the South Building, repairing roof and building belfry,” in addition to
		  the expense of building the West Building, $26,587.57. The Trustees
		  became disgusted with the continual drain from their treasury, and as the
		  receipts of sales of Tennessee lands had greatly dwindled, the new Chapel
		  (Gerrard Hall) was suffered to be unfinished and unoccupied for over ten years.
		  The delusion that it was necessary to have the Building Committee composed of
		  members of the Board, although <pb xml:id="p298" n="298"/>they lived a day's
		  journey from Chapel Hill, proved to be very expensive in practice. The notion
		  that college professors lacked practical sense was probably the cause of the
		  delusion.</p>

          <head>SOME COLLEGE PRANKS.</head>
          <p>Colonel Benjamin Forsyth was killed in battle in Canada in the war of
		  1812 and gave his name to a county. The education of his son, James N., was
		  being paid for by the General Assembly. In 1824 he forfeited his place in the
		  University by irregular conduct. He afterwards entered the navy and was lost
		  with the ship <hi rend="italics">Hornet,</hi>on which he was a petty
		  officer.</p>
          <p>One division of the Sophomores and the whole of the Freshman class
		  absented themselves from recitation on the morning of Senior speaking. They
		  were all required individually to acknowledge the impropriety of their conduct,
		  and pledge themselves to refrain from similar conduct in the future. All gladly
		  complied except R. J., who was dismissed. Ten days afterwards he made the
		  required promises and was readmitted.</p>
          <p>In 1824 occurred a flagrant outrage. A. A. and L. K. loaded themselves
		  with whiskey in the village grog-shop, and arming themselves, one with a club
		  and the other with a pistol, “sallied forth for the purpose of attacking
		  the persons of different members of the Faculty.” They committed
		  “violent outrages” on two of the persons hunted.</p>
          <p>The Faculty concluded that extraordinary proceedings were necessary.
		  The Trustees resident in Orange County were summoned to meet with the Faculty
		  to consider the case, namely, Thomas D. Bennehan, Esq., Honorable Duncan
		  Cameron, Francis L. Hawks, Esq., Hon. Thomas Ruffin, Dr. James S. Smith, Dr.
		  James Webb.</p>
          <p>The Faculty present were Rev. Elisha Mitchell, Presiding Professor;
		  Ethan A. Andrews, Joseph H. Saunders, Elisha Young. Dr. Caldwell was in
		  Europe.</p>
          <p>The young criminals expressed their regret for their misconduct, but
		  it appeared to the authorities assembled impossible that the peace and good
		  order of the institution could be maintained, if such outrages were permitted
		  to pass without exemplary punishment. The said A. A. and L. K. were therefore
		  <pb xml:id="p299" n="299"/>expelled. As we now say, “the line was
		  drawn” at cudgelling the Faculty with sticks, while looking into the
		  muzzle of loaded pistols.</p>
          <p>W. R. was dismissed for twice throwing brickbats into the room of the
		  Tutor.</p>
          <p>A youth, who afterwards became a distinguished physician, came from
		  the village in a state of intoxication and disturbed the good order of the
		  College in a most outrageous and violent manner. As this was the first offence,
		  he was sentenced to receive an admonition in the presence of the Faculty, and a
		  minute of the proceedings was read in the Chapel after evening prayers.</p>
          <p>There was a strange occurrence, at this day not to be accounted for.
		  In November, 1828, after the students assembled for divine worship in the
		  Chapel on Sunday morning, thirty of them retired from the hall, not all at once
		  but by degrees. The Faculty proceeded next morning to investigate the matter.
		  It was explained that two laws of the institution, one certainly and the other
		  apparently, had been broken. The first was absence from Divine service, the
		  second combination or conspiracy to break a law. The absentees were severally
		  examined as to their conduct. Seven at once gave satisfactory excuses, and were
		  allowed to retire. At an adjourned meeting six others offered valid excuses for
		  withdrawing. The remaining seventeen after being questioned disavowed any
		  combination, and the trial was ended. The <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">causa causans</foreign></hi>of the movement cannot be ascertained,
		  possibly some transient anger against the preacher. Some of the most orderly
		  students were among the retiring party, for instance, Wm. Eaton, R. H. Smith of
		  Halifax, Cadwallader Jones of Hillsboro, Judge James Grant of Iowa.</p>
          <p>On the resignation of Professor Olmsted, passed into the ownership of
		  the University the dwelling occupied for many years by Dr. James Phillips and
		  of late by President Venable. Belonging to a widow lady, Mrs. Puckett, it was
		  bought from her for $1,300 by Dr. Denison Olmsted, who spent $900
		  on it by way of additions and repairs. After having converted, to use his
		  language, “an awkward, inconvenient and rude structure into a handsome,
		  commodious and neat dwelling,” a description <pb xml:id="p300" n="300"/>which
		  must be deemed quite roseate by those who have seen its perpendicular outlines
		  and inconvenient interior, he induced the Board of Trustees to take it off his
		  hands at cost, using the argument that the expense of removal from New Haven
		  and of living had exhausted his funds. The lot was set apart for the use of the
		  Professors of Chemistry, but between Dr. Olmsted and Dr. Venable there was an
		  interregnum of over three-score years.</p>
          <p>Dr. Olmsted resigned his professorship in December, 1825, and accepted
		  that of Mathematics in Yale College, (now University). In 1836 he was
		  transferred to the Chair of Astronomy and Natural Philosophy. He published
		  text-books of value in the departments of science under his charge, and a
		  number of biographical memoirs. He made important observations on hail,
		  meteors, the aurora borealis, etc., which were published in the Smithsonian
		  Contributions. He was born in East Hartford, Conn., June 18, 1791, and died May
		  13, 1859. His work in North Carolina has been described elsewhere.</p>
          <p>The distinctions of the class of 1825 were awarded as follows:</p>
          <p>1st. To John M. Gee, Wm. H. Hodge, and Marshall T. Polk.</p>
          <p>2d. To Wm. J. Bingham, Wm. P. Boylan, James Martin, James Moore, and
		  John J. Wyche.</p>
          <p>3d. In the order of their names, to Frederic W. Harrison, Walter
		  Alves, Albert Vine Allen, Burwell B. Wilkes, Wm. A. Wright, and James C.
		  Bruce.</p>
          <p>The program at Commencement has been lost, except that Polk spoke the
		  Latin Salutatory, Hodge the Valedictory, Gee the English Salutatory, Wright,
		  Bruce Harrison and Alves had what were called Intermediate Orations, but the
		  subjects are unknown.</p>
          <p>Of these, Polk, a brother of President Polk, settled in North Carolina
		  at Charlotte, and was cut off in early life, considered one of the most
		  promising young lawyers in the State. His son, of the same name, who became
		  Treasurer of Tennessee, not a son of the University, left children who are
		  among the best citizens of that State. Hodge was a physician of Tarboro, and
		  then of Granville. Wm. A. Wright was an able lawyer of Wilmington and President
		  of the Bank of Cape Fear; Harrison <pb xml:id="p301" n="301"/>was a physician in
		  Virginia; Bruce a wealthy and cultured planter of Virginia, and member of its
		  General Assembly; William J. Bingham, the second able Principal of the Bingham
		  School, whose fame under him was extended; Wyche was a Tutor of the University
		  and Professor in Jefferson College, Mississippi; Alves, a physician in
		  Kentucky; Allen, a lawyer of much reputation.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) was conferred on
		  Nathaniel Macon, United States Senator; that of Master of Arts (A. M.) on
		  Charles Bailly and on John H. Eaton, of Tennessee, a matriculate of 1803. To
		  William Glascock, of Virginia, a matriculate of 1816, was granted the degree of
		  Bachelor of Arts (A. B.)</p>
          <p>In August and September of the year 1825 there was a very serious
		  sickness in the University, evidently typhoid fever. Three students
		  died—Wm. H. Beard, Zenas Johnston, and another whose name is not
		  recorded. The acting President reported that the first two brought the seeds of
		  disease with them. From an unknown cause it was thought that the air was worse
		  than usual, as was shown by the pallid countenances of the students generally.
		  There were no ponds or marshes near Chapel Hill and the disorder was attributed
		  to “unknown conditions of the air or water.” The learned Professor
		  drops no hints of ferocious and treacherous bacteria. Skilled physicians had
		  stated that the elevated parts of the country had suffered most. He recommends
		  that a resident physician should be obtained, who should teach a class of
		  medical students.</p>
          <p>At that date the Faculty had no power to prevent theatrical and other
		  shows. Urgent request was made that they be invested with such authority. A
		  band of strolling players had given nightly dramatic performances for a week
		  and had received, it was estimated, $383, more than $300 of which
		  was from students. Value received cannot possibly be expected from such acting
		  and scenery as can be exhibited in a room over a store in this village. The use
		  of the University Chapel was refused, as intolerable profanation. The General
		  Assembly passed a law in compliance with the wishes of the Faculty, giving them
		  prohibitory powers.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p302" n="302"/>
          <p>It is remarkable that complaint was made that the well between the
		  buildings had gone dry and the water at that of the Steward's Hall was muddy.
		  This must have been on account of insufficient depth, as pure water in the
		  former has been unfailing for the last sixty years certainly. The latter was
		  filled up when the Hall was torn down about 1846.</p>
          <p>It is surprising that when Gerrard Hall, designed for the new Chapel,
		  was begun the Trustees had it in mind to tear down Person Hall. A vigorous
		  remonstrance from the Faculty defeated this vandalism.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mitchell makes the astonishing statement that the old trees in the
		  Campus were falling, and there was no undergrowth from which a supply of new
		  trees was obtainable, and he recommends extensive replanting. Thirty years
		  afterwards the old trees were so numerous that the English gardener deemed it
		  necessary to eradicate many.</p>
          <p>About this time a prominent Trustee of Wake County, about to remove to
		  Tennessee, Gen. Calvin Jones, presented to the University his “Museum of
		  artificial and natural curiosities.” Probably some of these are somewhere
		  among the University collections, but it is doubtful if they can be
		  identified.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>NEW BY-LAWS.</head>
          <p>On motion of Bartlett Yancey, a number of resolutions were submitted
		  to a Committee, and at the June meeting, 1825, were substantially reported back
		  and adopted. They were:</p>
          <p>1st. The appointment by the Trustees of a Superintendent of the
		  property and financial concerns of the University, who shall reside at Chapel
		  Hill, give a $10,000 bond, and receive not exceeding $500 salary
		  per annum.</p>
          <p>2d. He was to care for all the property of the institution and carry
		  out all orders of the Trustees.</p>
          <p>3d. Each student shall pay him all his money, and shall pledge his
		  honor to pay all received at any time. The Superintendent shall out of the same
		  pay college dues and other necessary expenses, the repair of injury to College
		  property done by the student; also such purchases of merchants as the student
		  may buy, and to the student not over one dollar pocket-money each month.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p303" n="303"/>
          <p>4th. He shall pay the board of the student, provided that the
		  boarding-house keeper shall have written authority from the Faculty.</p>
          <p>5th. He must notify each parent or guardian of the student as to the
		  amount paid him, and at the middle and end of each session furnish them an
		  account of expenditures.</p>
          <p>6th. No student, under penalty of admonition or suspension, shall
		  purchase at Chapel Hill or elsewhere, wares or merchandise, or spirituous
		  liquors, without consent of the Faculty.</p>
          <p>7th. No student shall change his room without permission of the
		  Faculty.</p>
          <p>8th. The Superintendent must visit all rooms at least once a week,
		  note the injuries and their perpetrators, and at the end of the session take
		  charge of the keys.</p>
          <p>9th. Scribbling and other injuries in passages by unknown persons must
		  be charged to those living on the same.</p>
          <p>Thomas H. Taylor, a merchant of Chapel Hill, was appointed to the
		  office of Superintendent. He did not give satisfaction, and in January, 1829,
		  the Faculty were empowered to choose the Superintendent out of their number at
		  a salary of $200. They settled on Elisha Mitchell.</p>
          <p>Some Trustees desired to erect another boarding house. In the meantime
		  the Board of Visitors was authorized to employ some person to live in Steward
		  Hall and to have the privilege of firewood and the use of the cleared land
		  adjacent to the Raleigh road free. The Board recommended the students to board
		  with him. One Moore agreed to rent it for six months, paying fifty dollars.</p>
          <p>1st. A uniform dress was prescribed; in summer a coatee of dark gray
		  mixture, chiefly cotton, decent and cheap, with white pantaloons and waistcoat.
		  In the winter the whole suit must be blue. By a subsequent ordinance blue was
		  changed to dark gray.</p>
          <p>2d. The wearing of boots was prohibited. It was recommended that the
		  other parts of the dress should be plain and decent, and the persons
		  cleanly.</p>
          <p>3. The Seniors at Commencement might dress as they pleased, it being
		  presumed that they would wish superior attire on this momentous epoch in their
		  lives.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p304" n="304"/>
          <p>Letters were ordered to be written to Trustees, three in number, who
		  had not attended any meeting since their appointment, asking them if they
		  agreed to accept the office tendered them. The movement led to no result. Three
		  letters were written to which there was only one response.</p>
          <p>The annual Board of Visitors was reinforced by the addition of
		  President Caldwell, who was a Trustee. By this reinforcement there was always
		  one in attendance. For 1827 the other members were Duncan Cameron, James S.
		  Smith, and James Webb.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Yancey, Badger, and Moore (Alfred), were appointed, on motion
		  of President Caldwell, to prepare a bill for prohibiting the distillation or
		  retailing of spirituous liquors at or near Chapel Hill, and to prohibit the
		  merchants of the village from trading with the students. This was enacted into
		  a law. A Chapel Hill merchant was subject to indictment for selling without
		  Faculty permission to a student any article. The liquor prohibition still
		  exists. The other, always ignored, was repealed years ago.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>COL. POLK'S BY-LAWS—PROFESSORS PROTEST.</head>
          <p>The next year a properly fitted up room in the College buildings was
		  ordered to be assigned to each professor, and it was made his duty to be in it
		  from 9 a.m. to 12 m., and from 2 p.m. to 5 each day, except “Sundays and
		  other College holidays.” The object was to aid in the administration of
		  discipline and give occasional assistance to the students in their studies.</p>
          <p>It was stated that the nightly visitations of the rooms of students by
		  the Tutors had been insufficient to maintain order and insure the presence of
		  the students in their apartments. It was therefore required that each student's
		  room should be visited by a professor at night at least three times a week.</p>
          <p>This rigorous code was at the instance of Col. Wm. Polk, who always
		  regarded students in the light of soldiers in barracks and professors as
		  military officers. They were, with some modifications, obeyed, by some without
		  failure, by others spasmodically, until near the beginning of the Civil War.
		  They led to numberless clashings and ill feelings. The halls and campus were
		  not lighted, and occasionally stones and cold water were <pb xml:id="p305" n="305"/>
		  thrown at an unwelcome visitor. One, who was accused of opening a drawer of the
		  absent inmate, was forced to hide under a table in order to escape the missiles
		  through crashing glass. Signals were invented which showed to the listening
		  students the progress of the professor, so that card-players would have time to
		  open their dictionaries, and the corn-whiskey bottle could be safely hid. When
		  the word DOGS! or FACULTY! was shouted from the window of one building, it was
		  the sign that those in another might expect at once the professorial policeman.
		  While the manners of some professors were so agreeable that they were usually
		  welcomed, others were so rough that they became odious. Every species of
		  disorder was prevalent in the recitation rooms of these latter, partly in the
		  spirit of childish fun, but mainly for the annoyance of the instructor.</p>
          <p>The professors vigorously protested against the mandatory provision in
		  regard to spending their mornings and afternoons in the College buildings, and
		  nightly visitation of rooms. Dr. Mitchell addressed an able letter to the
		  Board, giving cogent reasons against it. He himself could not comply, as he
		  must spend most of his time in his laboratory, which was in Steward's Hall. It
		  was unfortunate that the professors were not consulted, as they are in the
		  position of both witnesses and lawyers. The visiting rooms at night will do no
		  good, as students wishing to go on excursions will wait, as they do now in case
		  of the Tutors, until the visits are over. The students will not consult
		  professors about their studies, as was found by experience at Yale and at
		  Chapel Hill. They are afraid of the jeers of their fellows. If rooms were
		  provided the professors would undoubtedly be in them often and so secure better
		  order without requiring them to spend their mornings and evenings in them. The
		  professors have not been slow to improve the work of the University of their
		  own accord. As an instance, when he came to Chapel Hill the two upper classes
		  recited only once a day, the lower twice. The Faculty have continually
		  increased the number of recitations, and he believes that they are more
		  frequent than in any Northern college. The provision will be peculiarly
		  burdensome for several reasons:</p>
          <pb xml:id="p306" n="306"/>
          <p>1st. As there is no market in Chapel Hill, the professors must spend
		  some time in providing for their families.</p>
          <p>2d. For their own studies their libraries should be on hand. They
		  cannot be removed to the College rooms.</p>
          <p>3d. Most of the professors are engaged in some study, which would be
		  broken up if this regulation is in force. Professor Hentz, for example,
		  “perhaps is one of the most accomplished Entomologists, perhaps the most
		  accomplished in America.” He must ramble in the woods two or three
		  evenings in the week.</p>
          <p>The regulation will be a hardship: 1st, Because professors would be
		  exposed to a charge of want of fidelity to duty; 2d, it is an evil, because it
		  precludes the possibility of exact compliance with the laws, and thus gives
		  excuse to students to neglect them.</p>
          <p>Such duties are not required of Professors in the American Colleges,
		  and those in the wild woods of Chapel Hill, deprived of large libraries and
		  scientific and literary journals, except what they themselves supply, should
		  not be loaded with duties not performed elsewhere.</p>
          <p>If this provision is enforced he apprehends that we will lose Mr.
		  Hentz, “a man whose fellow will not be found by the Trustees in the whole
		  Atlantic coast.” He thinks that another will be lost. “I shall not
		  be regarded as meaning to threaten the Trustees with the good luck of getting
		  clear of the writer of this letter. I have had an opportunity within the last
		  two years of exchanging my present situation for a professorship in a
		  respectable college in one of our Northern cities with a salary of 2100
		  Dollars, and, if the allurement of 900 Dollars added to his income, and the
		  polished society of a great city, is not enough to draw a <hi rend="italics">Yankee</hi>away, it is useless to think by the imposition of
		  new duties to drive him away.” While he deemed himself fixed in Chapel
		  Hill, it is likely that some of his colleagues might accept new and more
		  congenial duties.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mitchell was doubtless sincere in announcing his determination to
		  stand by the University, because he had no love of money and he looked on North
		  Carolina as a luxuriant field for botanical, geological, mineralogical and
		  geographical discoveries, and he had resolved to explore it.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p307" n="307"/>
          <p>President Caldwell made also an earnest request for the repeal of the
		  law. He declared that visitation of rooms was the most unpleasant and arduous
		  duty the Faculty had to perform. “They are exposed to petty tricks and
		  occult, insulting behavior, and capricious indignities. One of the chief
		  inconveniences is drenching with water, clean or foul, as they pass the steps
		  or walk the passages. Such tricks may be performed with great perfection by the
		  most trifling genius or idle inhabitant of College, who has no other feeling,
		  but to exult in its dexterity and admirable meanness, and then to pass the jest
		  through the circle of his companions, thus learning to connect in their
		  feelings derision and levity, instead of respectful deportment with the person
		  of a Professor.”</p>
          <p>The Trustees were partly persuaded by the arguments against
		  domiciliary visits. A compromise was made. Rooms were allotted to the
		  professors, and they were requested, not required, to spend a portion of each
		  day in them, and they were required to make nightly visitations only
		  occasionally. As late as 1849 certainly, perhaps later, each professor in turn
		  was expected to visit every room at some time at night during the week assigned
		  him. It became customary to speak of Dr. Mitchell's week, Prof. Hooper's week,
		  and so on. Greater tact was shown and insults to the Professors were rarely
		  offered. When, however, a “spree” was determined on, there was
		  neither civility nor forbearance shown.</p>
          <p>Prof. Mitchell, who possessed greater initiative than any of his
		  colleagues, about the same time induced the Faculty to recommend several
		  changes.</p>
          <p>Firstly, that the long summer vacation be abolished on account of its
		  injury to the health of the students, and replaced by one of six weeks,
		  immediately preceding commencement, as at Harvard and the South Carolina
		  College. Another of four weeks in November was proposed. A thrifty argument is
		  urged that the May vacation would enable the summer clothing to be supplied at
		  home. The change would enable those connected with the University to explore
		  the State “for Botanical and Geological purposes.” The objection
		  that this arrangement would not be convenient to the members of the Board
		  <pb xml:id="p308" n="308"/>appointed to attend the examinations is met by the half
		  satirical statement that, “after repeated alterations of the time and
		  repeated attempts to adjust it to the various wishes of the different
		  individuals, the examinations have been obliged to be carried on for several
		  years without the presence of a single Trustee until very near its
		  close.” It is suggested that suitable literary gentlemen be employed and
		  compensated for acting as examiners.</p>
          <p>If the change should be made the four weeks' recess to the Seniors
		  before Commencement should be abolished.</p>
          <p>The memorial embodies a complaint that the present Superintendent,
		  Thomas H. Taylor, had departed from the old custom of paying the Faculty from
		  time to time sums out of the tuition money, that he retained all his own salary
		  and otherwise appropriated the funds, leaving little for the members of the
		  Faculty.</p>
          <p>It is suggested that the Librarian should be paid for his
		  services.</p>
          <p>The President's Report shows that he and his Faculty were not yet
		  emancipated from the interference of the Trustees in small matters of routine.
		  It is gravely asked that the hiring and employment of servants be allowed them.
		  They are disturbed about the ordinance about wearing gowns at Commencement. By
		  whom were they to be furnished? Shall all the Faculty and students be required
		  to don them? It appears that the Trustees did not insist on the execution of
		  this mandate.</p>
          <p>A question most earnestly pressed by the Senior class was that of a
		  Senior vacation, i. e. a holiday given to them for one month before
		  Commencement. Occasionally the Trustees ordered its abolition, but always a
		  moving petition two or three pages long touched their hearts and met a
		  favorable response to the prayer for restoration. One signed by William Eaton
		  and Rufus A. Yancey, son of Bartlett Yancey, is a fair example, committeemen at
		  other times being such men as Thomas S. Ashe, Rev. J. Haywood Parker, Calvin
		  Jones, Giles Mebane, J. DeBerniere Hooper. The petition alleges firstly, that
		  the time was needed for the preparation of Commencement speeches, and secondly,
		  that as neither suitable cloth, nor a skilled tailor, could be found at Chapel
		  Hill, the graduates <pb xml:id="p309" n="309"/>should be allowed to go home and
		  there prepare such habiliments as would reflect credit on the University. The
		  practice lasted until the closing of 1868. Regularly for fifteen or twenty
		  years after the re-opening in 1875 the Faculty were called on to negative
		  petitions for its revival.</p>
          <p>A riot, in which five students were engaged, shows a roughness of
		  manners not paralleled now. Becoming angry for some cause with Wm. Barbee, the
		  ex-Steward, who had been recently in the Legislature, colleague of Willie P.
		  Mangum, they proceeded one Sunday night to rock his house, crashing the window
		  panes and even the sashes. Barbee swore out a warrant against the leader and
		  the others were summoned as witnesses. To use the stilted words of the clerk of
		  the Faculty, the witnesses “resorted in their minds to such construction
		  of the oath and of the questions put to them, as in their apprehension relieved
		  them from the necessity of testifying in relation to their companions, in
		  consequence of which the protection of society was withheld from the person,
		  the family and property of one of its citizens.” The leader and one other
		  were dismissed. The remaining three were suspended, two for four and one for
		  three months.</p>

          <head>SOCIAL LIFE OF CHAPEL HILL IN THE TWENTIES.</head>
          <p>One of the most popular Chapel Hill belles of this period, very
		  winning and beautiful, a good singer, accustomed to raise the tunes in church
		  service, was Miss Sarah Williams Kittrell, whose father removed from Granville
		  to a home about two miles southwest of the University buildings, where he
		  carried on a farm and took student boarders. Tradition says that she agreed to
		  marry a promising Senior, afterwards United States Senator, but the match was
		  broken off because of his poverty and great distance from Chapel Hill. After he
		  became famous, he returned by invitation to deliver the annual Commencement
		  address, and his old boarding house keeper, Mrs. Betsey Nunn, upbraided him for
		  breaking faith with her favorite Sally Kittrell. Learning that she was living
		  in Midway, Texas, in her 90th year, Mrs. Goree, aunt of Judge George W.
		  Kittrell of California, I wrote to her and received in reply a
		  <pb xml:id="p310" n="310"/>most sprightly letter, giving her reminiscences of
		  Chapel Hill society. I add that five of her sons and grandsons were officers in
		  the Confederate Army, and that during a visit of Miss Winnie Davis to Texas she
		  rode one hundred miles to pay her respects to the “Daughter of the
		  Confederacy.” The kindly manner in which she speaks of her old flame
		  indicates that their engagement and its disruption, if true, left no permanent
		  scar on her happy soul. With her aid and from other sources I endeavor to
		  depict the life of Chapel Hill in the twenties.</p>
          <p>There were few residents of the village, but among them were strong
		  characters, male and female. Among the men Dr. Caldwell and Dr. Mitchell
		  overtopped all in learning and influence, while in society Major Henderson and
		  his four sons, James, William, Pleasant, and Tippoo Saib,
		  <ref xml:id="ref5" target="#n5">*</ref>
		  <note xml:id="n5" anchored="true" target="#ref5">	 *Note.—The hatred of England by our people is shown by their
				naming sons after cruel oriental despots, simply because they fought our old
				enemy. Thus Davie had a Hyder Ali, Major Henderson a Tippoo Saib, and a
				prominent citizen of Edenton a Tippoo Saib Haughton.</note>all physicians,
		  were most agreeable and accomplished, “loved and honored by rich and
		  poor.” The leader among the ladies was the wife of the President, a
		  daughter of James Hogg of Hillsboro, who had moved from girlhood in as polished
		  society as the United States afforded. There were bright and handsome young
		  ladies, educated at the female schools of Salem and Oxford, of whom were Betsy
		  Pannill, and Franky Burton who became the wife of Thomas J. Green, afterwards a
		  prominent lawyer of Virginia. Wm. Barbee, son of Christopher (or Kit) Barbee,
		  one of the donors of the University lands, had several daughters, who were very
		  attractive, one of whom married Ilai Nunn, a skilled violinist, who gave
		  lessons in dancing; another Jesse Hargrave, a merchant, and a third Dr. B. W.
		  Cave, a physician of the village. </p>
          <p>There was an excellent Sunday School held in Person Hall, called the
		  Chapel, now the Medical Building. The teachers were Mrs. Caldwell and the wives
		  of the Professors. The task was memorizing five or six verses of the Bible and
		  part or whole of a hymn. Four score years afterwards the pious “Mother in
		  Israel” recalled vividly the moral and educational value of this, one of
		  our earliest religious institutions for the young.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p311" n="311"/>
          <p>The village teacher was called “Old Father Hughes,” an
		  Englishman by birth, but devoted to his adopted country, a thorough teacher and
		  strict disciplinarian, using frequently the rod on boys but gentle to the
		  girls, who doubtless suffered vicariously when the blows descended on their
		  brothers and sweethearts. In one end of the school-room at play hours the good
		  Father added to his petty tuition receipts by the sale of pickled oysters and
		  ginger cakes, into which traffic went every penny which the children could
		  raise. After Father Hughes, came Rev. Abner Clopton, a Baptist preacher,
		  teacher of the Preparatory school of the University.</p>
          <p>As might be conjectured from the increase of the income from the
		  students and in the number of the Faculty, together with a small addition to
		  their salaries, the village became larger and more modern between 1820 and
		  1830. The ladies arrayed themselves in finer clothes, improved their houses
		  with added rooms and with paint, cultivated grass and flowers on their lawns,
		  frequented the University and Society libraries, rode to hear preaching
		  sometimes in the neighborhood churches, especially Mount Carmel, induced
		  services in the University Chapel, prayed fervently but never aloud, at
		  prayer-meetings, and inaugurated reading clubs.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this forward movement, luxury was unknown. Modern
		  children and their parents would regard the mode of life at this period as one
		  of intolerable hardship. As a rule, to the boys and girls was allowed only one
		  pair of shoes for the year, which of course implies that naked feet were
		  fashionable except in freezing weather. Most families kept cows, and on farms
		  oxen. When these ceased to be producers their end was hastened by the deadly
		  axe or brain-piercing bullet, the flesh reserved for the table, and the skins
		  sent to the tannery to be converted into leather. Then one by one the children
		  placed their feet on the outspread hide under direction of an itinerant
		  shoemaker, who marked the shape with knife or chalk and made by hand the shoes,
		  rough but serviceable. Often from want of skill there was a tightness across
		  the toes or a misplaced protuberance, which caused suffering analogous to that
		  experienced by a high-caste Chinese girl. Then too there was
		  <pb xml:id="p312" n="312"/>a looseness around the ankles which admitted snow, and
		  the urchin came in from his winter sport with his feet well nigh frozen.</p>
          <p>The food was plenteous and palatable. In addition to the poultry, hogs
		  and beeves, which all raised for themselves, raccoons abounded on the creeks,
		  opossums and squirrels in the forest, partridges, larks, doves and hares
		  swarmed in the fields. As winter came on great flocks of wild pigeons darkened
		  the air, often resting at night in the oak trees, where they were slaughtered
		  by the wheelbarrow-full. Owing to the abundance of persimmons, the opossums
		  were so fat that their superabundant grease was used to make smooth the wagon
		  axles; their fur and that of hares, minks, muskrats and raccoons were fashioned
		  into winter caps for the boys. Then too there were many fish in the creeks, and
		  part of the daily task of the pretty black-eyed Sally Kittrell was, accompanied
		  by a brother, to visit their fish traps and bring in the catch for the
		  breakfast fry.</p>
          <p>The clothing was mostly home-made. Small patches of cotton were
		  planted, and for some time the seed was picked out by hand. Each child had his
		  or her task, and after all were finished they were regaled with cider and
		  apples. After this, lessons for the next day were studied by the light of split
		  lightwood or pine knot. Tallow candles were a luxury, reserved for a great
		  occasion, such as a preacher's visit, or a festive gathering.</p>
          <p>Mr. Kittrell, the father, imported the first cotton-gin ever seen in
		  this part of the world, not much larger than a sewing machine. After this there
		  was more cotton raised in the neighborhood. The date of the importation is not
		  exactly known, but it was prior to 1833, when he removed to Alabama. The
		  clothing was woven on the family loom.</p>
          <p>Before the advent of the Whitney gin, tobacco was largely raised. The
		  market was Fayetteville. The hogsheads containing the leaf were placed on
		  little wheels and thus rolled to Fayetteville, a horse pulling each. The driver
		  would be absent two or three weeks. His return was hailed with delight, for
		  each girl expected a calico dress and a pair of shoes, to be worn only on
		  Sundays.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p313" n="313"/>
          <p>The course of life was simple and happy. There was no umbrella, but
		  neither snow nor rain deterred from school and no one was afraid to be wetted.
		  There was little physic bought, but dyspepsia was never heard of. Trading was
		  mainly by bartering. Money was scarce, but the family never incurred debt.
		  Sally Kittrell never had twenty-five cents of her own until she was grown.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding all privations, there was probably more hearty fun
		  than in our day. Although they danced no germans, and some were not allowed to
		  dance at all, there were many social gatherings, with just enough work to make
		  play enjoyable—cotton-pickings, husking bees or corn shuckings,
		  log-rollings, hog-killings, house-raisings, quiltings, and even spelling bees.
		  In some of these the girls did not take a hand, but they cheered their beaux to
		  feats of skill and strength, and after the work was over all joined in games
		  and pleasant talk, not sparing the piquant anecdote and boisterous laugh.
		  Conspicuous among all the maidens, doubtless the only survivor of all her
		  associates, was Sally Kittrell, beautiful, graceful, agreeable, dutiful, pious,
		  whose memory of Chapel Hill after seventy years is still green, who in her
		  distant Texas home, radiating loving influences all around, remembers her old
		  home with so vivid clearness and such tender love that she signs the long
		  letter written entirely by her own hand—</p>

          <p>The “National Jubilee” was celebrated at Chapel Hill on
		  the 4th of July, 1826, the semi-centennial of the Declaration of Independence,
		  with enthusiasm. There was, according to the local chronicle, “the good
		  humor and cordiality which should ever be the characteristic of Freemen.”
		  There was a procession at eleven o'clock to Person Hall. The famous Declaration
		  was read by one who had fought for it in the Revolutionary struggle, Major
		  Henderson. It was properly enunciated, for the gallant Major, a brother of
		  Judge Richard Henderson, was <pb xml:id="p314" n="314"/>selected for thirty-nine
		  years to be Reading Clerk of the House of Commons on account of his sonorous
		  voice. The oration was by a young lawyer, William McCauley, graduate of 1813,
		  son of Matthew McCauley, a donor of the site of the University. He doubtless
		  bearded the British Lion in the manner fashionable on such occasions. At one
		  o'clock a dinner was served at Mr. S. B. Alsobrook's hotel, and at night there
		  was a ball, at which Virginia reels and cotillons were danced to the lively
		  tunes of Ilai Nunn's violin.</p>
          <p>In the autumn of the same year a horse-race was held in a mile of the
		  village, the principal objects being betting and gambling. The Faculty forbade
		  the students to attend it. One disobeyed and was suspended therefor. Another
		  stood afar off and witnessed the running but did not go into the crowd. He was
		  excused.</p>
          <p>There was at all times during the earlier decades of the University
		  delight among the students to engage in the explosion of gunpowder. There are
		  numerous complaints of the practice and prosecution of the offenders. The
		  following grave entry is a sample of the solemn opinions of the Faculty:
		  “This mode of producing disturbance in the College Buildings for some few
		  nights past, as it is a method of producing disorder full of evil effects, and
		  apparently having no other object but to annoy, is highly
		  reprehensible.”</p>
          <p>Other by-laws were added to the lengthening roll. The Professors and
		  Tutors were required to furnish the Trustees present at examinations with the
		  names of the members of the classes, so that “the Trustees may be enabled
		  to have their own opinion upon scholarship.”</p>
          <p>Each Professor and Tutor was required to keep account of the
		  scholarship, regularity and moral conduct of the members of his class, and
		  furnish an abstract of the same to the parent, and also to the Board of
		  Trustees.</p>
          <p>The students were not bound to promise more than once obedience to the
		  rules.</p>
          <p>Erasmus D. North was the best scholar and spoke the Salutatory Latin
		  oration, in the graduating class of 1826,—21 members.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p315" n="315"/>
          <p>The following were declared equal and next to North: Daniel Moreau
		  Barringer, who had an oration on Modern Languages; Samuel E. Chapman, the
		  Valedictory; William Norwood, on Political Economy; Oliver W. Treadwell, on
		  Classical Literature.</p>
          <p>Archibald Gilchrist, Thomas W. Watts, Henry T. Clark, Silas M.
		  Andrews, Richard S. Croom, James A. King, Henry B. Elliott, Ferdinand W.
		  Risque, Thomas S. Hoskins, and George W. Morrow spoke what were called
		  Intermediate Orations, while William J. Anderson, Henry I. Brown, Wm. B. Dunn,
		  Samuel I. Johnston delivered Forensics.</p>
          <p>Of these honor men, North was for a short while Professor of Languages
		  in our University, an Instructor in Yale, and a physician; Barringer, a member
		  of Congress and Minister to Spain; Chapman, a reputable physician of Newbern;
		  Treadwell, a Tutor in this University; and Norwood, an Episcopal Doctor of
		  Divinity over a large congregation in Richmond, Virvinia. Of the others, Clark
		  became Speaker of the Senate and Governor <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi>in
		  1861-62.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, was Paul C. Cameron, a wealthy planter, State
		  Senator, active Trustee of the University for twenty-seven years.</p>
          <p>In 1827 died John Haywood, one of the charter Trustees of 1789 and
		  continuously thereafter. He was always a member of the Committee of
		  Appointments and other like committees, and was one of the most active and
		  regular in attendance. His popularity in the State is shown by his annual
		  election as State Treasurer without opposition for forty years (1787-1827), and
		  by his name being given to a western county and to an eastern town. In
		  December, 1828, the Trustees, “in consideration of his long continued and
		  useful services” rendered to the University, granted a scholarship to his
		  son, William Davie Haywood. There is no record, however, of his entering the
		  University.</p>

          <head>EXERCISES OF 1827—MURPHEY'S ADDRESS.</head>
          <p>The multitudinous speeches on the programme of 1826 probably led to
		  the radical change of 1827. In that year began the series of orations by
		  eminent men elected by the two Literary Societies alternately. The Dialectic
		  had the first choice, which <pb xml:id="p316" n="316"/>fell on ex-Judge Archibald
		  Debow Murphey. His address was in the main historical and reminiscent and was
		  perhaps the last work of one who had done much for his State. His portrait in
		  the Dialectic Hall, taken at this time, shows that his physical powers were
		  rapidly waning, but his mind was strong and lucid. A contemporary writer in the
		  <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register</hi>testified that “the debility of
		  his body gave an interest to his appearance. Unassuming, yet easy and
		  insinuating in his address, clear and distinct in his enunciations, perspicuous
		  and eloquent in his style, he was sustained through a long and eloquent oration
		  by the admiration and applause of a crowded assembly.—None of his
		  audience will soon forget their own emotions, or the glow of sympathy imparted
		  to them by the orator's beautiful remembrance of his friend and patron, the
		  late Wm. Duffy.”</p>
          <p>The writer described the exercises as “No longer, as on former
		  occasions, a monotonous succession of heavy and uninteresting speeches, but a
		  Literary Banquet, where the different tastes of the audience were gratified by
		  alternate displays of Oratory and Wit.” “We were all particularly
		  pleased with a little ‘ludicro-comico’ piece written and (as the
		  Dramatists say) gotten up by one of the Professors, and called, I think,
		  ‘Improvements in Modern Duelling.’ It was well delivered Tuesday
		  evening by five young gentlemen, and exhibited in the most ridiculous attitude
		  certain late exquisites and proficients in that sublime art.” As Dr.
		  William Hooper was skillful in this kind of writing, conspicuous in his own
		  address in 1859, entitled “Fifty Years Since,” it is evident that
		  he was the author.</p>
          <p>It was at this time that, on motion of Chief Justice Ruffin, the
		  once-a-month holidays, which had been in vogue for some time, were
		  discontinued, to the great discontent especially of boys of a smaller growth,
		  or less studious disposition.</p>
          <p>The speakers of the graduating class of 1827 were: Richard Henry
		  Lewis, the Latin Salutatory; Charles B. Shepard, the Valedictory; Thomas P.
		  Hall, Oration in Greek; Lorenza Lea, Oration in French; Alfred O. P. Nicholson,
		  Oration on Political Economy; Jesse H. Lindsay and Alexander Mackey,
		  Intermediate Orations.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p317" n="317"/>
          <p>Of these, the best scholar, Lewis, became a wealthy planter of
		  acknowledged ability, cultivation and influence. A <choice><sic>nominanation</sic><corr>nomination</corr></choice>for Congress was tendered him by his
		  party, the Democratic, but he declined it. Charles B. Shepard, next to him, was
		  a member of the State Legislature and a Representative in Congress, dying at
		  the early age of 37; Lea was a Tutor in the University, then a minister of the
		  Gospel and President of Jackson College, Tennessee; Nicholson was a lawyer in
		  Tennessee and held many honorable positions, including the Chief Justiceship of
		  that State's Supreme Court, and United States Senatorship; Lindsay was an
		  influential wealthy citizen of Greensboro, president of a bank and member of
		  the Legislature; Robert A. T. Ridley, of Oxford, became Speaker of the House in
		  Georgia and a member of Congress; Lewis Thompson was a wealthy and able farmer
		  of Bertie and prominent in the Legislature; Warren Winslow became a member of
		  Congress and, as Speaker of the State Senate, acted as Governor in 1854;
		  Thompson Byrd was a Tutor in the University and a minister of the Gospel;
		  Absalom A. Barr was also a minister.</p>
          <p>Of those who matriculated with these but did not graduate, was Calvin
		  Graves, a State Representative and Senator, member of the Convention of 1835,
		  Speaker of the Senate, and as such gave the casting vote for the charter of the
		  North Carolina Railroad.</p>
          <p>The report of the Acting President in 1828 was gloomy. The Faculty
		  should be nine, whereas four were lacking from this number. North Carolina and
		  the neighboring States had been explored in vain for competent Tutors, and
		  Professor Olmsted had been written to for them. The strength of the Professor
		  of Mathematics, Phillips, was waning under his arduous labors. Professors and
		  teachers generally are among the most laborious of men. They cannot be
		  deficient without being infamous, nor can deficiencies and blemishes fail to
		  expose them to reproach and scorn, if every imperfection be excluded by an
		  accurate, prompt and comprehensive knowledge of the abstract and scientific
		  analysis on which they are employed.</p>
          <p>The expected successor of Judge Murphey, chosen by the Philanthropic
		  Society as the orator of the Commencement of <pb xml:id="p318" n="318"/>1828, was
		  Alfred Moore, son of the Judge of the same name. He had been Speaker of the
		  House of Commons, but preferred private life and the companionship of books to
		  the storms of a political career. He was one of the early students, who reached
		  Chapel Hill after the doors of the University were opened in 1795, was faithful
		  to duty, and afterwards lived a useful and honorable life. It was a great
		  disappointment to the company that sickness prevented his filling his
		  engagement. His bust is in Gerrard Hall, the property of the Philanthropic
		  Society.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register</hi>praises the speeches of
		  the graduating class as free from the usual bombast and false ornament,
		  displaying sound sense and strong discrimination. Richard H. Battle was
		  pronounced the best scholar and had the Latin Salutatory. The next best, Henry
		  S. Clark, had the Valedictory. Then came John L. Taylor, with the French, and
		  Thomas P. Johnston, the Natural Philosophy orations.</p>
          <p>Henry I. Toole's subject was The Objects of Education; James D. Hall's
		  was Mental Philosophy; John L. Taylor's French speech was <foreign xml:lang="fre">Le Caractere et regne</foreign>of Louis Quartoze. There was a
		  debate between Edwin G. Booth and Edwin R. Harriss whether the Southern States
		  should turn their attention to agriculture. James N. Nesbitt and John P. Gause
		  discussed whether political parties, not founded on local interests, were
		  prejudicial to the strength of nations. T. J. Oakes advocated internal
		  improvements. The Valedictory by Clark was the last address by students.
		  President Caldwell, as was his habit, then delivered a feeling and wise talk to
		  the graduates.</p>
          <p>Of these, Battle was a life-long invalid, but strong enough to be
		  Secretary of a Life Insurance Company and Commissioner of War Claims against
		  the State, by the appointment of Governor Worth. He was often Commissioner (now
		  Alderman) of the city of Raleigh. He had a strong and original mind. Clark
		  reached the honor of a seat in Congress. Taylor was a physician of high
		  standing, and Johnston was a Presbyterian minister and missionary for
		  twenty-three years.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, J. S. Gatlin was a Surgeon in the U. S. Army,
		  killed in the Seminole war; Rev. Nehemiah Henry Harding, <pb xml:id="p319" n="319"/>
		  a Doctor of Divinity in the Presbyterian Church; Richard Caswell Gatlin was an
		  officer in the United States Army, then a Confederate States Brigadier-General
		  and Adjutant-General of North Carolina in the darkest hours of the Civil
		  War.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Master of Arts (A. M.) was conferred on Wm.
		  Glascock, M.D., of Virginia, and on John Hill Wheeler, afterwards the author of
		  Wheeler's History and Wheeler's Reminiscences.</p>
          <p>Ethan Allen Andrews remained at the University until 1828, devoting
		  himself to the close study of the ancient classics, in which he continued for
		  the rest of his life. In that year he accepted the position of the Professor of
		  Ancient Languages in the New Haven Gymnasium. A year afterwards he established
		  the New Haven Young Ladies' Institute, conducting it with success for five
		  years. He then took charge of a similar institution in Boston. Here he remained
		  until 1839, when having in conjunction with Soloman Stoddard published a Latin
		  Grammar, which met with favor among teachers, he returned to his home,
		  inherited from his father in New Britain, and devoted the rest of his life to
		  the preparation of school books. The following is a list of his books, besides
		  the Grammar mentioned: First Latin Book; Latin Reader; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Viri
		  Romæ</foreign>; Latin Lessons; Synopsis of Latin Grammar; Questions on
		  the Latin Grammar; Latin Exercises; Key to Latin Exercises; Cæsar's
		  Commentaries; Sallust; Ovid; Latin Dictionary.</p>
          <p>Professor Andrews was intellectually, morally and in manners a very
		  superior man.</p>
          <p>He died March 24, 1858, aged 71 years. His two daughters married
		  successively Prof. Edward D. Sims, a graduate of the University of North
		  Carolina in 1824.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>TROUBLESOME ESCHEATS.</head>
          <p>The Trustees were occasionally embarrassed by petitions from persons
		  who claimed that they were injured by escheated property vesting in the
		  University. One Mary Bell stated the pitiable fact that by twenty-five years
		  hard labor in keeping a public house she and her husband had accumulated some
		  property, the title of which under the law vested in her husband; that on his
		  <pb xml:id="p320" n="320"/>death without heirs half of the property devolved on the
		  University; that she was sixty years old and could not live on what the statute
		  allowed her. “I am a poor widow, citizen of a country whose policy and
		  well regulated government does not need the assistance of property drawn from
		  old age and infirmity, leaving me to starve, in order to support most valuable
		  institutions.”</p>
          <p>The minds of the Trustees were torn by the conflicting ideas of
		  natural pity and fiduciary duty. They finally concluded to invest the money and
		  pay the interest to Mrs. Mary Bell so long as she should live.</p>
          <p>They seemed to experience no difficulty in deciding another case,
		  which in our times would be considered hard. A free negro had a daughter, the
		  slave of another. He bought her, and she then became the mother of a boy. The
		  woman's father died without kin and intestate. His child and grandchild being
		  his personal property became the property of the University. They were ordered
		  to be sold. This sounds hard, but it was proved to the Board that they were in
		  the lowest stage of poverty and degradation and that it would redound to their
		  happiness to have a master. It must be remembered that slaves were considered
		  to be as a rule in a better condition than free negroes.</p>
          <p>One of the saddest claims which devolved on the University was that of
		  Governor Benjamin Smith, the first benefactor. In his old age he became surety
		  for a man who owed the institution, and the Trustees felt compelled to enforce
		  payment. There is on record a petition by him for extension of time, which was
		  granted. The tradition already mentioned that he was imprisoned has a modicum
		  of truth, but the detention was only for a short while and, as he himself says,
		  by the hard action of a lawyer, who was his personal enemy. The Trustees
		  released him as soon as the matter was brought to their attention. It must be
		  remembered, too, that ex-Governor Smith was hopelessly insolvent, and if the
		  University had released him from the debt, his other creditors and not himself,
		  would have reaped the benefit. All his valuable lands on the Cape Fear were
		  subject to the judgment obtained by the United States to make good the
		  defalcations of Collector Reid, for whom he was bondsman.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p321" n="321"/>
          <p>It may be well to give other cases, showing the working of the escheat
		  law.</p>
          <p>At a later date, 1852, a sale of an escheat on behalf of the
		  University created some local excitement. A lot on which was an old building,
		  once used as a school house, but then in ruins, had been for years claimed by
		  no one. The University attorney had it sold. The sum bid was one dollar. A
		  memorial signed by six leading men of the town stated that the school had been
		  closed because of sickness from a local cause, which had been removed, and
		  plans for its revival were renewed. But “there comes an agent of the
		  University who blasts the almost open blossom of our Hopes, thereby robbing
		  perhaps many a poor boy from becoming a useful and prominent member of society,
		  who might have been brilliant lights and added others to the many great
		  luminaries who claim the University as their Alma Mater, but now left without a
		  light must mope in darkness and ignorance.”</p>
          <p>After several pages of similar rhetoric it was stated that the
		  attorney found a bidder at one dollar, and took a conveyance to himself and
		  sold the lot to a widow for $80, who proceeded to tear down the house
		  and cut down the shade trees. Then the widow was threatened with a suit and she
		  made a moving appeal to the Trustees, stating that she was about to be ruined.
		  It does not appear that the pathos and eloquence of their petitions effected
		  their purpose. Indeed, the petitioners seemed to have made the mistake of
		  applying for a remedy after instead of before the alleged wrong was done. The
		  attorney (General Singletary) asserted positively that the people generally
		  applauded his conduct. The amount received by the University was only eight
		  dollars.</p>
          <p>In 1861 the Trustees were notified of a possible windfall of
		  distributive shares. Judge John M. Dick, a Trustee, while riding the Mountain
		  Circuit, wrote that Acque to geh, Wage to togutah, Jack Rabbit, To ga kee la
		  son Betsy, and 330 other Cherokee Indians living in Western North Carolina, had
		  died since the Treaty of 1836. The attorney of the Indians, William H. Thomas,
		  took out letters of administration on their estates, giving bond for
		  $33,400, and collected $54 for each of the deceased,
		  <pb xml:id="p322" n="322"/>and it did not appear that any return had been made to
		  the court. As the University realized nothing from this claim, it is to be
		  presumed that Colonel Thomas made a satisfactory explanation.</p>
          <p>A dissipated Freshman, Spencer Reeves, was dismissed in 1829 for
		  giving a drinking and card-playing frolic, and following it up on Sunday night
		  by illuminating his windows with bunches of lighted candles. It is sad to
		  chronicle that after some years he became so degraded from drink that he slew
		  his sister for refusing to give him part of her property and was righteously
		  hung for the crime—the only instance of an alumnus dying on the
		  gallows.</p>
          <p>J. S., who participated in the spree, was saved by his previous good
		  character and by taking the iron-clad pledges.</p>
          <p>At the same time four students were dismissed for going home at the
		  end of the session without permission which either had been asked for and
		  refused, or had not been asked for at all.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement in 1829, described as very brilliant, a new
		  feature was introduced. Representatives from the Junior, Sophomore and Freshman
		  classes competed in declamation.</p>
          <p>The orator before the two societies chosen by the Dialectic Society,
		  was Professor William Hooper, who returned to the University in 1825 as
		  Professor of Rhetoric and Logic, and three years afterwards was made Professor
		  of Ancient Languages. The contemporary chronicler says that he was a deep and
		  severe thinker, as well as profound and eloquent rhetorician.</p>
          <p>The best scholar among the graduates was Franklin L. Smith of
		  Mecklenburg, to whom the Latin Salutatory was assigned. Next was Richard R.
		  Wall of Rockingham County, with the Valedictory. Then were John Potts Brown, of
		  Wilmington, with an oration on Natural Philosophy; Sidney X. Johnston on
		  Geology, and David M. Lees on Ethics. Debates were had between James A.
		  Johnston and James E. Kerr on the question, “Is the backwardness of North
		  Carolina due to moral or physical causes?”; between Burton F. Craige and
		  Osmond F. Long, as to whether Daughters should be educated as well as Sons; and
		  between Thomas W. Dulany and Wm. Eaton, as to whether Europe was benefitted by
		  the Independence of Greece, while <pb xml:id="p323" n="323"/>Rufus A. Yancey and
		  Philip W. Alston wrestled with the great problem, whether in the aggregate the
		  Destinies of Europe were Beneficially Influenced by the French Revolution.
		  Richard M. Shepard of Newbern discoursed on Modern French Literature.</p>
          <p>The best scholar of the fourteen graduates, Smith, died in 1835 with
		  rising reputation as a lawyer. Wall was a physician of high standing, Brown was
		  a commission merchant of the firm of DeRosset &amp; Brown of Wilmington, and
		  Brown &amp; DeRosset of New York. Johnston was a physician and member of the
		  Convention of 1861. William Eaton was author of a valuable law book,
		  Attorney-General and Senator from Warren; Craige, who dropped his middle name,
		  was a Representative in the Congress of the United States and of the
		  Confederacy, member of the Convention of 1861, and as such offered the
		  Ordinance of Secession; Alston was an Episcopal minister and a poet.</p>
          <p>Among those matriculating with the class, but leaving before
		  graduation, may be mentioned Wm. Dallas Haywood, for years Mayor of Raleigh;
		  Henry A. London, a very influential merchant of Pittsboro; Cameron F. MacRae, a
		  prominent Episcopal minister of this State, of Georgia and lastly of Maryland;
		  James Bryan Whitfield, State Senator.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity fell on Rev. John Robinson
		  of Poplar Tent, and Rev. John McKamie Wilson of Rocky River, both of Cabarrus.
		  Besides being pastors of power, they were principals of excellent classical
		  schools.</p>
          <p>The Trustees present were Governor Owen, Dr. S. J. Baker, F. Nash,
		  John D. Hawkins, William Robards, John Scott, James Mebane, Dr. J. S. Smith,
		  Arch. McBryde, James Webb, Rev. Dr. Wm. McPheeters, Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon,
		  President Caldwell and Secretary-Treasurer Manly.</p>
          <p>The honorary degrees granted were as follows, on the Rev. Adam Empie,
		  President of William and Mary College, afterwards Rector of a church in
		  Richmond, Virginia, formerly of Wilmington, N. C., Doctorate of Divinity.</p>
          <p>The same degree on Rev. Cornelius Vermeule, of the Presbyterian Church
		  of New Jersey.</p>
          <p>The degree of Master of Arts on Professor James Phillips and Professor
		  Nicholas Marcellus Hentz, of the University of North Carolina.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1830.</head>
          <p>At the Commencement, on Monday evening there was a declamation by
		  James Lea, William Owen, Julian E. Sawyer, Wm. Smith, John S. Hargrave, Thomas
		  F. Jones, Solomon Lea.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday evening, the 21st of June, the speakers were James Grant,
		  J. DeBerniere Hooper, Wm. W. Spear, Jacob Thompson, Thomas S. Ashe, Michael W.
		  Holt, and James O. Stedman.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday, there were original speeches delivered by
		  representatives of the two Societies.</p>
          <p>The best scholar, to whom was given the Latin Salutatory, was
		  Nathaniel H. McCain. James W. Osborne was next, with a speech on Moral
		  Philosophy. Next came Cicero Stephens Hawks, whose subject was Influence of
		  Rewards Bestowed on Distinguished Characters. The fourth in scholarship was
		  John A. Backhouse, to whom was assigned the Valedictory. The fifth in
		  scholarship was Richard K. Hill, with a speech on Political Economy, and sixth
		  was Aaron J. Spivey, whose subject was “The Use and Abuse of
		  Parliamentary Debates.” The next honor men were George G. Lea, who spoke
		  on the Importance of Liberal Education to all professional men; then Mr. W. L.
		  Kennedy, on the Influence of Periodical Literature, and lastly came Rawley
		  Galloway, who discussed Design in the Constitution of Nature. Benjamin F. Terry
		  and William K. Ruffin debated whether the gold mines, recently discovered in
		  North Carolina and elsewhere, are attended with greater advantages or
		  disadvantages to our State and to the Union. There was evidently in the air
		  dread of inflation of the currency and diversion of labor from other pursuits,
		  as well of the evils of making haste to be rich.</p>
          <p>John H. Edwards and Elisha Stedman, both afterwards physicians,
		  discussed this question: “Could the United States maintain its
		  Constitution if the Atlantic Ocean did not separate <pb xml:id="p325" n="325"/>her
		  from Europe?” J. M. Stedman's thesis was whether there could be a
		  Permanent Government without Education.</p>
          <p>McCain removed to Mississippi, and was a highly respected and
		  successful planter. Backhouse had a strange career. He was of fine promise, was
		  a Tutor of his Alma Mater after graduation; then studied theology, teaching at
		  the same time. After being ordained a minister of the Gospel, he was deposed
		  for conduct unbecoming a minister, and died early. Osborne was a prominent
		  lawyer and Judge, member of the Legislature and of the Convention of 1861.
		  Hawks was Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church of Missouri. Hill was a
		  teacher of repute in North Carolina and Texas.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1830, Hon. John H. Bryan, who changed his home
		  from Newbern to Raleigh, chosen by the Philanthropic Society, was the orator.
		  The reporter described his effort as chaste and eloquent.</p>
          <p>The report of the President at the annual meeting of the Board in
		  December, 1827, deplores the falling off in numbers. This was attributed to
		  three causes: 1st, the establishment of Universities and Colleges in Virginia,
		  Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia; 2nd, to the financial stress and
		  unparalleled depreciation in the pecuniary resources of the people; 3rd, vast
		  efflux of population to the West.</p>
          <p>He also informed the Board that the Main Building was in ruins. It had
		  not been occupied for years. The materials were worthless, the work wretched.
		  The experiment of employing a Superintendent of Buildings not connected with
		  the University, at a salary of $20, was unsatisfactory. Prof. Mitchell
		  assumed the duties.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>PANIC OF 1825.—THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPLIED TO.</head>
          <p>The financial panic of 1825, with its sequelae, was in truth a fearful
		  blow to the University. The receipts from Western lands and payments for those
		  sold were largely cut off. The tuition receipts diminished with the number of
		  students. The debts to the banks, incurred for building the Old West and work
		  on the Old East and unfinished Gerrard Hall, were unpaid. <pb xml:id="p326" n="326"/>The Trustees thought that turning off Professors would destroy the
		  prestige of the institution, and therefore borrowed money to meet their
		  salaries. By 1830 the University seemed on the verge of ruin. Energetic steps
		  were necessary to avert it. The President of the Board of Trustees called a
		  special session to consider the matter. It was on the 21st June, 1830, at
		  Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>There were present, Governor Owen, Dr. Caldwell, Messrs. John H.
		  Bryan, Willie P. Mangum, Charles Manly, James Mebane, Alfred Moore, John M.
		  Morehead, Wm. Robards, John Scott, James S. Smith, John Witherspoon, D.D.</p>
          <p>On motion of Judge Mangum, a committee of seven were appointed to
		  draft an address to the Trustees, setting forth the urgent necessity for them
		  to meet in Raleigh on the 19th of July. Dr. Caldwell was directed to send by
		  express, that is, a special messenger, a copy to every Trustee within a
		  reasonable distance of Raleigh, and to the rest by mail.</p>
          <p>Considering the difficulties of travel in the hot July days, there was
		  a very respectable attendance, about one-third of the Trustees. Their names
		  should be held in remembrance. They were: Governor John Owen, Dr. Caldwell,
		  Messrs. George E. Badger, Thos. D. Bennehan, John H. Bryan, Duncan Cameron,
		  James Craven, Wm. Gaston, John D. Hawkins, Louis D. Henry, James Iredell,
		  Charles Manly, Alfred Moore, Willie P. Mangum, Angus McBryde, Frederick Nash,
		  Wm. Robards, Thos. Ruffin, Romulus M. Saunders, John Scott, Hugh Waddell, James
		  Webb, W. McPheeters, D.D. Of these, nine were residents of Raleigh, ten of
		  Orange, one of Fayetteville, one of Moore County, one of Franklin, one of
		  Craven, one of Kinston. None except those from Fayetteville, Moore, Franklin,
		  and Kinston lived more than one day's distance from Raleigh, and they only a
		  two-days' easy journey. It is possible that Messrs. Gaston and Henry were in
		  attendance on the Supreme Court. On motion of Mr. Gaston, not then a judge, a
		  strong committee, Messrs. Iredell, Cameron, Moore, Henry, Bryan, Webb, Robards
		  (State Treasurer), and Waddell, were appointed to report the debts and
		  resources of the University, and recommend a plan of relief.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p327" n="327"/>
          <p>The Committee, through Mr. Iredell, reported the next day the

            <p>And the Trustees will have 241 shares of Newbern Bank stock.
		  Estimating this at 60 cents in the dollar, its supposed value, the University
		  will owe about $10,000. Probably this might be paid by receipts of
		  western lands in two or three years, but it is not certain that the Banks will
		  wait so long. Besides, nearly $6,000 annual deficiency in the salaries
		  of the Faculty will be due.</p>
          </q>
          <p>The Committee therefore recommended that the General Assembly be
		  memorialized for aid until the lands in Tennessee can be sold.</p>
          <p>The report was concurred in, and Messrs. Ruffin, Cameron, and Gaston
		  were appointed to prepare and present the special memorial to the Legislature
		  as was recommended. It was drawn by Chief Justice Ruffin, and, like his
		  writings generally, is very thorough, strong, and comprehensive. It sketched
		  the action by the Legislature towards the University from 1789, and showed that
		  the only grant then of value that was available for its support arose from the
		  Tennessee lands, which came from the escheated warrants vested in the
		  institution. According to the last report of the agent, there were 106,051
		  acres, including the 20,000 acres given by Governor Smith and about 9,000 acres
		  by Major Gerrard. Sales had been made and bonds taken to the amount of
		  $71,081.24. It was deemed unwise to press the sales of more lands or the
		  collection of these bonds at present, because of the financial condition of the
		  country, and because the lapse of time is strengthening the University titles,
		  which so many are ready to attack or weaken in courts and in the Legislature.
		  The value of the unsold lands was estimated eight years ago at $240,642,
		  but that is probably high.</p>
          <p>The actual cost of the buildings belonging to the University was
		  $95,537.41, besides annual outlays for repairs. The Library
		  <pb xml:id="p329" n="329"/>and apparatus cost about $10,000, and are still
		  worth about that sum. Part of the debt arose from the necessity of providing
		  accommodations for the large number of students, from 150 to 200, whose health
		  was endangered by overcrowding. The money was borrowed from banks in which the
		  University owned stock to the amount of $37,500, for which par was paid.
		  The total debt amounted to $37,518.73. We now see that the stock should
		  have been sold, instead of contracting loans on pledge of the same, but no one
		  could foresee the rapid decline in its market value, and in the dividends. The
		  most careful and astute investors, and successive Legislatures, made the same
		  blunder. By the sales of stock at 75 and 80 recently ordered by the Board, the
		  debt has been reduced to $20,124.55. The Treasurer has on hand
		  $3,143.21, but of that, $2,790 is payable to the Faculty for
		  their salaries. There remains 241 shares in the Bank of Newbern, but they have
		  no market value, and the bank is not paying dividends.</p>
          <p>With ample resources in prospect, the actual income is nearly nothing.
		  The tuition fees have been fixed at $30 per annum, so as to meet the
		  wants of people of limited means. At the enlargement of the institution, nearly
		  200 students paid an amount sufficient to meet the annual expenses. From
		  various causes, chiefly the general distress for money, and the erection of
		  well-endowed colleges and schools, the number is diminished to about 80. The
		  Faculty consists of a President at a salary of $1,600, four Professors
		  at $1,400 each, and two Tutors at $400 each. The expenses may be
		  stated as follows:</p>

          <p>If the State will assume the debt to the banks, the deficit will be
		  $5,800.</p>
          <p>The Trustees have no means now available for meeting this
		  <pb xml:id="p330" n="330"/>alarming deficiency. It would not comport with the
		  dignity of the State to ask individuals to support a public institution, nor
		  would such an appeal be successful. The Faculty cannot be reduced without
		  seriously impairing the efficiency of the instruction and the prestige of the
		  institution. “By a slight exertion of the fostering care of the
		  Legislature, this Institution, demanded as well by the wishes as the welfare of
		  the people, may be revived. In the course of three or four years at the
		  furtherest, the decision as to its right to escheated land in Tennessee will be
		  rendered. If favorable, the prosperity of the University will be fixed beyond
		  the reach of mischance. If unfavorable, it must be, like the colleges of some
		  of our sister States, wholly dependent on annual appropriations, or close its
		  doors.”</p>
          <p>The memorialists venture to suggest that the General Assembly shall
		  pay the debt, and in addition grant a small appropriation for three or four
		  years, or else apply some of the bank stock owned by the State to the
		  extinction of the debt. If neither plan meets with favor, “it may then be
		  considered, whether it be wise and politic that the public should suffer its
		  own child and favorite Seminary to be overwhelmed by the interest accruing on
		  this large debt whilst a Literary Fund of a greater amount is lying in the
		  vaults of the Treasury, or deposited in the banks for their own use and
		  emolument.” It is suggested that a loan, without interest, be granted
		  from this Fund, enough to discharge the debt, say $21,000, and in
		  addition for three or four years supply the deficiency in the annual receipts
		  heretofore mentioned. But the Trustees will be compelled to accept a loan even
		  on the most disadvantageous terms, as they cannot meet the interest on their
		  debt, much less the instalments required by the Act of 1829 to be
		  paid.”</p>
          <p>As Chief Justice Ruffin was considered one of the ablest lawyers, not
		  only in this State, but in the Union, I give in his own language his opinion of
		  the value of higher education.</p>
          <p>“Your memorialists refrain from indulging in extended
		  reflections, though obviously growing out of the occasion, upon the vast
		  importance of education; its influence upon individual happiness; its tendency
		  to enlighten and purify the mind; to chasten and correct the evil passions and
		  propensities of our <pb xml:id="p331" n="331"/>nature, and soften the affections;
		  to enlarge the sphere of human action and promote enterprise and the arts;
		  multiply useful men and increase their capacity for usefulness; and in a
		  popular government to inform the community at large, and dispose them to
		  cherish, and qualify them to defend, their free institutions. All these
		  considerations address themselves so powerfully and directly to the
		  understanding, that every man, and much more every member of your honorable
		  body, must estimate its importance highly. In North Carolina every person, who
		  is old enough to remember when the University was not, must have observed, and
		  cannot but testify to the effects most salutary of its
		  establishment.”</p>
          <p>The memorial then shows that the University had graduated more than
		  460 of her sons, and about the same number had attended her instruction without
		  waiting to obtain degrees. “These seven or eight hundred alumni now fill
		  with honor to themselves and to the College, and with usefulness to their
		  country, most of her posts of distinction, trust, labor and responsibility, in
		  her Legislatures, her Judiciary, her professions, her schools, besides adding
		  greatly to the mass of general information caught from them in the intercourse
		  of Society and diffused through the body of our citizens. Many, who have sought
		  employment and homes in distant sections of the Union, make us favorably known
		  in sister States, adorn our character and their own, and, cherishing a grateful
		  memory of the land of their birth, thank God, that though they do not live in
		  North Carolina, they were born on her soil, and were educated under her
		  patronage.”</p>
          <p>Then follows a panegyric on the Professors and Tutors. “They are
		  able teachers, discreet governors, and kind friends of their pupils.” The
		  praises of Dr. Caldwell are so peculiarly adulatory as to suggest that, in the
		  opinion of the Chief Justice, the recently earned popularity of the good
		  Doctor, on account of his Carlton letters, falling in with the general
		  enthusiasm for building railroads, would win scores of votes for the
		  institution, of which he was well-nigh the personification. After a glowing
		  tribute to his character and pre-eminent services, his learning,
		  <pb xml:id="p332" n="332"/>piety, to his qualifications eminently suited and always
		  equal to his responsible station, to his enthusiasm for education, and the love
		  and respect of his pupils, to his repeated refusals of more lucrative positions
		  elsewhere, it is added, “The mind revolts from the thought that this
		  venerable and venerated Apostle of Science and Virtue, should in the natural
		  life of his frail body survive the child of his mental labors for thirty-four
		  years, that he should now be compelled to abandon the scenes of his studies and
		  usefulness through such a long course of time, and seek another abode, after
		  witnessing the downfall and ruin of that institution, which has thus engaged
		  his individual attention and from which he has shed abroad through the land the
		  lights of knowledge, of science, social duty, public virtue, private probity,
		  and Christian piety.”</p>
          <p>The memorial was adopted, and Governor Owen, as President of the
		  Board, was requested to communicate it to the General Assembly. Messrs.
		  Cameron, Henry, and Saunders were appointed to confer with the Select Joint
		  Committee of the General Assembly, with full power to act in place of the Board
		  in regard to financial relief.</p>
          <p>I now give the action of the General Assembly. The part of the
		  Governor's message transmitting the memorial of the Trustees, was in the Senate
		  referred to a select committee, consisting of Senators Speight, Askew, Hill,
		  Jones, Ward, Kerr, McKay, and Williams of Franklin. This committee, on December
		  24, 1830, made its report, accompanied by a bill without the second provision
		  hereinafter recited, giving the Legislature full power over the University
		  charter, property and instruction. That was inserted on motion of James J.
		  McKay, Senator from Bladen, afterwards Representative in Congress, a
		  Jeffersonian Democrat, who probably had constitutional scruples about the
		  State's aiding any institution not under its entire control. The amendment was
		  adopted by a vote of 35 against 26, those who voted in the negative being more
		  ardent friends of the University. The names of these minority Senators were
		  George O. Askew of Bertie, David W. Borden of Carteret, Abraham Brower of
		  Randolph, Pinckney Caldwell of Iredell, Samuel Davenport of Washington, John M.
		  Dick of Guilford, Edward <pb xml:id="p333" n="333"/>C. Graves of Sampson, John Hill
		  of Stokes, Edmund Jones of Wilkes, Jonathan Lindsay of Currituck, Clement
		  Marshall of Anson, Wm. B. Meares of New Hanover, Stephen Miller of Duplin, Wm.
		  Montgomery of Orange, Wm. D. Mosely of Lenoir, Caleb Perkins of Camden, Joseph
		  Ramsey of Chatham, Richard Dobbs Spaight of Craven, Gabriel Sherard of Wayne,
		  Henry Skinner of Perquimans, Wm. M. Sneed of Granville, Robert Vanhook of
		  Person, Edward Ward of Onslow, Wm. P. Williams of Franklin, Hillory Wilder of
		  Johnston, Louis D. Wilson of Edgecombe.</p>
          <p>After the adoption of the amendment, the bill passed the Senate by a
		  vote of 40 to 19, the peculiar friends of the University with the majority,
		  except Senators Dick, Hill, Lindsay, Marshall, Perkins, Ramsey, Sherard,
		  Skinner, and Wilder. Meares was absent. Of those who refused to accept the
		  amendment, Senators Dick, Meares, Spaight were alumni. One alumnus, Charles L.
		  Hinton of Wake, voted in favor of the amendment. All the Senate Committee were
		  against it except McKay of Bladen and James Kerr of Caswell.</p>
          <p>The bill passed the House by 70 to 48. It is evident that the
		  hostility of the Trustees was not foreseen, because we find with the majority
		  such friends of the University as Evan Alexander, Daniel M. Barringer, John
		  Bragg, Joseph A. Hill, Geo. C. Mendenhall, Spencer O'Brien, Thomas McGehee,
		  Council Wooten, Jonathan Worth, John H. Wheeler, Richard Allison, Bartlett
		  Shipp, Dr. Thomas Hill.</p>
          <p>Thus in response to the eloquent, wise and feeling memorial of the
		  Trustees, the General Assembly fed its child with a stone of striking
		  angularity and hardness. The Literary Board was required to lend the University
		  $25,000 for five years, with interest from date, on the following
		  conditions:</p>
          <p>First, that the sum loaned should be a lien on all the University
		  property, real and personal, in possession and to be acquired. The Trustees
		  should signify in writing their assent to this lien.</p>
          <p>Second, the Trustees must agree that the Legislature might thereafter
		  modify or alter the charter of the institution, so as to assume to the State
		  its management, and the possession and disposition of all property, real and
		  personal.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p334" n="334"/>
          <p>Third, the Trustees must discharge all debts having a lien on
		  University property out of the proceeds of this loan.</p>
          <p>At that time it was thought that the University was protected by the
		  decision of the United States Supreme Court in Dartmouth College vs. Woodward,
		  against the encroachments of the Legislature without the consent of the
		  Trustees. At this day, however, under the State's constitutions of 1868 and
		  1876, and the decisions of the Circuit Court of the United States and of this
		  State in analogous cases, it is settled that the University is a State
		  institution under legislative control. The Trustees of 1831, indignant at being
		  called on to turn over the University to the Legislature, and encouraged by a
		  prospective remittance of $7,500 from Tennessee, unanimously rejected
		  the loan. For immediate needs they borrowed $4,000 from the Branch Bank
		  of the United States at Fayetteville.</p>
          <p>Such was the pressure of the debt, that Col. Polk and Messrs. James
		  Mebane and James Webb, were appointed a committee to offer for sale the
		  unimproved lands of the University around Chapel Hill. If this had been done we
		  would now have blasted rocky old fields in the place of our beautiful
		  forest—with all the purchase-money gone. A small sum was realized by the
		  sale of the Preparatory School Acre. The school had been closed for over ten
		  years.</p>
          <p>An abortive effort was made to obtain funds by subscription for
		  finishing the new Chapel, begun years before. A committee was raised, but no
		  funds.</p>

          <head>THE OBSERVATORY.</head>
          <p>President Caldwell had always been fond of the Science of Astronomy.
		  It was on this account that, in 1813, as I have shown, he was called on to be
		  the scientific expert on the part of North Carolina in running the South
		  Carolina boundary line. He built on the top of his dwelling a platform, on
		  which he would take the Seniors in squads of three and four, and point out to
		  them the heavenly bodies. He erected in his garden a sun dial, which stood
		  until the invasion of the Federal cavalry. He also built two pillars, still
		  standing, covered with vines, their eastern and western faces accurately
		  showing the true North and south line in his day.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p335" n="335"/>
          <p>In 1830 he determined to erect a building in which he could use the
		  astronomical instruments bought by him in London. It was finished in 1831, and
		  he is thus entitled to the credit of inaugurating the first observatory
		  connected with an institution of learning in America, that of Professor Hopkins
		  at Williams College being in 1836. Dr. Caldwell's building was on the highest
		  summit of a hill north of the Raleigh road, near the village graveyard. The
		  structure was about twenty feet square, without a portico or entry hall, and
		  with a window in each of its eastern and western faces. Through the center was
		  a pillar of masonry on its own foundation, and on a circular disk on the top
		  was the Altitude and Azimuth instrument. A slit through the northern and
		  southern faces and through the flat top afforded a range of 180 degrees for the
		  Transit. The Altitude and Azimuth Telescope stood on a circular disk of
		  sandstone, which capped the pillar. It was protected from the weather by a
		  wooden structure, drawn backwards and forwards on a railway by a windlass and
		  rope. The adjacent trees were felled so as to command a view of the horizon.
		  The instruments used were a Meridian Transit Telescope, made by Simms of
		  London, an Altitude and Azimuth Telescope, also by Simms, a Telescope for
		  observations on the earth and sky, Dolland of London, an Astronomical clock,
		  with a Mercurial Pendulum, by Molineux. Besides these, which were stationary,
		  there were a sextant, by Wilkinson of London, a portable Reflecting Circle, by
		  Harris of London, and a Hadley's quadrant. With the Astronomical clock and the
		  Transit, President Caldwell, assisted by Professors Mitchell and Phillips,
		  obtained the longitude and latitude of the South Building, 79° 17’ W.
		  and 35° 54’ 21” N. This calculation was made in the
		  mathematical room in the South Building in the second story opposite the
		  well.</p>
          <p>Observations were made by President Caldwell and Dr. Mitchell and the
		  older Dr. Phillips for the longitude and latitude of various places, on
		  Eclipses and on Comets and other celestial phenomena. These observations have
		  been lost.</p>
          <p>This institution had a short life. The building was of bad materials
		  and fell rapidly to decay. After the death of Dr. Caldwell it became necessary
		  to remove the instruments. In <pb xml:id="p336" n="336"/>1838 the building was
		  destroyed by fire, tradition says, kindled by a student. The sound bricks were
		  used to build a kitchen for President Swain on the lot next to the Episcopal
		  Church. The site of the old Observatory is easily recognized by the fragmentary
		  bats and the cedars clustering around the shrunken basement.</p>
          <p>President Caldwell, while he was averse to debt and kept free from it,
		  had no propensity to accumulate money. He built the Observatory out of his own
		  funds, at a cost of $430.29½. The Trustees, however, reimbursed
		  him a few days before his death.</p>
          <p>After removal from the Observatory, most of the instruments were for
		  years unused. Dr. James Phillips and his son, Dr. Charles, thought that the
		  interior of the dust-covered telescope was a safe place for hiding valuables
		  from the incoming Federal soldiers. They accordingly deposited their watches
		  within its recesses. They underestimated the keen-eyed seekers for hidden
		  treasures. But the commanding officer was in love with the President's
		  daughter, and forced the lucky finders to disgorge.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>MRS. ROYALL.</head>
          <p>In this period an American woman, said to have lived among the Indians
		  as a captive, coarse and ignorant, Mrs. Anne Royall by name, was the authoress
		  of “Sketches of History, Life, Manners, in the United States, by a
		  Traveller.” In 1830 was published her “Southern Tour, or Second
		  Series of the Black Book.” She visited Chapel Hill the preceding year and
		  evidently was avoided by the Faculty ladies, as her pen was dipped into gall
		  when she wrote of her visit. Her first impression was unpleasant, as the inn
		  keeper's lady met her with the question, “have you no man with
		  you?” The University, she said, was in a most delightful situation,
		  sitting upon an eminence, in the midst of a handsome grove, but, to the
		  disgrace of the State, is under the influence of a woman, the President's wife.
		  She is ruled by priests, the priests are ruled by money, and she rules the
		  University. The institution, which cost so much money, is under the dominion of
		  “these she wild cats, a Priest loving woman, fleecing the last cent of
		  pocket money from the innocent, unsuspecting young men. Meantime they are ruled
		  by a rod of <pb xml:id="p337" n="337"/>iron by this she wolf. Not a step dare the
		  hen-pecked President take without apprising this tyrannical woman.” As
		  Mrs. Royall was leaving Chapel Hill, a tall, genteel young man stepped into the
		  stage. He had been dismissed, she said, for “smiling in church.”
		  The students, fine, manly looking young men, came to take leave of the
		  dismissed man. In the opinion of Mrs. Royall, he deserved a statue, and
		  “so would any man who would raise his voice against such hypocrites and
		  besotted fools.” “This young gentleman possessed more virtue and
		  honor than the whole posse of the Faculty, with Madam President to
		  boot.”</p>
          <p>The truth is, that the student was dismissed for bad behaviour at the
		  preaching in the village chapel on Sunday night, before the arrival of the
		  preacher. There was much noise, vociferation, laughter, and tumult. “The
		  house was turned into a scene of wild riot.” After the arrival of a
		  member of the Faculty, he persisted in ill-behaviour, conspicuously
		  disregarding the order of the place, was directed to leave the house, but
		  refused to obey. On the next morning at Prayers he interrupted the prayer by
		  scraping with his feet. He had repeatedly been guilty of disorder, and had
		  incurred the censure of the Faculty.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Royall was either a malicious, untruthful woman, or demented.
		  Mrs. Caldwell was a woman of talent, of polished manners, and excellent heart.
		  She naturally dominated and gave tone to the village society, but her husband
		  was distinguished for his independence of character and inflexible will.
		  Neither she nor any other human influence could dominate or lead him. I quote
		  from the bitterness of the slighted vanity of Mrs. Royall, because, although
		  long ago consigned to oblivion, her book was once the theme of amused
		  conversation. Her vitriolic satire on Chapel Hill ladies is really a high
		  tribute to their conservative feminine virtues. Notoriety-seeking,
		  “mannish” females could get no countenance from them.</p>
          <p>After leaving North Carolina, Mrs. Royall sojourned in Washington
		  City, where she engaged in writing vituperative books and edited a “Paul
		  Pry” newspaper, so full of scandal that she was arraigned and convicted
		  of the crime of being a common scold—“<foreign xml:lang="lat">communis
		  rixatrix</foreign>.” She was sentenced to <pb xml:id="p338" n="338"/>the old
		  common law punishment of being ducked in the Potomac, but, modern ideas being
		  against the infliction of this primitive rough penalty on a woman, the Court
		  was induced to substitute a pecuniary fine.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1831, the Freshman competitors were Julius C.
		  S. Bracken, of Caswell County; Thomas Pollock Burgwyn, of Craven County;
		  William H. R. Wood, of Alabama; Thomas G. Haughton, of Edenton; Pleasant
		  Buchanan, of Alabama; James B. Shepard, of Craven; John Gray Bynum, of Stokes
		  County; Addi Edwin Donnel Thom, of Greensboro.</p>
          <p>For Tuesday evening the Declaimers were James N. Neal, of Chatham;
		  William H. Owen, of Oxford; William N. Mebane, Greensboro; Julian E. Sawyer,
		  Elizabeth City; Thomas L. Clingman, of Surry County; Thomas W. Harris, of
		  Halifax; John H. Haughton, of Tyrrell County; James R. Holt, of Orange.</p>
          <p>Of the Class of 1831, numbering 15, the best in scholarship was John
		  DeBerniere Hooper, who spoke the Latin. The Valedictory was the next highest,
		  by Calvin Jones, of Tennessee. Next to him was Jacob Thompson. His subject was,
		  “Inducements to the men of talents to improve their powers.” Then
		  was Lemuel B. Powell, who spoke on “National Pride”; then Giles
		  Mebane, on the Most Effectual Means of Promoting National Wealth, and Thomas J.

		  James O. Stedman, on Christianity as a Civilizer; John H. Haughton, on
		  Christianity and Civil Liberty; Thomas F. Jones, on the Intellect of the North

		  Public Liberal Education?”; Samuel S. Biddle, on the effect of
		  multiplying Colleges on Education; Michael W. Holt, on the Community of

		  Honorary Distinctions in College expedient?”, by Stephen S. Sorsby and
		  Thomas E. Taylor; <pb xml:id="p339" n="339"/>“Is the character of the

          <p>These are the most pretentious Commencement Day exercises on record.
		  All had places on the programme except Doak and Grant, probably absent. Some
		  spoke twice, as seen above.</p>
          <p>The honor men did well in after life. Hooper was Tutor and then
		  Professor successively of Latin, of Modern Languages, and of Greek and French
		  in the University. Jones was a Professor in the University of Alabama and
		  Chancellor of West Tennessee. Thompson was Tutor, lawyer, Congressman from
		  Mississippi, Governor, Secretary of the Interior, Inspector-General of the
		  Confederate States. Powell was a physician of reputation. Giles Mebane was an
		  able and upright member of the Legislature, President of the Senate; Thomas J.
		  Pitchford a prominent physician and State Senator.</p>
          <p>Among other strong men was James Grant, a Judge of the Superior Court
		  of Iowa and a benefactor of the University.</p>
          <p>The only honorary degree was that of Master of Arts, conferred on John
		  Tate, of North Carolina.</p>
          <p>The Oration before the two Societies was delivered by Rev. Wm. Mercer
		  Green, Rector of the Episcopal Church in Hillsboro, of the Dialectic Society, a
		  graduate of 1818.</p>

          <head>NORTH CAROLINA INSTITUTE OF EDUCATION.</head>
          <p>During the week, on the 22d of June, 1831, an organization was made of
		  the friends of education into an association called “The North Carolina
		  Institute of Education.” A constitution and by-laws were adopted on
		  motion of Benjamin M. Smith of Milton, who explained the objects of the
		  Association in a highly interesting and appropriate address. Doctor Simmons J.
		  Baker, of Martin, was unanimously elected President, and Wm. McPheeters,
		  <pb xml:id="p340" n="340"/>D.D., of Raleigh, Rev. Wm. M. Green, and Hon. Frederick
		  Nash, of Hillsboro, Vice-Presidents. Dr. Walter A. Norwood, of Hillsboro, was
		  Recording Secretary, and Mr. Wm. J. Bingham, Corresponding Secretary. The
		  Executive Committee were Professors Mitchell, Wm. Hooper, and James Phillips of
		  the University. The Committee met and elected Hon. Alfred Moore, of Orange,
		  Orator for 1832.</p>
          <p>Lectures were appointed to be given at the Commencement of 1832, as
		  follows: On Imperfections in “Teaching in Primary Schools,” by
		  Prof. Wm. Hooper; on “Elocution, with Particular Reference to
		  Reading,” by H. S. Ellenwood, of Hillsboro; on “Lyceums and Similar
		  Institutions,” by James D. Johnson, of Oxford. The subject selected for
		  discussion was, “The Period Necessary for Preparing for
		  College.”</p>
          <p>The Corresponding Secretary was directed to obtain for the Institute
		  the “Annals of Education,” and five copies of the
		  “Educational Reporter,” afterwards reduced to one copy.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>TEMPERANCE SOCIETY—DR. MITCHELL'S ADDRESS.</head>
          <p>In the summer of 1829, some of the students formed themselves into a
		  Temperance Society. It had a marked effect in causing a decline in the drinking
		  of spirituous liquors. In 1831, Professor Mitchell delivered a very able
		  discourse before the University at the request of the Society. It was printed,
		  and the strength of his argument and the excellence of the style extended the
		  reputation of the speaker. By the kindness of a friend, I have a copy, and
		  quote a few sentences which vividly portray the downward career of the
		  drunkard.</p>
          <p>“It seems hardly necessary to state in detail how fatal are
		  habits of Intemperance to the poor wretch who has become their victim. Standing
		  perhaps high in the society of which he is a member, he finds the respect with
		  which an antecedent life of virtue, temperance, and integrity have been
		  rewarded, passing silently away, like the snows of spring beneath the influence
		  of the sun. The old, whose conduct used to show how highly they prized his
		  friendship, and the young, who were once so eager to exhibit evidence of their
		  esteem and regard, now pass <pb xml:id="p341" n="341"/>him by without more than a
		  cold and distant salutation. His opinions no longer have the same weight in
		  cases of doubt and perplexity. His neighbors think that a cloud has settled
		  down upon his judgment, and darkened that mental eye once so clear and keen. *
		  * * His affairs are involved in confusion and disorder, and either his schemes
		  are not laid with his usual sagacity, or the turns of accident or misfortune
		  are very much against him. He finds that he has lost a portion of his power for
		  both physical and mental exertion. His family appear melancholy and dejected,
		  and it is in vain that he wakes up all his wit and tries to revive their
		  drooping spirit. They used to meet him when he returned from a distance with
		  countenances lighted up with smiles and welcome home the protector, husband,
		  friend, and father. But the time comes at length when his wife and children no
		  longer rejoice at his return, but, as he approaches they stand silent; their
		  hearts wrung with unuttered sorrow, and turn away their eyes and refuse to look
		  upon the ruin and degradation of what was once so venerable and lovely. Oh, if
		  there be one thing beneath the circuit of the sky, of which there is any hope
		  that it will awaken the strong feelings of nature that are either asleep or
		  dead within him, and rouse him to one last despairing effort to shake off his
		  chains and regain his freedom, it is that distress of his family. But often, as
		  we know, even that is unavailing. The voice of the strong appetite he has
		  created is stronger than the voice of nature, and the mansion that has hitherto
		  been the abode of love and peace, becomes the very scene of his excesses, and
		  when his brain is heated to frenzy, the arm of violence is perhaps raised
		  against a woman—the wife of his bosom, or against those children, who
		  should be the object of his tenderest love. But why pursue the melancholy
		  story, the particulars of which from the unhappy frequency of their occurrence,
		  are but too well known to us all? Why speak of the ruin of his credit, the
		  wasting of his property, the quarrels (with his best friends, too,) into which
		  he is betrayed, when petulant and ill-natured through the effect of
		  intoxication? His friends deriving no pleasure from his society, at length
		  forsake him. His estate is squandered, and his children (because the wealth
		  that should have come down to <pb xml:id="p342" n="342"/>them from their ancestors,
		  is intercepted in its descent by the author of their being, whom the law of
		  nature that binds even the brute creation, required to be their friend and
		  protector), are driven away to seek their fortune in some foreign land or
		  distant shore.</p>
          <p>“The poor wretch himself feels at length the access of those
		  diseases, of which he has so long been sowing the seeds. The poison he has for
		  years been taking into his system operates decisively. He sinks beneath a
		  complicated load of disorders and infirmities—shall I say into a late or
		  an early grave? An early grave, inasmuch as he has but just reached the age
		  when the sober and temperate part of mankind are in their prime—a late
		  one also, for he has long since ceased to be useful in the world, and ceased
		  therefore to execute the office for which God created him, and for which his
		  life was prolonged from day to day.”</p>
          <p>“If the youth of a country be neglected, no matter what may be
		  its physical advantages, or the form of its government, its soil may be fertile
		  as the border of the Nile, its government monarchical, aristocratical, or
		  democratical, as you choose, that country, taken as a whole, will be poor and
		  wretched. * * * We may borrow the pen of Draco, and write the statute book from
		  end to end in letters of blood; we may crown the summit of every mountain and
		  hill with a gibbet and a prison—amidst all that apparatus of law and
		  justice, vice will present herself with a bold and unblushing countenance in
		  the most public places, and laugh the lawgiver and judge to scorn.”</p>
          <p>“The moral and religious education of the children of the
		  drunkard must be miserably neglected. How will he dare to assemble his children
		  about him to unfold and explain to them the distinctions between good and evil,
		  vice and virtue, with their eternal sanctions—recommend the one and warn
		  them to avoid the other—he whose conduct is an open violation of the laws
		  and morality and religion every day he lives?”</p>
          <p>“The mind in ancient days did not demand the application of
		  stimulants more than the body. The orators of Greece and Rome needed not those
		  aids to eloquence, which our modern statesmen and declaimers employ. To the
		  poet, the fervor of his own bosom—to the philosopher the regular and
		  natural operation <pb xml:id="p343" n="343"/>of his own vigorous and unclouded
		  mind, were fully sufficient for the production of those masterpieces of taste
		  and wisdom which have been the admiration of every following age. The lips of
		  Moses, the Jewish lawgiver—of David, the sweet singer of Israel—of
		  the holy and sublime Isaiah—of the Redeemer of mankind, were never
		  polluted by the products of distillation.”</p>
          <p>These extracts are given because Professor Mitchell is known to have
		  been a many-sided man in science, but it is less known that he possessed no
		  little literary ability. As said elsewhere, his reputation as a writer of
		  sermons and addresses was obscured by his monotonous and awkward delivery. It
		  is worthy of notice that he believed that the ancients did not use—did
		  not know how to make—distilled spirits, that the “strong
		  drinks” mentioned in the Bible, meant the products of simple fermentation
		  from honey, grain and substances other than grapes, and neither
		  “wine” nor strong drink were much stronger than cider or ale. He
		  states that our whiskey, brandy and other liquors did not influence the morals
		  and happiness of mankind earlier than the end of the reign of James I. of
		  England.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE DROMGOOLE MYTH.</head>
          <p>There is a notable tradition dating from this year. Peter Dromgoole of
		  Virginia came to enter the University in 1831. He was fond of card-playing and
		  of wild company. He was not a matriculate. He took offence at a remark of one
		  of the professors and refused to submit to further examination. After a few
		  days he disappeared and was never heard of afterwards. A story was started that
		  he was killed in a duel and his body carefully concealed. His uncle, Hon.
		  George C. Dromgoole, one of our alumni, an able lawyer, came to Chapel Hill and
		  for weeks investigated the case. It is said that he was satisfied that there
		  was no truth in the rumor. The room-mate of Peter, a very reputable man, Mr.
		  John Buxton Williams, of Warren County, in a letter to the press, stated that
		  he never heard of Peter's getting into a quarrel, and that he started from
		  Chapel Hill in a public stage. I conclude that he was ashamed to go home,
		  journeyed to what was then the turbulent Southwest, and <pb xml:id="p344" n="344"/>
		  was killed in a brawl or assassinated. A modern tradition originating within my
		  knowledge places the scene of his fatal duel on Piney Prospect, and asserts
		  that he was buried under a rounded rock on its summit. Certain stains of iron
		  in the rock are pointed out as drops of his blood, and a still later story is
		  that his sweetheart, Miss Fanny, hurried to stop the combat, arrived too late,
		  went into rapid loss of reason and health, and was buried by his side. The
		  spring at the base of the hill, where the lovers are said to have sat and
		  cooed, bears the name of Miss Fanny's Spring. This last story is embodied in a
		  short poem of merit by Mr. L. B. Hamberlin, an Instructor of Expression in this
		  University, and that of Texas, and published in our <hi rend="italics">University Magazine</hi>of 1892.</p>
          <p>The persistency of belief in student circles in the Dromgoole legend
		  and its accretions throws light on the growth of similar legends elsewhere and
		  in the times of old. It doubtless suggested to Edwin Fuller in his novel of
		  Sea-Gift to create a fatal duel in which De Vare was killed. Some credulous
		  young people unblushingly avow their belief that the rains and snows of
		  three-quarters of a century have not washed out Dromgoole's blood spots on a
		  rounded granite rock.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>GASTON'S ADDRESS.</head>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1832 the address before the two Societies was
		  delivered by Hon. William Gaston, chosen by the Philanthropic Society. It met
		  with public favor to a most extraordinary degree. It ran through four editions,
		  the first of 5,000, published by the Philanthropic Society, a second shortly
		  afterwards by LaGrange College. Alabama, a third by Mr. Thomas W. Whyte at
		  Richmond, Virginia, with a strong commendation by Chief Justice Marshall. It
		  was also published in part in various periodicals and entire in the
		  <hi rend="italics">North Carolina University Magazine</hi>of 1844. To satisfy
		  the popular demand, the two Societies in 1849 jointly issued a new edition.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable that when the public mind was inflamed peculiarly on
		  account of the bloody insurrection of Nat Turner in the preceding year the
		  orator should have frankly avowed himself an advocate of the ultimate abolition
		  of slavery, and that the <pb xml:id="p345" n="345"/>audience cheered the utterance.
		  “Disguise the truth as we may,” he said, “and throw the blame
		  where we will, it is Slavery which, more than any other cause, keeps us back in
		  the career of improvement. It stifles industry and represses
		  enterprise—it is fatal to economy and providence—it discourages
		  skill—it impairs our strength as a community, and poisons morals at the
		  fountain head.” This bold language did not weaken his standing in the
		  State. Six months afterwards, although a Roman Catholic, and the Constitution
		  contained a clause inhibiting men of that faith from holding office, he was, by
		  the General Assembly, elected a Supreme Court Judge. He accepted the office,
		  being persuaded that the clause was contrary to the Declaration of Rights and
		  therefore void. One cause of the popularity of the address was the eloquent
		  denunciation of Disunion and praise of the Constitution, at a time when South
		  Carolina threatened Nullification and many openly advocated Secession.</p>
          <p>The Graduating Class had 36 members and was notable for merit. The
		  honors were as follows: The best, Thomas L. Clingman, who had the Latin
		  Salutatory. Next, John Haywood Parker, who had the Valedictory. Thomas S. Ashe,
		  speaking on the Application of Steam to the Arts, being third, and James C.
		  Dobbin, on Mental Philosophy, being fourth.</p>
          <p>As a rule, the members were successful in after life. Of the honor
		  men, Clingman was a Representative in Congress, and a Senator, also prominent
		  in State legislation. He was, moreover, a Brigadier General of the Confederate
		  States. Parker was an Episcopal clergyman of power; Ashe was a Senator of the
		  Confederate States and Justice of the Supreme Court of this State. Dobbin was
		  an able member of the State Legislature and Secretary of the Navy. To this
		  class belonged Richard H. Smith, a sound lawyer, wise member of the
		  Legislature, and Delegate to the General Conventions of the Episcopal Church;
		  Cadwallader Jones, Solicitor for his Circuit and Colonel in the Confederate
		  army, and John H. Haughton, a very able lawyer, and efficient in the General
		  Assembly in shaping the legislation of the State.</p>
          <p>Among the non-graduates was the eminent physician, Wm. F.
		  <pb xml:id="p346" n="346"/>Strudwick, of Hillsboro. Of the matriculates of 1832,
		  Charles G. Nelms, of Anson County, after reaching the rank of
		  Lieutenant-Colonel, lost his life in the Civil War.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Master of Arts was granted to Rev. Jarvis Barry
		  Buxton, Rector of the Episcopal Church of Fayetteville, and Rev. Samuel Lyle
		  Graham, of Virginia.</p>
          <p>The second meeting of the North Carolina Institute of Education was on
		  June 19, 1832. Mr. Alfred Moore delivered the Annual Address according to
		  appointment. Rev. Dr. Wm. McPheeters and Messrs. Wm. Hooper and Wm. J. Bingham
		  were appointed a Committee to report on questions and subjects for the next
		  Commencement. Mr. James Grant, afterwards Judge Grant of Iowa, moved that a
		  Committee be appointed to memorialize the Legislature on the subject of Popular
		  Education. The motion was carried, and Wm. Gaston, Frederick Nash and David L.
		  Swain were appointed.</p>
          <p>The Institute adjourned until 3 o'clock, at which time was heard the
		  lecture on Primary Schools by Prof. Wm. Hooper. It met with such favor that it
		  was published in pamphlet form. He began by stating that good schools cannot
		  abound in communities where all are engaged in clearing and subduing new lands.
		  Then his first point was that the imperfections of our schools were due to the
		  circumstances of our youth, raised amid active toil and hunting and fishing,
		  and the slack discipline of parents. He was noted for his numerous
		  illustrations. I give a sentence or two as showing this, and also the nicety of
		  his scholarship. “Will it be wonderful if a youth sent from domestic
		  indulgences, should find school ungrateful and accuse his teachers of being
		  cruel, that he should recite with mournful recollections, and still sadder
		  forebodings, that awful Greek verb, <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="gre">tupto</foreign>, to beat,</hi>particularly in the passive voice,
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="gre">tuptomai</foreign>, I am under beating
		  now; <foreign xml:lang="gre">etuptomen</foreign>, I was under beating a little
		  while ago,</hi>and then the dismal future, <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="gre">tuphthesomai</foreign>, I shall be beaten</hi>—but above all
		  the tenses (denoting the imminence of his dangers), <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="gre">tetupsomai</foreign>, I shall be very soon beaten again.</hi>”
		  He then argues for more severe training, praising the father of John Adams, the
		  President, who, when his son was reluctant to learn Latin, put him to ditching
		  as a punishment.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p347" n="347"/>
          <p>A second injury to improvement comes from the employment of cheap
		  teachers and want of proper valuation of superior men. Due applause should be
		  given to the superior schools.</p>
          <p>The third cause of imperfection of primary schools is the scarcity of
		  able teachers. Among the deficiencies is the neglect of the common rudiments of
		  English education. Another is the omission of the greater part of the classical
		  course. A third defect is the want of spirit and energy in imparting
		  instruction. “The manner a schoolmaster should have is much of the
		  promptness, energy and decision of a military officer, giving the word of
		  command to a company of soldiers.”</p>
          <p>Another improvement in our schools would be the use of oral lectures.
		  Apparatus, maps, plans of sieges, etc., military engines, should be used; for
		  example, the line of march in one of Cæsar's campaigns in Gaul, the
		  columns of the two armies, and all the <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">testudos, vineae</foreign></hi>and battering rams which were
		  employed. The trustees of academies should provide such.</p>
          <p>The proper construction of schoolhouses should be attended to. They
		  should be built with an especial eye to the purposes to which they are to be
		  applied. Stoves should be provided instead of fireplaces. He states, that the
		  celebrated Round Hill in Massachusetts, and the Newbern Academy in this State
		  approach near to his <hi rend="italics">beau ideal</hi>of a schoolroom. He
		  then describes what he considers the best—with floor of brick laid upon
		  plank, to prevent noise, not omitting the small cell for confining the
		  unruly.</p>
          <p>Professor Hooper then gives some hints on female education, making the
		  criticism that some seminaries attempt too much. “The whole encyclopedia
		  of knowledge is embraced in the list of studies; and the young lady, by the
		  time she reaches her teens, is in danger of thinking herself grammarian,
		  geographer, astronomer, chemist, botanist, painter and whatnot.”</p>
          <p>He closes with a strong argument for the establishment of a
		  <hi rend="italics">Seminary for the Education of Schoolmasters.</hi>“We
		  have seminaries for training up physicians, lawyers and divines; even mechanics
		  learn their trades under the best masters. But that most important and
		  difficult business of fashioning the intellect, moulding the disposition and
		  wielding the nascent energies of <pb xml:id="p348" n="348"/>those who are soon to
		  be rulers of the world, is left to mere accident, or falls to the lot of the
		  most common and inexperienced characters.”</p>
          <p>“We know not how many young persons have been ruined or injured
		  by unskillful management at school.”</p>
          <p>The address shows that the author largely anticipated the ideas now
		  ruling the world of thought on the subject of education.</p>
          <p>In 1832, on the 21st of June, the Institute of Education had another
		  meeting. The Committee on Addresses and Questions for the meeting in 1833 made
		  their report, which was adopted. Joseph A. Hill, of Wilmington, was appointed
		  to deliver the Annual Address, James D. Johnston, of Oxford, to read a paper on
		  Lyceums, Rev. Frederick Nash, on A System of Elementary Schools for North
		  Carolina, Walker Anderson on “Exciting Emulation in Literary Institutions
		  by Rewards and Distinctions.”</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>PLEA FOR BALLS.</head>
          <p>Those acquainted with college life are surprised at the intensity of
		  earnestness felt in this microcosm, miniature world, over matters trivial in
		  the estimation of those who move in the greater world. An abstract of a
		  petition to the Trustees in 1833, signed by Christopher C. Battle, John H.
		  Watson and William P. Webb, written by Battle, will illustrate this. They were
		  a Committee appointed by a mass-meeting of students, for the purpose of
		  procuring from the Board of Trustees permission to use a room in Steward's Hall
		  for the Commencement Ball. The petitioners are “sensibly touched with the
		  delicacy of presenting their petition at so early a period (November 6th), but,
		  knowing not whether there will be another meeting of the Trustees before
		  Commencement, the strongest motives of policy constrain their sending it in
		  now, though stamped with the impress of prematurity.” The intellectual
		  improvement and gentlemanly accomplishments caused by dancing would justify a
		  special ball-room, and if the New Chapel were completed, they would have asked
		  permission to fit up the old Chapel for the purpose at their own expense. It
		  would be extreme presumption to argue the propriety of balls, since the
		  Trustees <pb xml:id="p349" n="349"/>“deduce conclusions from the wisdom of
		  experience.” No genius, however promising, can effect much in the present
		  enlightened era, destitute of the polished accomplishments.—Since on this
		  retired Hill of Science, we are precluded from the improvement of Society, we
		  feel an inevitable drawback upon our literary acquirements. As balls greatly
		  promote gentility, acquiescence in the petition is earnestly asked for. Waiving
		  all personal concern, we strenuously advocate its principles as promoting the
		  best interests of the institution, as enhancing the splendors of our
		  Commencements, and as contributing much, very much, to the gratification and
		  pleasure of the adored Fair, who honor us with their company on that universal
		  jubilee.”</p>
          <p>The Trustees could not stand against such eloquence. The Ball Managers
		  in their gratification concluded to send special invitations to all the great
		  men in the State. Young Battle (a brother of Judge Battle) wrote to the
		  Governor, Swain, a personal letter, asking him to attend the Ball, “in
		  order to give dignity and stability” to it. The Governor replied,
		  regretting that he could not attend, and suggested that “agility”
		  would be more needed than “stability.” Battle was so afraid of this
		  becoming known to the students, that he made his colleague, Judge Webb, promise
		  to keep the correspondence secret, which he did faithfully until after their
		  graduation.</p>
          <p>In 1833, Tutor John DeBerniere Hooper resigned his place in order to
		  become a teacher in the Episcopal School in Raleigh, which had been inaugurated
		  with great promise of usefulness, which however for various causes failed as a
		  school for boys, but afterwards as St. Mary's Girls' School became a power for
		  good. The Sophomore Class passed resolutions, which show the strong hold the
		  Tutor had on their admiration.. The letter of the Committee accompanying the
		  resolutions is such a characteristic specimen of the peculiar style which has
		  given the name of Sophomoric to a species of Oratory, that I quote some
		  sentences. In truth, no history of a University would be complete without
		  embalming a specimen of such euphuism. The praises, though grandiloquently
		  expressed, were well deserved.</p>
          <p>“In every day occupations Farewell has an awful and ill-boding
		  sound in it, but when we reflect that we are now about <pb xml:id="p350" n="350"/>
		  to be parted, and perhaps forever, with one who has labored so diligently for
		  our present happiness and future aggrandisement, and who, by his own example of
		  piety and virtue, has also pointed out to us the bright and glittering paths of
		  morality, we are constrained to transcend the usual cold formalities of
		  separation and bid you that word bearing in its aspect our true expressions of
		  grief in a valedictory letter.” . . . “Now since we are all in the
		  glow of youth and health, and have ample opportunity, let us take an
		  affectionate and deep-impressioned farewell, such a one as long-cherished
		  friends take when they part with the expectation of meeting no more on this
		  side of eternity. Working out the great course of Nature, some dire pestilence
		  may sweep across our country and fell you or us, and perhaps both; war and
		  famine may hurry us into oblivion, or an earthquake may submerge us; to part we
		  must, and whether we ever again shall meet is on the fluctuating tides of
		  chance, therefore let us part as convicts doomed to die, but not despairing of
		  hope. To the reckless and unthinking this may indeed appear more the outward
		  expressions of grief than the spontaneous emotions of sorrow-stricken hearts,
		  but they should recollect that we are about to bid adieu to him that has so
		  honorably conducted us through the Sophomore year, to him that has laid the

		  the scholar and the refinements of the gentleman. It belongs alone to the viper
		  to implant his fangs in the bosom that warmed him, but to a man who is endowed
		  with the finer sensibilities of his God, it belongs to repay in a two-fold

          <p>It was in 1833 that Messrs. Gaston and Badger gave the opinion that
		  the Board had the right to sell the “service tract” of Maj. Charles
		  Garrard, at the mouth of Yellow Creek in Tennessee, notwithstanding the wish
		  expressed in his will that it should be retained by the University. Colonel
		  Polk as attorney made the sale, $6,400 for the 2,560 acres, and
		  $2,000 of the proceeds was voted to the finishing of the new Chapel. It
		  was resolved, <pb xml:id="p351" n="351"/>that in order to manifest a grateful sense
		  of the liberality of the donor and perpetuate his memory of it, this building
		  be forever known as Gerrard Hall. Col. J. B. Killebrew, the late very
		  intelligent ex-State Geologist of Tennessee, informed me that the tract is not
		  of especial fertility, and that the iron deposits once reported to be in its
		  limits are of little value.</p>
          <p>In 1832 the list of attorneys for the University was revised. On
		  motion of Louis D. Henry the requirement of a bond was dispensed with, as being
		  unusual, and sometimes mischievous, because excluding superior lawyers, who
		  consider the requirement a reflection on their professional character. I give
		  their names as a matter of history. The numbers begin in the mountain
		  counties.</p>

          <p>While it is not known that this committee was favorable to removal, it
		  is certainly open to criticism that, with such wise Orange County trustees to
		  choose from as Judge Duncan Cameron, Dr. Joseph Caldwell, Judge Frederick Nash,
		  James Mebane, Dr. James Webb, Thomas D. Bennehan, Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon,
		  Alfred Moore, Judge Willie P. Mangum, Dr. James S. Smith, John Scott, Hugh
		  Waddell, all very active friends of the University, their county, more
		  interested than any other, had no representative.</p>
          <p>Most of the committee were often called on to visit Raleigh on private
		  or official business. Owen and Robards had recently resided there. Johnston was
		  a relative of the chairman, Iredell, and often visited him at his home in
		  Raleigh. Four of them, Dr. S. J. Baker, General Blount, Mr. Bryan and Mr.
		  Henry, removed to the capitol, and Dr. J. B. Baker was a relative of Dr. S. J.
		  Baker. Although a majority of these trustees might have been expected to favor
		  removal, the committee in December, 1833, reported that it was inexpedient at
		  that time. Notice was <pb xml:id="p353" n="353"/>given that it would be called up
		  at the next meeting, but the measure slept forever.</p>
          <p>There was a spirited discussion of this question between two
		  Seniors—Crenshaw of Wake, and Proteus E. A. Jones of Granville—at
		  the ensuing Commencement. It is said that Mr. Crenshaw of Wake, “applied
		  the lash” to Orange. He contended that Wake County would welcome the
		  University. He sarcastically remarked that no one in that county would get
		  votes by running about and telling the people that he would persuade the
		  Legislature to force students to work on the roads. This was probably aimed at
		  Joseph Allison, a Representative for that and other years, and often Senator,
		  whose reputation for saying things pleasing to the people was very high. Mr.
		  Jones of Granville, with much animation and ingenuity, vindicated Orange, and
		  opposed removal. The question was not brought again before the Trustees. The
		  University was in such condition that all its energies were required to enable
		  it to stay in Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1833 was held without the presence of Dr.
		  Caldwell, whose health required a visit to Philadelphia. The strong man's
		  constitution was steadily giving away to the assaults of an incurable disease,
		  and the most eminent surgeons advised against lithotomy. The joltings over the
		  long rough roads gave him exquisite anguish, which he bore with the fortitude
		  of a martyr. Professor Mitchell, the senior professor, presided as his
		  lieutenant, at the request of the Trustees.</p>
          <p>The address before the Literary Societies was delivered by George E.
		  Badger, chosen by the Dialectic Society, who had stood from early manhood among
		  the ablest and best in our State. It is said by the chronicler to show
		  “accurate and profound thought, strength and vigor of expression,
		  interspersed here and there with a caustic sarcasm forcibly applied.”
		  While this praise is well merited it did not meet with the success obtained by
		  that of Judge Gaston.</p>
          <p>John Gray Bynum carried off the first honor, and spoke the Latin
		  Salutatory. Junius B. King and Wm. N. Mebane were next and equal, and Mebane
		  drew the Valedictory. King took the Philosophical Oration, and Solomon Lea that
		  on Belles <pb xml:id="p354" n="354"/>Letters. The other honor men were Julian E.
		  Sawyer, Addi E. Thom and Wm. H. Owen, and to them were allotted the
		  Intermediate Orations. Wm. M. Crenshaw and Proteus E. A. Jones, as heretofore
		  stated, discussed the question whether the University should be removed to
		  Raleigh; Edmund Jones and Josiah Stallings wrestled with the problem,
		  “Will the Emancipation of the Slaves in the West Indies be
		  Beneficial?” and W. E. Kennedy and Henry I. McLin, “Whether the
		  Recent Revolutions in Europe Will Be Productive of Good to the Human
		  Race?”</p>
          <p>In after life Bynum was a very strong lawyer and influential in the
		  State Legislature, but missed high political preferment. Mebane was an able and
		  useful Presbyterian minister and King embraced the same calling, and held
		  similar rank in Alabama. Lea was in the front rank of Methodist preachers, a
		  tutor in Randolph-Macon College, President of Farmville Female Seminary, and
		  then of Greensboro Female College. Sawyer was likewise a minister, as well as
		  Thom. Owen was a much respected Tutor of Ancient Languages, and then professor
		  of the same at Wake Forest College. Edmund W. Jones was a State Senator, a
		  councillor of State and member of the Conventions of 1861 and 1865.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on Rev. John Avery, rector
		  of the Episcopal Church of Edenton, and Principal of the Edenton Academy, and
		  that of Master of Arts on Rev. Philip Bruce Wiley, a teacher, and also
		  Episcopal minister.</p>
          <p>Joseph Alston Hill, son of one of the Commissioners to select the site
		  of the University, William H. Hill, very early in life attained distinction as
		  full of promise of future usefulness, and was cut off before reaching middle
		  age. The speech delivered by him before the Institute of Education justified
		  his reputation, being full of wit, fancy, elegance, good sense. He described
		  with much effect his sufferings at the Preparatory School in Chapel Hill, and
		  pleaded for a more sparing use of the rod. The reporter however thought that
		  the number and appropriateness of his classical quotations proved that the
		  scourgings he had received had not been in vain.</p>
          <p>A lecture on Lyceums by Mr. James D. Johnston of Oxford,
		  <pb xml:id="p355" n="355"/>showed extensive research. The veteran editor, Col. R.
		  B. Creecy, states that Mr. Johnston was an uncommonly able teacher.</p>
          <p>Prof. Walker Anderson closed by giving his experience in the education
		  of females. It is unfortunate that this paper is lost.</p>
          <p>The North Carolina Institute of Education seems to have had no other
		  meeting. As Dr. Wm. Hooper was evidently a leading spirit, if not the promoter
		  of it, I conjecture that the distractions caused by the long, painful and fatal
		  sickness of his step-father, President Caldwell, withdrew his attention from
		  everything extraneous to his regular duties. It is notable that the professors
		  of chemistry (Mr. Mitchell) and of mathematics (Mr. Phillips), declined active
		  aid to it although they became members. It is significant that in 1831 the
		  Executive Committee were Messrs. Mitchell, Hooper and Phillips, and in 1832
		  Messrs. McPheeters, Hooper and Bingham. It was a brave effort, however, on the
		  part of its promoters. One hundred and thirty of the leaders of the State
		  became members.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1834, Prof. Mitchell presided, President
		  Caldwell still languishing with his painful disease. The newspaper
		  correspondent was enthusiastic over the improved behavior of the students. The
		  obstreperous plaudits, with which they used to deafen the audience, no matter
		  when in or out of place, were either omitted altogether, or exchanged for
		  judicious signs of approbation. The feeble health of the President was
		  sympathizingly commented on. His altered appearance presented a sad contrast
		  with the active steps and cheerful disposition, which once distinguished
		  him.</p>
          <p>The class was the last which graduated before the death of President
		  Caldwell. James Biddle Shepard was the best and had the Latin Salutatory.
		  Abraham F. Morehead was the next, with the Valedictory. Then followed David
		  McAllister, who spoke on Political Economy. Wm. Pugh Bond and Wm. Pinckney Gunn
		  were next and equal. Bond spoke on the Drama and Gunn on Astronomy. Samuel R.
		  Blake and Samuel Williams discussed the query whether a College Education was
		  essential to General Culture; Thomas Goelet Haughton and <pb xml:id="p356" n="356"/>
		  Thomas Jasper Williams, Whether Manufacturers would be beneficial to the South;
		  Henry Watkins Miller and Harrison Wall Covington, Whether Institutions for
		  Public Education should be under control of the State, and William Brown Carter
		  and Albert Gallatin Anderson, Whether a Medical Board would be of benefit to
		  North Carolina.</p>
          <p>Of the honor graduates, Shepard became a member of the General
		  Assembly and United States District Attorney. He was the nominee of the
		  Democratic party for the Governorship when Wm. A. Graham was elected in 1846.
		  He was a fine speaker, but too wealthy to undergo the drudgery of the bar.
		  Morehead, a brother of Governor Morehead, was Tutor of the University, wrote
		  some short poems of merit and was a promising lawyer when carried off by
		  pulmonary consumption in 1837. McAlister was also a Tutor, and then a
		  physician. Bond was a Judge and member of the Legislature in Tennessee, also a
		  preacher of the Baptist Church.</p>
          <p>Of those who gained no honors, Henry Watkins Miller was one of the
		  ablest lawyers and most eloquent orators in the State. He was elected to the
		  Legislature at the beginning of the Civil War, and died while a member.</p>
          <p>Of those matriculating but not graduating, Edwin Alexander Anderson
		  graduated at Yale, was an able physician, President of the State Medical
		  Society. A President of this University, now of the University of Virginia, was
		  named after him—Edwin Anderson Alderman. One matriculate—Wm. W.
		  Avery—lost his life in the Civil War, as will be hereafter described.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws, (LL.D.) was conferred on George
		  Edmund Badger, late Judge and afterwards United States Senator, on Thomas
		  Ruffin, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and on Levi Silliman Ives, Bishop
		  of North Carolina; that of Doctor of Divinity on Rev. Andrew Syme of Virginia,
		  of the Episcopal Church. That of Master of Arts on Samuel Smith.</p>

          <head>AID TO CALDWELL.</head>
          <p>President Caldwell's disease proved to be beyond the surgeons' skill,
		  and caused him excruciating pain the remainder of his life. Possessed of
		  remarkable fortitude, he did not at <pb xml:id="p357" n="357"/>once lay down his
		  accustomed work. In December, 1833, the disease had made such ravages on his
		  strength that for the first time he asked for help. At his suggestion it was
		  ordered that when the President was unable by failure of health to take a
		  personal and active part in preventing disorders in and among the College
		  Buildings and the vicinity, the professor of oldest standing should be
		  peculiarly vested with the responsibility and power to aid in the active duties
		  of the Presidency. Thus Elisha Mitchell was at first partially, and then
		  entirely, the acting President until the advent of President Swain.</p>
          <p>Although President Caldwell insisted on doing his part in instruction,
		  the Trustees determined to relieve him to some extent. On motion of Wm. Julius
		  Alexander, an Adjunct Professorship of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy was
		  created, with a salary of $1,000, soon raised to $1,240. The
		  Standing Committee of Appointments elected Walker Anderson to the Chair. The
		  house expected to be purchased from Thomas H. Taylor, that east of the
		  Episcopal Church, was promised to him.</p>
          <p>The following by-laws, regulating the conduct of students, were the
		  last proposed by President Caldwell, and they, together with that above
		  mentioned, in regard to the Senior Professor, show clearly his disciplinary
		  ideas.</p>
          <p>A mandate was laid on every member of the Faculty to be vigilant in
		  carrying out the laws of the College, and to report transgressions.</p>
          <p>It was declared to be a great object of the Trustees in assigning
		  rooms in the buildings to Tutors, that they should individually and unitedly
		  suppress disorders, not only in their own, but in all the buildings. They could
		  not be absent without permission of the President.</p>
          <p>The Tutors must go to their recitation rooms a reasonable time before
		  the bell rings and teach the whole hour, unless bell for dismission should
		  sound earlier.</p>
          <p>Among other provisions, after several years of entreaty on the part of
		  the Seniors, the vacation asked for by them of one month prior to Commencement,
		  was granted. This became the settled practice for years, to the great
		  satisfaction of those <pb xml:id="p358" n="358"/>who had speeches to prepare for
		  Commencement, and the delight of those to whom text-books were a torment.</p>
          <p>As Professor Wm. Hooper owned his dwelling and Prof. Anderson rented
		  one, they were allowed a commutation of $75 per annum, which was about
		  the rental of the best houses in Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>Our modern football has not unrivalled distinction of peril to life
		  and limb. The President reported that the favorite game of the students, known
		  as Bandy, or Shinny, was dangerous, especially if played with a round wooden
		  ball. The players were frequently knocked apparently lifeless and were
		  incapacitated for duty several days. The students themselves were once so
		  shocked that they voluntarily gave up the sport, but renewed it. It was so
		  firmly established by prescription that the Faculty doubted their power of
		  prohibiting it without the previous action of the Board, which action, however,
		  was not had.</p>
          <p>Rev. Dr. Wm. McPheeters, the Principal of the flourishing Raleigh
		  Academy, earnestly pressed raising the standard for admission into the
		  University. This was acceded to, and the following requirements were
		  enacted.</p>
          <p>In Mathematics, the whole of Arithmetic (Barnard's or Adam's) and
		  Young's Algebra to Simple Equations. In the Classics, Jacob's Greek Reader, the
		  whole of the prose; or Græca Minora and the latter part of Jacob's Greek
		  Reader; the whole of Virgil, and Cicero's Select Orations, except the
		  Philippics.</p>
          <p>The work of the Faculty was assigned as follows:</p>
          <p>President Caldwell to hear each week (if his health permit, and if
		  not, Professor Anderson to hear for him), three recitations; Professor
		  Anderson, six recitations; Professor Mitchell, eight recitations; Professor
		  Hooper, eight recitations; Professor Phillips, eight recitations; three Tutors,
		  each nine recitations.</p>
          <p>For the coming session the President, or Dr. Mitchell, was to appoint
		  three Tutors, temporarily, but from and after the 1st of January, 1835, the
		  Trustees were to appoint three, at a salary of $500 each. One should be
		  styled Tutor of Ancient and Modern Languages, one of Ancient Languages, and the
		  third of Mathematics.</p>

          <p>That there shall be three Tutors. One with a salary of $750, to
		  be styled the first or principal Tutor, to teach Latin and French. A second is
		  to teach Greek, and the third Mathematics. It has been found by experience that
		  the present salary, $400, is not sufficient to retain our best scholars.
		  Tutors, as a rule, must be educated by this institution. Weight of character is
		  of very great importance as well as scholarship, and this combination cannot be
		  assured for a length of time on so small compensation as heretofore paid. The
		  following scale is deemed best: A graduate who has never taught, $450; a
		  graduate who has taught one year, $500; a graduate who has taught two
		  years, $600. The regulations for the duties of Tutors to be as
		  heretofore adopted.</p>
          <p>The standard of Education in the best Northern colleges is higher than
		  in our University. It is recommended to advance to theirs' by degrees. If we
		  were to adopt those of Harvard and Yale, we would for a year have no Freshman
		  class. The Trustees were asked to confer the authority to fix the terms of
		  admission on the Faculty.</p>
          <p>Individual members of the Faculty submitted separate papers.</p>
          <p>The most elaborate and novel recommendation was by Walker Anderson, a
		  man of much experience, good sense and honesty of intention. He began by
		  avowing his veneration and respect for his colleagues. The defects he will
		  point out do not involve any censure on them.</p>
          <p>The first defect is the low standard of scholarship, not perhaps in
		  comparison with other colleges, but still certain. Our graduates in the large
		  majority of cases, carry with them the most slender and superficial knowledge
		  of what they studied. There are two causes for this. One is the deficiency of
		  primary schools. The second is the utter inapplicability of University
		  <pb xml:id="p360" n="360"/>discipline to the regulation of boys. Some half dozen of
		  the lower classes are stimulated by the hope of distinction, but the multitude,
		  unambitious, unconscious of the value of time and opportunity, and secure in
		  the panoply of college principles, are impenetrable to motives Professors can
		  present.</p>
          <p>The second defect is the nature of the discipline. This is moulded to
		  suit the needs of mere boys, and the necessary strictness is irritating to the
		  young men. Boys learning Latin and Greek and the elementary parts of
		  Mathematics, as is the case with our two lower classes, ought to be in school
		  under a master.</p>
          <p>The third defect is the isolation of the University. He believes that
		  a village has all the temptations and evils of a city, without the restraining
		  influence of an enlightened and Christian community.</p>
          <p>He might mention other defects, but these are sufficient to show that
		  a change should be made.</p>
          <p>What are the remedies?</p>
          <p>1. Better academical instruction.</p>
          <p>2. The subjection of boys to school discipline until they have
		  obtained probable discretion.</p>
          <p>3. A more elevated standard of scholarship, both in the Languages and
		  Sciences.</p>
          <p>4. That the students should be placed in the reach of an improved and
		  Christian society.</p>
          <p>5. That these objects be accomplished without adding materially to the
		  expense of the institution.</p>
          <p>It is proposed that the institution be divided into two departments,
		  “The Collegiate Institute of North Carolina” and “The
		  University of North Carolina.” The former to be located at Chapel Hill
		  under a Rector and three Tutors, and to be modelled after the high schools of
		  Europe and our Northern States. In this should be taught, under the most
		  improved school discipline the studies leading up to our Junior Class.</p>
          <p>2. The University should be located in a town, preferably in Raleigh;
		  its officers, four Professors, one to be President, namely, one of Mathematics
		  and Astronomy, one of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy, one of Moral Philosophy
		  and Political <pb xml:id="p361" n="361"/>Economy, and one of Belles Lettres and
		  Ancient Literature. There should be three classes, the course to occupy three
		  years. The Professors should be ready, if necessary, to teach in other
		  departments. It might be expedient, after awhile, to add a Professor of Law.
		  They should reside under the same roof with the students. The object should be
		  to have a University of the highest grade. The half grammar school and half
		  college which we have now, can never be different from the present.</p>
          <p>As to the expense—</p>
          <p>The present expenses for the teaching force is $8,560. The
		  officer to assist the President on account of his declining health receives
		  $1,240. When he is no longer needed the annual charge will be
		  $7,320. The tuition fees are about $3,000, leaving near
		  $4,500 to be provided from other sources. Under the proposed
		  arrangement, the salaries of the Rector ($1,200) and the three Tutors
		  ($600 each) will amount to $3,000, which would be discharged by
		  tuition fees of those receiving an elementary education. It might be best,
		  however, to employ an able Rector and let him receive all fees and be
		  responsible for all expenses.</p>
          <p>There would then be in the University proper, at Raleigh or elsewhere,
		  the President and three Professors. Let them receive $1,000 each, and,
		  in addition, the President have two-fifths of the tuition money, and the other
		  Professors to have one-fifth each. If there should be forty students, these
		  officers would receive about the amount now paid them. The charge on the
		  University would be about $4,000 a year, which is less than at
		  present.</p>
          <p>As to the Buildings—</p>
          <p>It is recommended that a part of the funds to be derived from the
		  Tennessee lands be invested in a building to contain four lecture-rooms, and
		  accommodations for 64 students, or have 50 students and rooms for the President
		  and his family. Such a structure would cost $10,000, and the rent of
		  rooms would pay 8 per cent on that sum. If the number of students should
		  increase, they might be provided for in the same manner, and so Professors and
		  students would be under the same roof.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p362" n="362"/>
          <p>In another letter Judge Anderson expresses the opinion that, if the
		  foregoing changes be adopted, there ought not to be any Tutors. The most
		  unlearned pupils require the best teachers. The Freshman and Sophomore studies
		  are taught with less efficiency by inexperienced preceptors than the more
		  advanced portions, and should have the most skillful teachers. The discipline,
		  too, is devolved upon young men, possessing no authority, nor weight of
		  character, with the students. The Professors ought to live among the students,
		  as at the University of Virginia. Professor Anderson closes his letter by
		  declining the proposition made to him, to give instruction in Natural
		  Philosophy, Astronomy, Moral Philosophy, Political Economy, Rhetoric and Logic.
		  He cannot attend to the business of two and a half Professors.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mitchell wrote that he was not furnished with such facts and dates
		  as would entitle his opinion to respect. He suggested that the Faculty should
		  correspond with other institutions, and report plans founded on information
		  gathered. It is possible that being the <hi rend="italics">locum tenens</hi>of
		  the President, he deemed it wrong to criticize the institution, which was the
		  product of the labors and thoughts of Dr. Caldwell.</p>
          <p>Prof. Wm. Hooper, of the Department of Ancient Languages, answered the
		  enquiries of the Trustees with much earnestness, especially directed against
		  the consignment of the two lower classes to Tutors. These contain thirty to
		  thirty-five members each, while the upper classes have only fifteen or twenty.
		  He described the Tutors as almost always recent graduates, without authority of
		  character and of scholarship, scarcely a whit superior to their pupils. It is
		  not to be expected that such novices—equals to-day and superiors
		  to-morrow—should command respect and enforce good order. The result is
		  the total prostration of good scholarship and considerable relaxation of
		  discipline. At present the whole instruction of three Professors, and the
		  partial instruction of a fourth, will be given to the Senior class. Of one
		  hundred or more University youth, about sixty-five or seventy are starved with
		  a meagre taste of knowledge, while the favored minority are stuffed even to
		  surfeiting. The experience of Northern Colleges, <pb xml:id="p363" n="363"/>which
		  employ numerous Tutors, is like that of our University. This statement is made
		  on the authority of Professor Stuart of Andover.</p>
          <p>Professor Hooper, in January, 1834, sent to the Committee of
		  Appointments a formal protest against the recommendation by the majority of the
		  Faculty of the immediate choice of a Professor of Rhetoric and a third Tutor.
		  The reasons for the protest may be inferred from the foregoing invective
		  against the Tutorial system and the neglect of classical instruction in the
		  lower classes. He closes by saying that he has done his duty in laying before
		  the Trustees the true state of his department. If the evil be not remedied, he
		  will feel himself absolved from the responsibility of attempting to make
		  classical scholars at this college and “resign himself to the
		  tranquillity of despair.” He asks for an Adjunct Professor to share his
		  labors.</p>
          <p>It would not be fair to the Tutors, most of whom were of ability and
		  high character, not to mention that Dr. Hooper, on account of ill health, often
		  took very gloomy views of his surroundings. Dr. Caldwell at this time informed
		  the Board that the Professor had been subject to another attack of hemorrhage
		  from the lungs, which was somewhat copious and continued for some time. He
		  recommended the appointment of a Professor of Greek, if possible, and thus take
		  one of the Ancient Languages from the shoulders of Prof. Hooper.</p>
          <p>The Professor of Mathematics, Rev. James Phillips, sent in a spicy
		  report and recommendation. He stated that he had been engaged in the business
		  of teaching for twenty-five years, the last eight of which at this place, and
		  though he had met with discouragements, he could not recollect a single case of
		  entire failure. After an impartial review of what had been effected here, he is
		  compelled to say that he has on the whole failed of his object. Some of the
		  causes, at least, may be traced to the following sources: 1. The bad method of
		  teaching in our schools. 2. The inexperience and incompetency of our Tutors. 3.
		  The low estimate placed on the mathematical sciences here and in the State. 4.
		  The obstinate determination on the part of some students to do as little as
		  possible. This might be obviated by refusing diplomas to them. 5. The oral
		  <pb xml:id="p364" n="364"/>examinations are too short, should be superseded by
		  written, and time given to those examined to collect their thoughts.</p>
          <p>With regard to the proposal to demand of matriculates an acquaintance
		  with Algebra, the following suggestions are made.</p>
          <p>The system which embraces the synthetic to the exclusion of the
		  analytic modes of instruction, is defective. 1. The analytic is more concise
		  and admits of greater amount and variety of instruction in a given time. 2. It
		  is more uniform, general and comprehensive. 3. It is the easiest and imposes no
		  unnecessary load on the memory. For this statement he quoted La Croix and La
		  Place. 4. The best treatises on Statics, Dynamics, and Physical Astronomy
		  abound with analytical formulæ, which would be unintelligible to those
		  unacquainted with analysis. 5. It induces the habit of investigation and
		  compels the student to think for himself.</p>
          <p>If it be objected that the <choice><sic>deficiences</sic><corr>deficiencies</corr></choice>
		  of our students are such that the standard ought to be lowered rather than
		  raised, it is answered that no increase of difficulty is intended; that this
		  University ought to enter into honorable competition with those who have
		  introduced analytical Trigonometry and Geometry, and that the interests of
		  society and not that of individuals ought to require not only the quantity but
		  the quality of instruction.</p>
          <p>He therefore recommends that there should be required for admission
		  into the Freshman class, the whole of Arithmetic, practical and theoretical,
		  and Algebra as far as Irrational and Imaginary quantities in Young's Algebra,
		  or a fair equivalent on the same subject in any other treatise. This would
		  place our University on a level with the most respectable institutions in our
		  country.</p>
          <p>In a report two years before this, Dr. Caldwell, with his accustomed
		  strength, urged that the Faculty might be allowed to employ and pay scholarly
		  men to attend the examinations. The plan of relying on Trustees had failed. Few
		  had for years come at all, and they had dropped in near the close of the
		  period. He tactfully suggested an <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">argumentun ad homines</foreign>.</hi>A very scientific person may
		  not be qualified to be a Trustee, and so one may properly be elevated to a seat
		  on the Board, who is very imperfectly, if at all, prepared to become an
		  inquisitor into the <pb xml:id="p365" n="365"/>scientific attainments of a student.
		  This point was thoroughly appreciated by the boys under examination, who well
		  understood that, no matter how wise they looked, gentlemen fresh from
		  attendance on the Courts or Legislature, were necessarily rusty on Greek roots
		  and differential co-efficients.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the presence of learned strangers would have a strong moral
		  effect on idle students. Having often been reproved by their instructors, they
		  become revengeful, deal in charges of oppression, partiality, prejudice and
		  even personal enmity. In this they encourage and fortify one
		  another—against authority, and are studious of open or secret methods of
		  evading or resisting the laws. They look on examinations only as other
		  instruments of oppression and unite together to set them at naught. A Faculty
		  may act with unexceptional prudence, and strive to maintain parental and
		  benevolent feelings in all their intercourse, and yet find it difficult to
		  prevent the success of the idle and dissipated, whose object is to precipitate
		  all into confusion and inefficiency. They have a need of reacting force from
		  without. This may be provided with incalculable effects by subjecting the
		  merits and demerits of students to examiners called in from society at large
		  throughout the State.</p>
          <p>At much length he argued in favor of having the vacations in the
		  spring and fall, when the weather is pleasant. “In the summer the eastern
		  students now become saturated with malaria. In the winter the students leave
		  their habitual protection for exposure on their journeys three to five or six
		  days, “through the storms of winter, and through mire and water, if the
		  weather be soft, but through ice and snow if it be cold.” The good doctor
		  even became poetical for once. The object of vacations is to allow the students
		  and members of the Faculty to restore tone and energy to the system languishing
		  with inaction, and to the mind worn with exertion unbalanced by that of the
		  body. To this is necessary daily activity with pleasantness and variety of
		  outward scenery. With this end in view, who of us would select the fiery ardors
		  of the summer solstice, or the chilling blasts or snows of mid-winter? Though
		  they seem illy sorted here, it is hard to avoid the repetition of those lines
		  which we all have so often heard:</p>
          <pb xml:id="p366" n="366"/>
          <lg type="poem">
            <l>“Who can hold a fire in hand,</l>
            <l>By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?</l>
            <l>Or wallow naked in December's snow,</l>
            <l>By thinking on fantastick Summer's heat?</l>
            <l>Ah no! the apprehension of the good,</l>
            <l>Gives but the greater feeling to the worse.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The student should have acquaintance with the society and the world,
		  which can be better had in the pleasant seasons.</p>
          <p>He urged other objections to the existing plan. One is that many
		  students, on account of the difficulty of traveling, remain at Chapel Hill,
		  peculiarly liable and often succumbing to temptation.</p>
          <p>He mentions with indignation the depredations of the villagers on the
		  woodlands of the University, and suggested the employment of a ranger for
		  stopping it.</p>
          <p>The part of the foregoing report in regard to the vacations was
		  referred to Messrs. Nash, Caldwell, Jos. B. Skinner, and D. L. Swain, who
		  recommended that the vacations should be six weeks long, beginning on the last
		  Monday of April and the first Monday of October of each year. The Board refused
		  to concur in the proposition, and also rejected the further recommendation that
		  the Commencements shall be held in the middle, and not at the end of the
		  sessions.</p>
          <p>Instead of employing experts, the Trustees were divided into five
		  classes, their duty being in rotation to attend the examinations, those
		  attending, not exceeding five, to be paid $1.50 per day for expenses. It
		  is needless to say that even this gilded bait did not often attract them. One
		  Committee was secured, who recommended that the pay should be $3.00 and
		  ten cents mileage, but the Trustees did not grant it.</p>
          <p>The President ineffectually urged that the Professors should hold
		  their office during good behaviour. In practice this has virtually been the
		  rule. In rare cases the Trustees acted on their legal right of dropping an
		  obnoxious Professor without specifying any misbehaviour.</p>
          <p>It is to the credit of the Philanthropic Society that, at this time,
		  under the leadership of strong members, like Richard B. Creecy, Haywood Guion,
		  Wm. B. Rodman, James B. Shepard, and Ralph H. Graves, it offered $1,000
		  as a contribution towards <pb xml:id="p367" n="367"/>a new library. They proposed a
		  room forty feet square, with six windows and three fireplaces. The finances of
		  the University did not allow the acceptance of the offer.</p>
          <p>A contract of sale of fifty acres of the forest, now called Battle
		  Park, was made with Prof. Wm. Hooper, which was cancelled on his leaving the
		  University. The large trees were mostly cut off under this contract. The white
		  oak trees were left to supply hogs with acorns. There are remnants of a stone
		  wall enclosure extending into the Park.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE HARBINGER.</head>
          <p>In 1834 there was published by Isaac C. Partridge, under the auspices
		  of the Faculty, a weekly newspaper called the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger.</hi>The terms were $3.00 if paid in advance,
		  $4.00 if delayed six months, the publication being conditioned on
		  obtaining six hundred subscribers.</p>
          <p>The objects of this novel enterprise, as stated in the Prospectus,
		  were very ambitious and patriotic,—“to diffuse literary information
		  with correct taste, to impress the importance of popular and academic
		  education, and explain the best methods discreetly but with independent freedom
		  of stricture; to discuss subjects on which it is important to enlighten the
		  public mind; to furnish events and circumstances occurring among ourselves,
		  that deserve notice; to exhibit science in popular form that will solicit
		  curiosity and be generally intelligible; to promote the cause of Internal
		  Improvement; and to give a competent portion of the political and religious
		  intelligence of the time, with studious exclusion of all party
		  character.”</p>
          <p>The opinion is expressed that the public had long expected such a
		  publication from the site of the University, “the express purpose of
		  which is to cultivate and diffuse valuable knowledge, such as is already
		  treasured up and is constantly increasing with the progress of the
		  age.”</p>
          <p>Fears are expressed as to the promptness of remittances, which was all
		  the more necessary, “as the enterprise will be wholly without profit
		  except the necessary remuneration to the publishers and his employees. A
		  periodical paper in all its movements must by the very terms run against time,
		  and every experienced and reflecting man knows the truth expressed by
		  <pb xml:id="p368" n="368"/>Dr. Johnson, that he, who enters the lists with time for
		  his antagonist, must toil with diligence not to find himself beaten. Every one
		  who favors the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger</hi>with his patronage we hope
		  will do it with presence of mind to the importance of fidelity in his
		  remittance. On this the establishment must depend for its support.”</p>
          <p>Then the publisher comes in with a modest disclaimer that he
		  “would not enlarge on the qualities of the proposed periodical even to
		  excite in the bosom of his fellow citizens a disposition to give it countenance
		  and support, lest while consulting that object, he might seem to expose himself
		  to the charge of making vain promises, or raise expectations too high to be
		  fulfilled. But that a paper of such a character, as perhaps has been already
		  imagined in the minds of his readers, is desirable in our State, he cannot but
		  think few will deny.”</p>
          <p>The prospectus closes with the request that all to whom copies have
		  been sent will not only subscribe for themselves, but procure subscriptions
		  from others. Moreover, the publisher naively asks all the papers in the United
		  States not only to copy it, but to act as agents to further its object. It is
		  dated January 26, 1833, and it was hoped to begin publication by the first of
		  the following June.</p>
          <p>We do not have a file of the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger,</hi>but
		  fragments of it were cut out and pasted in a book, from which we are enabled to
		  get a glimpse of its character. Judging from the subjects discussed and the
		  style, the mixture of humor and gravity, Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Wm. Hooper were
		  evidently the chief contributors. I give abstracts of some of the leading
		  articles.</p>
          <p>There is a very intelligent paper on “The Stars,”
		  suggested by the great fall of meteors on the night of November 13, 1833. The
		  writer suggested that they were “Terrible indications of
		  war—between certain members of the editorial corps in North
		  Carolina” (a Raleigh editor had recently felled another with a bludgeon),
		  or “the Legislature are going to have a stormy session,” or, by
		  their laws, “wage fatal war upon the best interests of their
		  constituents.” This ridicule was then useful, as many ignorant people
		  were really frightened. The article then treats, 1st of Lightning, 2nd, of
		  “Fire-balls or proper <pb xml:id="p369" n="369"/>Meteors,” 3rd, of the
		  Aurora Borealis, 4th, of Shooting Stars, 5th, of Ignis Fatuus, 6th, of San
		  Elmos. The first is pronounced the most dangerous of all. As to the Fire Balls,
		  after giving three hypotheses, the author believes in a fourth, that they are
		  terrestrial comets, which, becoming visible to us when in their perigeum, and,
		  electrified passing through the atmosphere, discharge their electricity with an
		  explosion that rends off part of their mass, and pass on. Shooting stars are
		  very common, but never so brilliant as on the morning of the 13th November,
		  1833. The author, however, thinks their number was exaggerated, as he saw only
		  one at intervals of two or three seconds, but greater numbers may have fallen
		  earlier in the night. Of the Aurora Borealis, he states that it was so
		  brilliant on the night of September 28, 1828, in Paris that the fire companies
		  turned out and drove furiously through the streets, thinking the city was on
		  fire. It is produced by “electricity in motion, we cannot tell why or
		  how.” Of the Ignis Fatuus, he says that he has been tempted to pronounce
		  it a delusion, but its appearance is too well authenticated to be doubted. The
		  chemist can form nothing like it. It is “like rotten wood, which
		  according to our theories ought not to be luminous, but it shines
		  notwithstanding.” There is a note here which resembles the style of Dr.
		  Mitchell laughing at the Professor of Ancient Languages. “The words
		  (Jack-o'-the-Lantern, Will-o'-the-Wisp) will afford to the future investigator
		  of the English tongue, when it shall have become a dead language, an ample
		  field for dissertation. If we may be allowed to substitute the signs of the
		  dialects of Greece for those he will use, we may suppose him to state that the
		  original form was Jackwithalantern, which became Ionice, Jackothelantern;
		  Doric, Jackomelantern; Attic, Jackalantern. He will also remark, that
		  Willwithawisp is altogether irregular, from an obsolete root, as Haireo makes
		  eilon in the second aorist.” San Elmo is a Spanish name for a meteor of
		  electric origin. When there were two the ancients called them Castor and
		  Pollux.<note anchored="true">1 NOTE.—Vulgarly called Fox-fire, i. e. Faux (false) and
			 fire.</note></p>
			 <pb xml:id="p370" n="370"/>
          <p>Another article, published April 24, 1834, strongly praises Tudor's
		  Travels in Mexico and the West Indies, as one of the best books of travels that
		  has been published at a period prolific in works of this kind. The critic,
		  evidently Dr. Mitchell, is rapturous over the magnificent scenery, “the
		  bold and salient outline, the close association of light and shadow” in
		  these countries. He jocularly adds that “it seems as though our country
		  were intended for the residence of a race of prudent republicans, who are to
		  raise fine crops of tobacco, wheat, corn, cotton, and rice; construct railroads
		  and dig canals; make good laws and steer the ship of state, driven and buffeted
		  though she be by a tremendous northeaster, in safety over the ocean of ages,
		  but that the improvised child of genius must be nourished and inspired amid the
		  happy valleys or on the wild rocks of Mexico.” The allusion to the
		  “tremendous northeaster” seems a prophecy of our terrible Civil
		  War, but, if Mexico has excelled us in children of genius, it is not at all
		  apparent. Nor can we assent to the snow covered peaks of our neighbors as being
		  superior to the grandeurs of Niagara Falls and the Yellowstone Geysers.</p>
          <p>Another editorial is entitled “A Meditation among the
		  Pines.” When the breeze blows through a forest of long-leaved pines, the
		  mind of the writer is moved to speculate on the beauty, the usefulness and
		  antiquity of the trees. There are botanists who believe that plants have
		  sensations of pleasure and pain analogous to those of man, “But though we
		  may indulge in these dreams in regard to a healthy and vigorous oak or hickory,
		  it seems difficult to extend them to the pines. Driving their roots into a mass
		  of arid sand, and with leaves just large enough to whistle and sigh with, but
		  not to be the means and seat of enjoyment, an old Pythagorean might be excused
		  for believing them the appointed abodes and prisons of all the misers who have
		  ever trod the earth—to look down upon the yellow sand and find in it an
		  image and likeness of that which engrossed their affections in other
		  days.”</p>
          <p>Changing the thought, the goodness of the Deity is discerned in this
		  most useful tree, covering what without it would be a worthless waste. It was
		  probably introduced on this continent <pb xml:id="p371" n="371"/>during the ages
		  when lived here the mammoth and the elephant.</p>
          <p>The excavations of the Clubfoot and Harlow Canal disclosed bones of
		  the great Mastodon, “part of which found their way to Dr. Jones' Museum
		  and a couple of teeth were sent to the University, it is believed, by Captain
		  (Otway) Burns.” Afterwards were discovered the jaws of a young elephant,
		  with teeth sound, which fell into the hands of Mr. Fulton, the late State
		  Engineer, who carried them off to Georgia. Mr. Lucas Benners, one of the few
		  men of North Carolina who understood the value of the marl beds, presented to
		  the University a “magnificent tooth of a full-grown elephant in good
		  preservation.” The Jones here mentioned was Dr. Calvin Jones of Wake
		  County. Fulton was a Scotch civil engineer, employed by the State at a salary
		  of $6,000 a year to make our rivers navigable.</p>
          <p>An apology is made for wandering from the pine. “The character
		  of this communication would be at variance with its title, if there were an
		  intimate connection between its first and latter part.” It is signed by
		  “N.”</p>
          <p>In another issue is given a description by Michaux of the method of
		  making tar, pitch, turpentine, and gas, the long-leaved pine being the chief
		  source. It is annotated by “N,” who states that illuminating gas
		  was made by letting melted rosin flow on anthracite coal. He predicts a great
		  future for the manufacture of oil from cotton seed, “when a little
		  additional perfection is given to the machinery for the separation of the outer
		  porous coat from the oleaginous seed,” a prediction since verified.</p>
          <p>There is a very vivid description of a storm off Hatteras by “J.
		  J. T.” Although professedly written on shipboard, if there is any truth
		  in the narration, it must have been detailed from memory. “Our mainmast
		  has gone by the Larboard, our rigging and sails, split into a thousand ribbons,
		  commingling together, are wildly streaming in the wind. Dismay and despair are
		  depicted on every countenance. . . . For sixteen days we have been driven at
		  the mercy of the winds and waves. . . . The beautiful and accomplished Miss
		  —— is among the <pb xml:id="p372" n="372"/>passengers . . . tossed upon
		  the roaring waves. Were she but safe I would willingly embrace the fatal
		  ingurgitating billow. If we are destined here to find a grave, may the same
		  wave receive us both.”</p>
          <p>There are several articles on “Rural Economy.” In them
		  Kenrick's New American Orchardist is highly praised, and much valuable advice
		  is given. Kenrick described 235 <choice><sic>vareties</sic><corr>varieties</corr></choice>of apples,
		  251 pears, 87 peaches, 20 nectarines, 19 apricots, 63 plums, 43 cherries, 56
		  grapes, and a number of almonds, currants, gooseberries, raspberries, etc. A
		  statement is made which may be new to some readers, that a graft on any stock
		  will keep pace in the changes it undergoes with the stock from which it is
		  derived. Part of a paper on the cultivation of the vine in Madeira, published
		  in Silliman's Journal, is given, in order to show that peculiarities of soil
		  and exposure even on the same farm must be observed, in order to obtain good
		  results.</p>
          <p>A very intelligent editorial, signed “N” (undoubtedly Dr.
		  Mitchell) gives the best methods of producing fire. After mentioning the old
		  method of rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, of striking a flint with
		  steel, and by the sunglass, he describes the phosphorous vial, into which a
		  splinter, with sulphur coating the end, was thrust and rapidly withdrawn. For
		  this, some ten or twelve years before, there was substituted Hertner's
		  Eupyrism, from Paris. This was a vial containing strong <choice><sic>sulphric</sic><corr>sulphuric</corr></choice>acid and a bundle of matches, the latter headed
		  with chlorate of potash and a little starch or sugar, colored with vermilion.
		  The fire was produced by contact of the acid with the potash and starch or
		  sugar.</p>
          <p>“Very recently a new fire apparatus has been introduced under
		  the name of Lucifer Matches.” The making of these is described, and the
		  prediction ventured that “this little apparatus appears to be superior to
		  and likely to supplant every other.” The writer does not mention the
		  “chunk,” or fragment of burning wood, which good housekeepers
		  covered up, when they retired to sleep, nor the perpetual fire kept burning in
		  old Rome by the Vestal Virgins, from which the citizens could obtain a spark
		  when desired.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p373" n="373"/>
          <p>There is an excellent article by the same pen on “Engraving on
		  Steel.” “N” explains engraving on wood, on stone, and on
		  plates of copper, a soft metal, and then shows how plates of steel were
		  softened by heating with iron filings and so became soft enough to be cut by
		  the tools of the artist, then hardened by heating with charcoal. This
		  interesting statement is made: “When the adherents of the Bonaparte
		  family wished to excite a feeling in their favor a few years since, some small
		  prints were brought into the market and sold at an insignificant price, well
		  executed on steel and exhibiting the appearance of Napoleon at the time of the
		  most remarkable events of his life—when yet a stripling he directed the
		  siege of Toulon, afterwards at the bridge of Arcola, in Egypt, passing the
		  Alps, at Tilsit, Austerlitz, Fontainbleau, and St. Helena.” I have one of
		  these prints, a bunch of violets, showing the features of the Emperor, Maria
		  Louisa, and their son.</p>
          <p>In a paper on Crocodiles much skepticism is shown about Waterton's
		  claim, that he rode on the back of an alligator into the water, twisting one of
		  his forelegs over his back as a bridle. It is suggested that it requires
		  enormous strength thus to handle the arm of the animal, and that the beast
		  would be more likely to sink in the mud at the bottom than to retain buoyancy
		  sufficient to float with a large man on his back. Quotations are, however, made
		  from Pliny, asserting that the Egyptians would mount a crocodile in the water
		  and when he opened his mouth thrust a club between his jaws, so that they could
		  not be closed, and thus easily capture him. Dr. Pococke, in his observations on
		  Egypt, places the locality of riding on land, not in the water.</p>
          <p>Of an article on Mathematics only the title remains.</p>
          <p>A very interesting discussion is given as to whether a vulture, in our
		  land called turkey buzzard, finds his food by sight or by scent. It had been
		  the general opinion, supported by the authority of the ornithologist, Wilson,
		  that it was by his very acute sense of smell, but in 1826 Audubon furnished for
		  Jameson's Journal an article, detailing some careful experiments which tended
		  to prove that Turkey Buzzards, at least, depend for the discovery of their prey
		  on sight. Charles Waterton, <pb xml:id="p374" n="374"/>author of “Wandering
		  in South America,” ridicules Audubon. He says, “I grieve from my
		  heart that the vulture's nose has received such a tremendous blow. . . . I have
		  a fellow feeling for this noble bird. We have been for years together in the
		  same country. We have passed many nights amongst the same trees; and though we
		  did not frequent the same mess, still we saw a great deal of each other's
		  company.” Waterton relies on the fact that a large serpent lay untouched
		  under thick trees, until it was putrefied, when the birds found it at once. He
		  thinks it strange that vultures, if they rely on sight, do not pounce down on
		  sleeping fowls, even on men, who in the tropics take their siesta in the open
		  air.</p>
          <p>On the other side, Dr. John Bachman instituted a series of experiments
		  lasting a month in order to settle the question. The professors of the Medical
		  College of Charleston were observers of his work. They all agreed that the
		  turkey buzzards of that region are guided entirely by sight.</p>
          <p>The critic of the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger</hi>was, however, not
		  satisfied. He says, “We cannot help suspecting that it will turn out at
		  last that the buzzard has both eyes and a nose, or at least nostrils. Nor can a
		  Charleston bird be considered a perfectly fair experiment, bred as he has been
		  in the smoke and steam of two or three thousand kitchens, and amid the offal of
		  a large city, and differing therefore from a buzzard inhabiting the fields and
		  forests of the back country, as much as the keeper of a dram shop does from a
		  thoroughgoing member of a temperance society. The former, if he be allowed to
		  apply his nose to the bung-hole of a whiskey barrel, can hardly tell what is in
		  it, while the latter will detect a man if he has been indulging in half a
		  thimbleful of beverage, at a distance of something less than a hundred
		  yards.”</p>
          <p>It is a little surprising that the writer, evidently Dr. Mitchell,
		  should call our vulture a buzzard. A buzzard is a species of hawk.
		  Turkey-buzzard is the correct name, according to Webster, Audubon, and
		  others.</p>
          <p>It is also surprising to see our learned Doctor using the following
		  language: “There is some room for the suspicion both in his (Waterton's)
		  case, and that of Audubon, that they <pb xml:id="p375" n="375"/>have studied the
		  art of writing a book of travels in the school of Gulliver, the Baron
		  Munchausen, Mandeville, and the renowned worthies of that class.” Knowing
		  Audubon as we do, we can hardly realize that a well-read and accomplished
		  scholar should suggest the possibility of his veracious description being
		  munchausenism.</p>
          <p>It appears that there was an article on Sound, but it is not
		  preserved. There is one on the economic uses of the long-leaved pine. Its
		  products were much sought after in those days when steam was not used or used
		  but little. The products are enumerated as lumber of various kinds, turpentine,
		  spirits of turpentine, rosin, tar, and pitch.</p>
          <p>A paper by J. Hamilton Couper on Rotation of Crops as adapted to the
		  Southern States, published in the Southern Agriculturist, is highly praised.
		  Much emphasis is laid on the statement that, “it is now ascertained that
		  a living vegetable does not merely leave in the earth a quantity of nutritious
		  matter that is not adapted to its own subsistence and support, but deposits
		  under the form of an exudation from its roots a quantity of vegetable
		  substance, upon which neither itself, nor any other plant of the same species,
		  can feed, but which is well fitted to become the sustenance of another of a
		  different kind.” This fact is now made available especially by our more
		  advanced farmers in the use of nitrogenized bacteria.</p>
          <p>The writer mentions that Dr. Sondley of Newburg District had
		  discovered that a “new and valuable indigenous grass,” (Leersia
		  Orizoides), is a good food for cattle, that it is found in the neighborhood of
		  Chapel Hill and recommends that it be tried on damp and cold lands.</p>
          <p>There is also an appeal for improved roads so intelligent that it
		  would delight the heart of Professor Holmes and the other advocates of similar
		  beneficent agencies in our day. The MacAdam process was preferred.</p>
          <p>It must not be supposed that the columns of the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger</hi>contained only scientific discussions.
		  “N” prints a love-poem, a valentine, a particular favorite of his
		  in “his days of fancy, youth and frenzy,” some stanzas of which he
		  still regarded as <pb xml:id="p376" n="376"/>very beautiful poetry. The authoress
		  was Miss Ella Trefusis. I give two verses out of eight as specimens:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>O man! how little dost thou know</l>
            <l>The sources whence our pleasures flow;</l>
            <l>O man! how little canst thou share,</l>
            <l>The soft refinements of the fair!</l>
            <l>Those heavenly nothings which we prize,</l>
            <l>Your grosser appetites despise;</l>
            <l>Never in your hacknied bosom live</l>
            <l>Those loyal sentiments which give</l>
            <l>A sacred character to love,</l>
            <l>And prove its mission from above.</l>
            <l>Alas! my every wish was thine;</l>
            <l>But the world shared my Valentine.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The following is possibly a good description of an engaged
		  couple—</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Think, Mellidor, on former days,</l>
            <l>Think on the thousand winning ways,</l>
            <l>By which my heart thou did'st obtain!</l>
            <l>The fond, fond look, the melting strain,</l>
            <l>The frequent letter, praises bland,</l>
            <l>This tenderly imprisoned hand;</l>
            <l>Full many an eve together past,</l>
            <l>Each eve more valued than the last;</l>
            <l>When by the sun's declining rays</l>
            <l>I dared the transitory gaze,</l>
            <l>Read in those eyes that flame divine,</l>
            <l>Now—felt but by thy Valentine!</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The last of the original articles which I notice are on the history of
		  the State. Searches, it was urged, should be made for documents. The
		  biographies of officers and soldiers should be written. The conduct of
		  Cornwallis' army during the invasion of 1780 and 1781 should be investigated.
		  Stedman, an Englishman and a Tory, says, that “at Halifax some enormities
		  were committed by the British, which were a disgrace to the name of a
		  man.” What were these enormities? What influence upon the American cause
		  by the fighting Quakers, the Highlanders, and the Regulators, should be looked
		  into, as well as that of the Tories of Rutherford and west Lincoln.</p>
          <p>Another valuable paper was on the counties of North Carolina,
		  <pb xml:id="p377" n="377"/>their date of erection and the origin of their names.
		  The statements are as a rule accurate, but as Williamson and Martin were
		  followed there are a few errors. For example, Northampton County was not called
		  after a county of the same name in England, but in honor of the Earl of
		  Northampton, father of Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington, Prime Minister.
		  Surry County was named after Lord Surrey, who opposed the American war, in
		  office under Rockingham. Surrey was afterwards Duke of Norfolk.</p>
          <p>These historical articles are over the pen name of “N,”
		  undoubtedly from internal evidence, Dr. Mitchell, as has been said.</p>
          <p>Besides the well-written and instructive editorials, there was the
		  usual supply of clippings, including useful facts and humorous anecdotes. Among
		  the facts is a statement that Harvard College in 1830, excluding buildings,
		  library, apparatus and grounds, had property amounting only to $460,624.
		  Of this amount only $149,171 was applicable to the universal use of the
		  college, the balance belonging to the theological and law departments, and
		  including the funds pledged to salaries and professorships, etc. The annual
		  expenditure for 1832 was $41,054; income, $40,962. In about
		  seventy years Harvard University has increased to near 6,000 students, over 500
		  teachers, over $15,000,000 of property, and an annual income of more
		  than a million dollars.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italics">Harbinger</hi>soon came to an end, doubtless
		  from want of pecuniary support, as has been the fate of all journals in North
		  Carolina, which appealed to love of knowledge and literature.</p>
          <p>Of a similar nature to the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger,</hi>the
		  <hi rend="italics">Columbian Repository,</hi>printed at Chapel Hill, was
		  projected in 1836 by Hugh McQueen. No specimen of it is known to exist.
		  Probably it expired with the first number. The unfortunate habits of the
		  otherwise gifted editor and the limited number of those likely to be interested
		  in his journal necessarily brought it to an untimely end.</p>

          <head>SALE OF TENNESSEE LAND WARRANTS.</head>
          <p>While President Caldwell was languishing on his couch of pain, the
		  bodily agony equalled by his grief for the distressed condition of the
		  institution he loved more than life, plans were maturing on the wise initiative
		  of Duncan Cameron, President of the Bank of the State, one of the shrewdest
		  financiers of his time, which ultimately gave the University an endowment and
		  filled her halls with students. This beneficent result came from the sale of
		  her land warrants and other assets in the State of Tennessee. The trials and
		  difficulties encountered in pushing these claims deserve a detailed
		  narrative.</p>
          <p>The grant of Carolina to the Lords Proprietors in 1663 and 1665
		  extended nominally to the Pacific Ocean, called the “South Sea” in
		  the charter, but of course as Great Britain became the owner only to the
		  Mississippi River, this river was the real western limit. By the acts of 1782,
		  1783, and 1784 of the General Assembly of North Carolina, the warrants for
		  lands granted to its officers and soldiers of the Continental Line were to be
		  located in a region in the western part of the territory, now the State of
		  Tennessee, called the Military Reservation, with the proviso that if sufficient
		  tillable land could not there be found, other unappropriated land could be
		  substituted. A land office was opened, afterwards known as John Armstrong's
		  office, for the entries under said acts, and also under the Act of 1783 for the
		  redemption of specie certificates, issued for the expenses of the war.</p>
          <p>In December, 1789, North Carolina passed the Act of Cession of the
		  territory of Tennessee to the United States, which was approved by Congress
		  April 2nd, 1790. The rights of the officers and soldiers were not forgotten.
		  The Governor of North Carolina was to have power to perfect their titles by
		  grants; rights of occupancy and pre-emption theretofore granted were preserved,
		  and all entries already made, which interfered with prior entries, might be
		  located elsewhere in the ceded territory. With these exceptions, the
		  sovereignty over this territory passed to the United States.</p>
          <p>In 1796 Congress admitted Tennessee into the Union, but
		  <pb xml:id="p379" n="379"/>the unappropriated lands were not ceded to the new
		  State. Tennessee, however, claimed that North Carolina's rights expired in
		  1792, for the reason that the time for procuring grants was by the act of the
		  North Carolina Assembly limited to that date, that there was no reservation of
		  the power to extend the time, and that all extensions of the time for soldiers
		  to claim their bounties made after 1792 were null and void.</p>
          <p>In disregard of this claim the General Assembly of North Carolina
		  granted extensions from time to time until 1801, when this body barred all
		  claims not presented by 1st of June, 1803. By an act of 1807 that of 1801 was
		  repealed and applications were directed to be made to the Legislature, and
		  warrants to issue only on its resolution. In 1819 the Governor, Treasurer and
		  Comptroller were made a board, vested with the authority reserved to the
		  Legislature in 1807.</p>
          <p>Before this Board of 1819 the University presented its claims for very
		  many warrants. A large number was allowed, laid before an adjudicating board
		  appointed by the State of Tennessee, allowed by them, patents issued, placed in
		  the hands of locators, and subsequently grants issued.</p>
          <p>Although the State had published the names of the Continental officers
		  and soldiers and notified them of the warrants awaiting their application, a
		  large number never came forward. Presuming that these delinquents had died
		  without heirs, the General Assembly, by resolution, in 1821 directed that a
		  number of undelivered and unclaimed warrants in the names of those entitled
		  should be delivered to the University. And in 1824, in order to stop the clamor
		  of the people of Tennessee that the flow of warrants was inexhaustible, the
		  Secretary of State was ordered to close the muster roll and make out warrants
		  in the name of the University for all the remaining non-claimants.</p>
          <p>Let us now see something of the course of legislation in Tennessee and
		  in Congress. In 1799 Tennessee asserted her right as a State, sovereign except
		  as to the powers vested in the United States, to all ungranted lands within her
		  limits, even those claimed by the United States. She asserted that the national
		  title was abandoned when she was admitted into <pb xml:id="p380" n="380"/>the Union
		  without expressly reserving that title, but as the claim was not allowed, she
		  refrained from opening a land office. In 1801 she confirmed all prior entries,
		  warrants, and grants already made and directed that Tennessee grants be issued
		  on such warrants. At the same time she prohibited by heavy penalties any
		  further action by North Carolina surveyors and entry takers. In 1803 Tennessee
		  appointed Judge John Overton as agent to make a “friendly explanation and
		  adjustment” of these differences with North Carolina. This resulted in
		  the Act of the General Assembly of this State of December 2nd, 1803, passed
		  subject to ratification by Tennessee, which was given, and of Congress, which
		  was not given. This Act gave Tennessee the function of perfecting title to
		  claims of lands reserved to North Carolina in the Act of Cession, subject to
		  certain restrictions, that which concerned the University being the exclusive
		  right retained by North Carolina to issue military warrants.</p>
          <p>In 1806 Congress, in a spirit of liberality and compromise, ceded to
		  Tennessee, subject to North Carolina's reservation in the Act of Cession, and
		  also to certain Indian titles, the rights of the United States to about
		  one-third of the State, approximately from sixteen to seventeen million of
		  acres, of which after satisfying all North Carolina claims to this section
		  there remained in 1838 about eight million acres. The United States retained
		  title to about one-third of the State. The boundary between the two
		  sovereignties was called “the Congressional reservation line.” It
		  began where the main branch of the Elk River crosses the southern boundary of
		  the State, thence due north to Duck River, thence northwesterly down Duck
		  River, nearly to Centerville, thence due west to Tennessee River, thence down
		  the Tennessee to the northern boundary of the State. In official reports the
		  area west and north of this line was estimated as 6,840,000 acres, of which
		  942,375 acres were granted by North Carolina previous to the Act of
		  Cession.</p>
          <p>As soon as the Act of Congress of 1806 was accepted by the Tennessee
		  Legislature, that State opened her land offices for satisfying the reserved
		  claims of North Carolina. The lands south of the French Broad and Holston
		  Rivers were excepted.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p381" n="381"/>
          <p>In 1811 North Carolina claimed the right to perfect titles to lands
		  west and south of the Military Reservation line, and sent a surveyor, Col.
		  Thomas Love, for the purpose. After he had surveyed about 50,000 acres, the
		  Tennessee Legislature, as heretofore mentioned, passed a prohibitory act with
		  heavy penalties on the surveyor and register, and disbarring and fining any
		  lawyer who should bring suit on such claim.</p>
          <p>North Carolina thereupon, in 1815, memorialized Congress, claiming the
		  right, and complaining of so much of the Act of 1806 as gave Tennessee 200,000
		  acres for colleges and academies. Of course Tennessee presented a counter
		  memorial. In this it was stated that the lands east and north of the
		  Reservation line had been exhausted without satisfying North Carolina's claims,
		  and Congress was requested to authorize these claims to be located in the
		  Military Reservation. Congress complied with this request and, by Act approved
		  April 4th, 1818, authorized Tennessee to perfect titles by grants to all
		  locations prior to the Act of Cession, and “also to issue grants within
		  said territory on all valid warrants of survey, interfering entries,
		  certificates, grants and locations, that had not been actually located or
		  granted east and north of the reservation line, and that were removable under
		  the North Carolina Cession Act.” In pursuance of this authority,
		  Tennessee in 1819 opened a land office, and the time for satisfaction of such
		  claims was from time to time extended until 1839. It was calculated that
		  3,567,801 acres were adjudicated after the Act of 1818 to meet these claims,
		  leaving to the United States between 2,300,000 and 3,300,000 acres, which were
		  ultimately, in 1846, donated to Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Another element of trouble was the claim of the Chickasaw Indians to
		  lands stretching from the Ohio River south into the State of Mississippi,
		  including the western part of Tennessee, which was recognized by the United
		  States by the Piomingo Treaty of 1786. By treaties in 1805, 1816 and 1818, the
		  Chickasaws ceded all their lands east of the Mississippi River. For the
		  territory north of the Tennessee River, the price paid in 1816 was
		  $12,000 a year for twelve years, of which $4,500 was
		  <pb xml:id="p382" n="382"/>paid in sixty days. For that west of that river,
		  Governor Isaac Shelby being the commissioner of the United States, there was
		  agreed to be paid $300,000 in fifteen annual instalments of
		  $20,000 each, besides presents, $7,000 or $8,000 worth, to
		  the chiefs. It is stated that three thousand Indians were present when the
		  treaty was negotiated. The Indian title being thus extinguished, there was no
		  further obstacle to the location and sale of soldiers' warrants within these
		  limits. Now, for the first time since Governor Smith's donation of 20,000 acres
		  in 1792, his beneficence became available.</p>
          <p>Still another complication arose from the frauds by the Secretary of
		  the State of North Carolina, James Glasgow, and the Registrars of the Land
		  Office in Tennessee, John and Martin Armstrong. The latter converted to his own
		  use large sums belonging to the State, for which an uncollectible judgment was
		  obtained and given to the University by the State. And moreover these frauds
		  created suspicions of false entries and such confusion of claims as materially
		  increased the hostility of Tennessee towards the just demands of the
		  institution.</p>
          <p>The Trustees of our University lost no time after 1819 in obtaining
		  their grants from the State of Tennessee. An opposition grew up, on account of
		  the magnitude of the University's demands, so fierce as to threaten the
		  adjudication of all remaining warrants. Judge Archibald D. Murphey and Hon.
		  Joseph H. Bryan, the latter an ex-Member of the United States House of
		  Representatives, were appointed to secure the interests of the institution.
		  Judge Murphey journeyed to Nashville, ascertained by private conferences with
		  the members and his attorneys the best possible terms, and asked for and
		  obtained permission to address the General Assembly. He spoke during the
		  working hours of two days. When he concluded, Felix Grundy proposed that
		  Jenkins Whitesides and James Trimble, who had in full the public confidence,
		  should be appointed commissioners to investigate and adjust the claim of the
		  University, with power to compromise disputes and to grant exemption from
		  taxation as asked for. The leader of the opposition accepted the proposition,
		  and it passed the Assembly.</p>

          <p>On August 26th, 1822, these commissioners came to an agreement with
		  Attorney Joseph H. Bryan, by which grants should issue upon the warrants owned
		  or acquired by the University, and that they should be exempt from taxation
		  until January 1, 1850. The University on its part agreed to transfer to East
		  Tennessee College, now University of Tennessee, twenty thousand acres, and to
		  Cumberland College, now University of Nashville, forty thousand acres, the
		  assignments being subject to contracts previously made for procuring and
		  locating the same. The University further agreed to warrant the title to 45,000
		  acres at $1.50 per acre, with interest, liability to end unless adverse
		  claims should be made by January 1st, 1831. This was duly ratified by the
		  Trustees of the University and the General Assembly of Tennessee.</p>
          <p>After giving to the Colleges of East Tennessee and Cumberland their
		  shares of the warrants then in hand, there remained to the University of the
		  1,823 warrants only 4,476 acres. The application to the General Assembly for
		  their location was refused, but Judge Stewart of the Circuit Court, on a suit
		  for mandamus, founded on the statutes in existence, instituted by James Trimble
		  for the University, ordered the Secretary of State to adjudicate them. It was
		  hoped that the Secretary would likewise under this decision adjudicate the
		  warrants of 1824 and subsequently, but he declined to do so until the question
		  should be passed on by the Supreme Court. Before that body the University was
		  represented by James Trimble, Felix Grundy and Alfred Balch, who argued in
		  vain. The application was rejected. Soon after this argument, ex-Judge
		  Trimble's valuable services were lost by his death, and ex-Judge Wm. S. Brown
		  was employed in his place.</p>
          <p>A special session of the Legislature being called, Judge Murphey
		  addressed a strong memorial to that body, which was supported by Mr. Brown,
		  whose speech was said by the Secretary of State to have been “the most
		  splendid effort of human intellect he had ever witnessed.” Mr. Crabb, the
		  counsel for Cumberland College, he wrote, was “as usual very
		  respectable.” Major Abram Maury (pronounced and often written Murray), a
		  representative, manifested his “usual zeal and <pb xml:id="p384" n="384"/>
		  honest independence” for the bill, and was ably sustained by Mr. Grundy,
		  also a member. The opponents, however, prevailed by a vote of 20 to 18.</p>
          <p>At a subsequent session, on application of the attorneys of the
		  University, a hard compromise was offered. In 1825, after much furious
		  opposition, an act was passed providing for a commissioner to adjudicate the
		  validity of all military warrants, presented to him by the University or the
		  East Tennessee or Cumberland College, not exceeding in all 105,000 acres, for
		  which certificates would be issued for land west and north of the Congressional
		  line, in 25-acre tracts, which should be sold, first to actual occupants at
		  fifty cents per acre, next to general purchasers at one dollar, and after a
		  limited period at fifty cents per acre, and lastly the residue at public
		  auction; one-third of the proceeds to be paid to the University, one-third to
		  the common schools of Tennessee, and the remaining one-third to the two
		  aforementioned colleges. Under this act the University received in cash
		  $15,002.68.</p>
          <p>I now proceed to show what was done by the Trustees in working this
		  mine, so full of difficulties and disappointments.</p>
          <p>The management of the Western lands was left to the Committee of
		  Appointments, Archibald D. Murphey and Thomas Ruffin being added, the other
		  members being John Haywood, Henry Potter and Wm. Polk, the Governor being
		  ex-officio Chairman, when present: Duncan Cameron was added in the following
		  year. In December, 1825, the Trustees denominated the committee, so increased,
		  as the Land Committee, and conferred on them full power “to adopt such
		  course in respect to the land claims as to them shall seem most beneficial to
		  the interests of the University.” Besides those already named, from time
		  to time until the creation of the Executive Committee in 1835, George E.
		  Badger, Thomas P. Devereux, James F. Taylor, William Robards, Charles Manly,
		  Wm. S. Mhoon, James Iredell, and Romulus M. Saunders, besides Governors Burton,
		  Owen, Stokes and Swain, were members. Ichabod Wetmore, agent in Raleigh, of the
		  Bank of New Bern, was appointed Secretary at a salary of $250 per
		  annum.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p385" n="385"/>
          <p>As Col. Wm. Polk often visited Tennessee, having large interests
		  therein, he was vested by the committee with power to employ agents on such
		  terms as he thought best. On August 5th, 1821, he made a contract with Col.
		  Thomas Henderson, Jr., late editor of the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Star,</hi>
		  of whom Governor Swain said “No citizen succeeded in conciliating the
		  warm regards of a greater number of personal friends than he.” He was to
		  procure evidence as to all persons who had served in the Continental line of
		  the State who had died without heirs capable of inheriting land. He was then to
		  lay the same before the Governor, Public Treasurer and Comptroller—the
		  Board of Adjudication appointed by the General Assembly of this State in 1819,
		  and if passed, then before the Board of Adjudication in Tennessee—the
		  Governor, Secretary of State, and Register of the Land Office. For compensation
		  he was to receive one-half of the warrants.</p>
          <p>Col. Henderson proceeded to his duty with alacrity and success. He
		  appointed sub-agents, agreeing to assign them part of the warrants, what
		  proportion does not appear, and on October 3rd was ready for a division. This
		  was done, leaving to the University warrants calling for 147,853 acres. Other
		  warrants besides these were subsequently realized, as will be seen.</p>
          <p>As an agent residing in Tennessee was necessary for locating and
		  selling the lands, Colonel Polk selected a man of ability and means, Samuel
		  Dickens of the county of Madison, post-office, Spring Creek, a recent settler,
		  who had been a member of the North Carolina Legislature from Person County and
		  a Representative in Congress in 1810-1817. To him in 1821 was given power
		  “to do all things to maintain, secure and preserve the rights and
		  interests of the University.” The appointment was fortunate, as through a
		  long-continuing agency he proved himself to be vigilant and wise. He had charge
		  not only of the escheated warrants, but of those given to the University by
		  Governor Smith and Major Gerrard. His compensation for locating the lands was
		  that usually given, viz., 16 2-3 per cent of the value of the lands surveyed,
		  payable in land. For selling, collecting and paying over, his commission was
		  <pb xml:id="p386" n="386"/>six per cent at first and afterwards ten per cent. In
		  locating, he had a partner, Dr. Thomas Hunt, a graduate of the University in
		  1800, the firm under the name of Hunt &amp; Dickens, having a numerous staff of
		  young men “in the woods.” In dividing in 1823 the lands given for
		  locating, the decision was “by lottery,” or as we say, by lot. For
		  the purpose of securing an equitable division all the lands were grouped into
		  two divisions, northern and southern, and each division into two classes; first
		  class being tracts worth $4 per acre, and second worth less than
		  $4 per acre. On May 3rd, 1823, Dickens estimates the $4 lands of
		  the northern division at $37,589 and those under $4 at
		  $46,314.75. The aggregates of the southern division he estimates at
		  $57,153 and $56,007 for the corresponding classes. Deducting 16
		  2-3 per cent from these amounts, the University had the prospect of realizing
		  $164,220, less six per cent for selling and paying over. The net
		  receipts of warrants subsequently acquired were in addition to this. A
		  dangerous obstacle encountered was the hunting up by speculators of heirs, or
		  pretended heirs, of the soldiers whose warrants were transferred to the
		  University. Expensive litigation became necessary. So satisfied were the
		  Trustees that the bulk of these new-found claims were fraudulent, and that they
		  were owned by speculators who paid a trivial sum for them, and moreover that it
		  was impossible to distinguish the false from the true, that they adopted a
		  resolution to yield to no claim, no matter how plausible. They determined to
		  interpose every objection, technical or otherwise. To this the kindhearted
		  Treasurer Haywood entered his protest.</p>
          <p>The instructions to the agent, January 21st, 1826, drawn by Judge
		  Murphey, show the precautionary measures adopted. The agent was ordered to
		  place a tenant on each tract, so as to make the statute of limitations begin to
		  run. If a squatter was already in possession he would be induced to leave, and
		  adverse claims should be bought in, the seller conceding the fact that they
		  were for the University. Suits should be compromised, if deemed advisable. But,
		  says the instruction, “let the suits remain on the dockets for several
		  years that speculators may be kept in the dark as to the true state of things.
		  Not <pb xml:id="p387" n="387"/>many suits will probably be brought if there be no
		  decisions. Speculators will anxiously wait and look out for the decision before
		  they adventure far.” As the University guaranteed the title to the
		  warrants assigned to the Tennessee colleges against all claims made prior to
		  1831, suits should be avoided by all safe means until 1832. As it had been
		  settled by the Tennessee courts that claimants were barred by the statute of
		  limitations on the lapse of three years from the “appropriation,”
		  if not of the “emanation” of the warrants, the agent was instructed
		  to ascertain from the counsel of the University the meaning of these terms and
		  to complete whatever was needed to make the statute begin to run. It was hoped
		  that they meant the issuing by the Secretary of State of North Carolina. If so,
		  the University was already safe.</p>
          <p>Three thousand dollars cash was sent Mr. Dickens to meet expenses of
		  various kinds, including counsel fees.</p>
          <p>The counsel of the University in Tennessee at that time were ex-Judge
		  James Trimble and Felix Grundy, partners, of whom Mr. Dickens wrote that Grundy
		  was the greatest orator and Trimble, the soundest lawyer; at other times
		  ex-judges John Overton and Wm. L. Brown, Jenkins Whitesides, Alfred Balch,
		  Pleasant M. Miller, George S. Yerger. Besides these, there were local lawyers
		  to attend particularly to suits in their respective counties. Wm. Washington
		  was one of them. The principal lawyer for the University of North Carolina was
		  Archibald D. Murphey, general counsel in this State and special in the State of
		  Tennessee. The Land Committee likewise retained Wm. Gaston and George E.
		  Badger, as general counsel in all suits in which the University should be
		  interested. After Gaston became Supreme Court Judge, Thomas P. Devereux took
		  his place.</p>
          <p>The lawyers concerned with the settlement of the land disputes were
		  men of the highest repute in the transmontane country. John Overton, born in
		  Virginia, younger brother of General Thomas Overton, Andrew Jackson's second in
		  his fatal duel with Dickinson, had been a judge of the Superior and Supreme
		  Courts of Tennessee, a man of soundest judgment, and noted as a real estate
		  lawyer. Jenkin Whitesides, a native of Pennsylvania, was a specialist in land
		  laws and had an immense <pb xml:id="p388" n="388"/>practice. James Trimble was born
		  in Virginia, lived for a time in Knoxville, and was a judge in the eastern
		  circuit. He moved to Nashville in 1813 and there practiced law until his death
		  in 1824. Trimble was the soundest lawyer. He taught law to some of the most
		  eminent men of the State, such as Samuel Houston, Wm. L. Brown and George S.
		  Yerger. Felix Grundy has a national reputation for oratory, second only to Clay
		  and Webster. Born in Kentucky, he distinguished himself in the legislature and
		  reached the dignity of a Judgeship of its Supreme Court. He settled in
		  Nashville in 1807 and at once attained a large practice. He was soon elected a
		  representative in Congress and was so ardent in support of the war of 1812,
		  that its opponents declared that it was brought on by “Madison, Grundy
		  and the Devil.” In 1829 he was elected to the United States Senate. He
		  was Attorney-General of the United States under Van Buren and again a Senator
		  in 1834 and until his death in 1840. He was a wonderfully successful criminal
		  lawyer. It is stated on good authority that he defended 165 criminals charged
		  with capital crimes, only one of whom was convicted and executed. There is a
		  legend that he once caused to be printed a false almanac in order to deceive
		  the jury as to a date.</p>
          <p>Pleasant M. Miller was also a native of Virginia. He settled in
		  Knoxville and was a Representative in Congress from that district. In 1824 he
		  removed to West Tennessee, and after twelve years of full practice was elected
		  Chancellor. His letters, notwithstanding that he wrote “I have went
		  there” and spelt cession with an initial S, show that he had a vigorous
		  and original mind.</p>
          <p>George S. Yerger's father, of Dutch descent, settled in Lebanon,
		  Tennessee. The son was a bright lawyer. He was Reporter of the decisions of the
		  Supreme Court of his State and its first Attorney-General. He removed to
		  Mississippi and was eminent there.</p>
          <p>Wm. L. Brown and Alfred Balch are not mentioned in Caldwell's History
		  of the Bench and Bar of Tennessee. Brown was afterwards a judge, and a very
		  able one.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p389" n="389"/>
          <p>At their meeting in 1823, the Board of Trustees ordered 25,000 acres
		  to be sold under direction of the Land Committee. The agent, Samuel Dickens,
		  executed the trust with faithfulness and sound judgment, except that, owing to
		  good offers made, he sold somewhat more than the number specified. His action
		  was approved. From time to time other sales were authorized. Previous to and
		  during 1824, 6,873 acres realized on credit $21,067. In 1825 were
		  bargained 7,560 acres for $22,802; in 1826, 11,180 acres for
		  $32,474; in 1827, 2,001 acres for $5,668; in 1828-'9, 4,273 acres
		  for $13,190; in 1830-'1, 6,260 acres for $18,383; and in 1831-'2,
		  6,103 acres for $17,831. A total of 44,207 acres for $131,415.10.
		  The price averaged a trifle less than $3 per acre. The land unsold in
		  December, 1832, was 112,602 acres.</p>
          <p>The sales were generally made on credit of one, two and three years,
		  with interest from date. The agent at the above date (1832) had collected
		  $52,436.71, leaving a balance due on notes of purchasers
		  $78,978.39. Including interest, the balance was $94,587.31.</p>
          <p>Of the cash there was paid to the University up to January 1, 1833,
		  $34,657.50, leaving $17,779.21 to be accounted for. This was
		  expended by the agent for the following items:</p>
          <p>1st. Commissions for selling, collecting and transmitting.</p>
          <p>2d. Compensation to agent for attention to suits.</p>
          <p>3d. General superintendence, etc., etc.</p>
          <p>4th. Locative interest in certain warrants not divided until sale and
		  payment.</p>
          <p>5th. Attorney's fees.</p>
          <p>6th. Taxes.</p>
          <p>7th. Drafts paid on order of the Committee on account of buildings at
		  Chapel Hill, $1,114.24.</p>
          <p>These drafts, $1,114.24, should have been added to the cash
		  paid the University. Doing so, we have receipts into the treasury of
		  $35,771.74, and the expenditures for realizing this amount
		  $16,664.97, i. e., about 32 per cent of the total.</p>
          <p>In January, 1832, the agent reported that there belonged to the
		  University, excluding the Gerrard lands—</p>

          <p>The “Resolution lands” were those ordered to be given the
		  University by resolutions of the General Assembly in 1821.</p>
          <p>The report of 1834 shows that there had been sold by the agent in all
		  47,077 acres, for $125,150.05. There had been collected and accounted
		  for $56,814.17, being $4,377.46 in addition to what was reported
		  in 1832. There still remained due the University $68,335.88, principal,
		  and a large amount of interest.</p>
          <p>Besides the receipts from the agent, there was had from the State of
		  Tennessee under the Act of 1825, as heretofore mentioned, $15,154.04
		  1-4, making a total in cash account of Tennessee lands $50,925.78
		  received into the treasury.</p>
          <p>With regard to the title of the University to the aforesaid lands, the
		  agent hoped that by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dunlap vs.
		  McNairy, the statute of limitations placed them beyond controversy.</p>
          <p>The Register of Tennessee became alarmed, on account of public clamor,
		  and stopped issuing grants on some of the “Resolution warrants.” It
		  was hoped that he would resume without further trouble. None of the warrants
		  for which grants were actually issued were included, nor was a tract of 2,551
		  acres about which was a suit with John Terrell.</p>
          <p>The tenants placed on the lands prior to 1826 for the purpose of
		  claiming actual possession by the Trustees, generally deserted in order to
		  settle their own lands. This caused the agent to make some sales to people of
		  no means, who would not otherwise have been accepted.</p>
          <p>There was pending one suit against East Tennessee College for 2,500
		  acres and one against Cumberland College for 640 acres, both brought before the
		  expiration of the guaranty, but it was confidently expected that there would be
		  no others. There were some other claims, however, which might give trouble,
		  <pb xml:id="p391" n="391"/>but it was recommended to be quiet until the seven years
		  limitation expired. The decision in Dunlap v. McNairy was popular with a large
		  majority of the people. George S. Yerger was one of the few lawyers who
		  understood the law correctly and was paid a fee for arguing the case.</p>
          <p>The foregoing statement shows the history of the escheated Tennessee
		  land claims up to the end of Caldwell's administration. The compensation to the
		  attorneys was in land and money. To Joseph H. Bryan and Archibald D. Murphey
		  were given $1,000 in money and warrants for 640 acres of land each. The
		  Tennessee lawyers were likewise usually paid both in land and money, but the
		  amounts to all do not appear. Judge W. L. Brown received $1,500 cash and
		  no land. P. M. Miller received $1,000 in money and a 640-acre tract. The
		  agent said that Miller thought his services worth much more. He expected the
		  Board to order Major Dickens to convey to him two tracts instead of one of
		  choice land, 640 acres each, and $1,000 in cash.</p>
          <p>I note that while Major Dickens praised Brown and Miller, he makes no
		  mention of the services of Balch. The Secretary of State, Graham, gives the
		  credit of the passage of the compromise largely to Judge Brown, after Balch had
		  been driven from the field.</p>
          <p>An interesting fact is that Balch counted confidently on the influence
		  of Andrew Jackson and John H. Eaton, United States Senators, who would convince
		  the members of the General Assembly that Congress would never cede the public
		  lands in Tennessee to the State, as long as the University claims were
		  unsettled. They were expected to be in attendance on the General Assembly.
		  Judge Murphey likewise regarded Jackson as friendly to the University. As Eaton
		  was a University man and was warmly esteemed by Jackson, who made him his
		  Secretary of War, it is probable that here we see an instance of the potential
		  influence of the alumni. The Secretary of State, Daniel Graham was also an
		  alumnus, having migrated to Tennessee from the county of Anson, and all his
		  influence was exerted in favor of his <hi rend="italics">Alma Mater.</hi></p>
          <pb xml:id="p392" n="392"/>
          <p>The suit in equity of Ivey against Pinson and Hawkins, brought out
		  clearly the point in the attack on some of the <choice><sic>Unicersity</sic><corr>University</corr></choice>titles. Ivey claimed that he was a soldier
		  in the Continental Line. Believing him to be dead without heirs, the University
		  obtained his warrant as an escheat, caused it to be located and sold the land
		  to Pinson, who sold to Hawkins. Ivey then brought suit against Pinson and
		  Hawkins, alleging that he was the soldier entitled to the warrant, and
		  therefore to the land located under it; moreover, that the doctrine of escheats
		  was not applicable to such warrants.</p>
          <p>The defendants contended that the University should be a party to the
		  suit, to enable it to contest the identity of Ivey; also to set up the defence
		  of the statute of limitations, 45 years having elapsed. It was also contended
		  that, as the proper authorities had passed the warrant, and invested the land
		  located under it in the University and its assignee, Pinson, it was prima facie
		  the property of Pinson's vendee, and if there were any grounds of relief it lay
		  in the emanation of the warrant under a mistake of fact, and the University
		  should be a party in order to contest the alleged mistake. It was claimed that
		  Ivey, if not barred by lapse of time, at all events could only get damages for
		  the value of the warrant, and a suit for damages should be in the common law
		  court, whereas this was in equity.</p>
          <p>The Chancellor strongly inclined to the opinion that the University
		  was a necessary party, but he would not order a dismissal of the suit at once.
		  As to the other point he doubted, but rather believed the complainant could not
		  get the land. He continued the case until the next term.</p>
          <p>Ivey had sold his claim to two speculators, who made it their business
		  to hunt up old soldiers or their heirs and buy up their supposed rights. The
		  agents and attorney of the University felt deep interest in the case, not
		  because of the value of the land in controversy, but because a swarm of
		  speculators were ready, if the plaintiff succeeded, to precipitate litigation
		  which would have been ruinous. In the lower court the plaintiff was successful.
		  The Supreme Court was divided. The Legislature authorized the Governor to
		  appoint a special judge to <pb xml:id="p393" n="393"/>untie the knot. The new
		  judge, Nicholas Smith, and Judge John Catron, afterwards a judge of the Supreme
		  Court of the United States, divided in opinion, and then Judge Andrew Whyte
		  came in and proposed to join Smith in the decision for the plaintiff. To this
		  the counsel for the University strenuously objected, because Whyte had not
		  heard the second argument. It required a threat of impeachment to turn him from
		  his purpose. The court directed a new argument, but Overton and Miller declined
		  to speak again. Then Andrew L. Martin was employed to file a written argument,
		  especially covering the evidence and facts in this particular case, rather than
		  the general principles so ably discussed by the other counsel. The decision was
		  against the defendants, who appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States.
		  Through the agency of Hon. Lewis Williams, Daniel Webster was employed for the
		  University, who, because the University was an institution of learning and of
		  moderate means, charged a retainer of only $200, to be added to in the
		  event of victory. I have been unable to find this case in the Supreme Court
		  Reports. Perhaps it was compromised.</p>
          <p>Col. Dickens wrote that he had seen enough to convince him beyond
		  doubt that all the large speculators in University claims wholly relied on
		  perjury, and hence the constant necessity of having agents to attend to getting
		  up counter-testimony and attorneys to cross-examine fraudulent witnesses. One
		  Hugh Moore, a preacher, was about to bring forty suits, when it was discovered
		  that by forgery and perjury he had been a long time committing frauds on the
		  United States Treasury.</p>
          <p>Nor were open enemies only to be watched and thwarted. One of the
		  University counsel, a man of eminence, had, because of the delay in the payment
		  of an additional $500, written him a disgraceful letter, threatening to
		  retire from the service of the University and hinting at the extent of mischief
		  he might do to her.</p>
          <p>And then, after sales were effected, necessarily on credit, payments
		  were slowly made, and it was dangerous to attempt coercion by suit. Not only
		  was hatred aroused which might and did find expression in hostile legislation,
		  but “judges were <pb xml:id="p394" n="394"/>ready to grant injunctions on all
		  imaginable allegations, even on plain notes of hand.” This accounts for
		  the slow collection, which forced the Building Committee at Chapel Hill to
		  resort to the banks.</p>
          <p>Such public prejudice was worked up by the speculators in military
		  warrants, that the Board of Trustees, in 1826, deemed it advisable to issue a
		  public defence. At their request one of their number, George E. Badger, then
		  thirty years old, who had just resigned his Superior Court judgeship, prepared
		  an able argument, which was printed in pamphlet form and distributed
		  extensively in North Carolina and Tennessee. The author contended that, with
		  but few exceptions, the adversaries of the University in these claims were not
		  the brave men who fought for their country, nor the children of such, but
		  greedy and cunning speculators. “From the Trustees the lands are sought
		  to be wrested, in order to minister to a restless speculation, stimulated into
		  action by grasping avarice, laying its plans of acquisition with coolness, and
		  bringing to their execution all the machinery of crafty villainy.” The
		  defendants, on the other hand, are the University and the Tennessee Colleges.
		  “By them the funds are destined for purposes of great public utility.
		  Without knowledge, exertions can not be made for our country with success,
		  either in the cabinet, the Senate, or the Field. Even war is a science in which
		  mind vindicates its superiority over brute force, and mere courage, the most
		  common of all possessions, is of little avail without genius to suggest and
		  skill to execute. These colleges are destined to fill our land with learning
		  and with virtue; and thus to give to our republican edifice both stability and
		  beauty. It is a purpose a wise man will aid and a good man approve. It awakens
		  <choice><sic>everey</sic><corr>every</corr></choice>generous emotion in its behalf, and leaves us
		  only unmixed abhorrence for those who are willing to sacrifice alike the
		  Soldier and the College; who are eager to defraud both valor and learning, and
		  are intent alone on the gratification of a cupidity, unjust in its origin,
		  rapacious in its extent, and reckless of everything but its own
		  aggrandizement.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Badger, however, spends his strength chiefly in showing that even
		  honest claimants—soldiers or their heirs, have no <pb xml:id="p395" n="395"/>
		  rights to which the University should yield its claims. The scope of his
		  argument is:</p>
          <p>1st. That the Act of 1782 was not a contract for future service, but
		  only a bounty, purely gratuitous. This mere donation could be withdrawn at any
		  time.</p>
          <p>2d. In 1783 a time was fixed beyond which there could not be
		  acceptance of this bounty. After various extensions, the General Assembly, in
		  1801, barred claims not presented by the 1st of January, 1803. By the Act of
		  1807, that of 1801 was repealed, and all applications were directed to be made
		  to the General Assembly, and warrants to issue only on their resolution. By the
		  Act of 1819, the Governor, Treasurer and Comptroller were made a Board, vested
		  with the authority reserved to the Legislature in 1807.</p>
          <p>3d. These commissioners ordered the warrants to issue to the Trustees.
		  The State of <choice><sic>Tenneessee</sic><corr>Tennessee</corr></choice>adjudicated and allowed
		  them and patents were issued and legal titles vested in the Trustees.</p>
          <p>“The claimants, heirs, or assignees of the officers and soldiers
		  ask either—1st, the value of the warrants as personal property, or, 2d,
		  that the Trustees be ordered to convey to them the lands on which they were
		  located. It is clear that the 2d can not be maintained. The claimant never had
		  any right to the particular land covered by the patent. But in order to gain
		  his case the claimant must have a superior equity. This he has not. The
		  sovereign offered him a gift, fixing the time in which he should apply. She
		  extended the time. Again he failed to apply. She for the third time extended
		  the time. She called on him to exhibit his claim to the Legislature. She then
		  appointed a Board to receive these claims. She had extensively published her
		  muster rolls for general information. Thirty years elapsed, and she was
		  justified in concluding that the claimant was dead without heirs or had
		  abandoned the bounty offered. She recalled it and gave it to an institution
		  intended to disseminate knowledge and virtue among her sons, and to enlighten
		  with wisdom and arm with rational valor her future statesmen and
		  defenders.” For thirty years the claimant slept upon his claim, neglected
		  every invitation, until his <pb xml:id="p396" n="396"/>State bestowed the bounty on
		  an institution willing to use it for public merits. Where is his equity? Shall
		  the fund never be available for the purpose of public benevolence or private
		  usefulness?</p>
          <p>Again, the question of right to these warrants has been determined by
		  competent authority. North Carolina, by compact with Tennessee, reserved to
		  herself the right to issue military warrants. having the right to issue, she
		  had the right to decide who was entitled. She established a Board to make this
		  decision. That Board adjudged certain warrants to the University. This
		  adjudication is the act of a sovereign State and can not be attacked in the
		  courts of another State. If Tennessee thinks herself aggrieved she must demand
		  redress of North Carolina and if refused she can resort to the Judiciary or
		  Legislative Department of the Union. The Courts of a State have no power over
		  controversies between States. And so the claimant's course is to apply to North
		  Carolina for redress, being restricted of course to application to her
		  Legislature.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the authorities of Tennessee have settled the question. A
		  board elected by her have adjudicated these warrants. “The two
		  States—the sovereign parties to the compact—have by solemn and
		  deliberate acts determined the right of the Trustees to these warrants. It can
		  not then consist with the dignity and honor of either, that private individuals
		  shall disturb what they have decided.”</p>
          <p>This defence of the University claims, and especially the high ground,
		  that they were really the claims of the State of North Carolina, was suggested
		  by two of the Tennessee law-years, ex-Judge Overton and Pleasant M. Miller. By
		  making the question a controversy between States, it was thought that Congress
		  would require its settlement before considering the further question of
		  surrendering to Tennessee the residue of the public lands within her limits. To
		  impress the imaginations of the people of Tennessee and their representatives
		  it was further urged that a prominent lawyer, preferably Judge Murphey,
		  appointed by resolution of the Trustees, and if possible of the General
		  Assembly, should visit the General Assembly at <pb xml:id="p397" n="397"/>Nashville
		  in the character of an envoy extraordinary and ask for a hearing.</p>
          <p>Mr. Miller fully sustained Mr. Badger as to the character of those
		  interested in the claims. “Companies of speculators are hunting up
		  claimants. They will swarm around the Legislature and procure some act
		  favorable to their views. Nashville is the focus of all the mischief. They are
		  backed by the mob, who sympathize with the alleged poor soldier cheated out of
		  his land. He is a stern judge who can stand up against the clamor. One of them
		  has given away, surrounded by men clamorous for bread.”</p>
          <p>The Secretary of the State, Daniel Graham, in a letter to Colonel Polk
		  in 1825, gives a vivid picture of the attitude of the public mind to the claims
		  of the institution. “You, who have seen us here in the fullness of our
		  democratic power and levelling spirit can form some idea of the difficulties to
		  be encountered in a conflict with occupant privileges and prejudices. There is
		  in the Legislature the strongest spirit of Radicalism. Propositions to permit
		  further location of escheated warrants are treated as ‘rank Toryism
		  against our sovereign rights.’ Balch, as counsel for the University, was
		  driven from the field, and it required seven weeks negotiation, with the aid of
		  Judge Brown's commanding genius, to patch up by a bare majority the compromise
		  of 1825. There was a grievous pelting of illiberal calumny heaped upon the Old
		  North State, its officers and friends, but they took it like a prudent
		  Israelite, looking more to the security of his usury than to the opinion of
		  men. The sounds of fraud, perjury, corruption, speculation, gentlemen's
		  children grinding the face of the poor, etc., etc., are still tingling in our
		  ears.”</p>
          <p>Graham advised that the Trustees should accept the terms proposed, as
		  they are the best that will be offered. Even this measure would not have passed
		  if the relief to the people south of the French Broad and Holston had not been
		  included. “Even if the University could ever succeed in getting the
		  fifty-five remaining warrants adjudicated it would be impossible to locate them
		  without including land already occupied, and as the Tennessee law authorized
		  compensation for improvements, the estimation <pb xml:id="p398" n="398"/>to be made
		  by neighboring occupants, little would be left for the University. Again, the
		  Compact under the Act of 1822 does not exempt from taxation the warrants
		  afterward acquired, and so rabid was the hostility that some members of the
		  Legislature proposed to repudiate the contract. Even if some relief could be
		  ordered by a United States Court, a decision could not be obtained before the
		  land would be covered by ‘squatting occupants,’ who have a powerful
		  influence on frontier legislation. There is a fixed leveling demagogical spirit
		  prevailing, not only against a foreign literary institution, but even against
		  Tennessee colleges. The most influential champions of the University were
		  Haling in the House and Hall and Frey in the Senate. Some of our natural
		  allies, Carolina by birth, <hi rend="italics">yea even alumni</hi>of the good
		  <hi rend="italics">mater,</hi>tucked down their tails, as a Kentuckian would
		  say, or ‘took the water,’ as a Tennessean would say, before the
		  dreaded influence of popular breath.”</p>
          <p>Such was the popularity of their cause that the House of
		  Representatives refused to hear Balch and Brown, the University attorneys,
		  except by memorial. Balch afterward in asking for large compensation is
		  eloquent about his exertions. He had assisted in securing the compromise but
		  did not feel at liberty to state the mode of his exertions, though consistent
		  with justice and honorable deportment. When afterward the General Assembly
		  prohibited further locations, he applied for and obtained a mandamus from the
		  Circuit Court, for over three thousand acres, and on appeal argued the case in
		  the Supreme Court. In 1824 he endeavored to get relief from the General
		  Assembly, expending his time and money, though without success. This year he
		  went to Murfreesboro where the Assembly met, during the first week in the
		  session, remained there thirty-six days. His language hints at countless
		  beverages freely bestowed on thirsty legislators. He expended $50 to
		  $60 more than his tavern bills. It is certain that he “was not
		  pleading law,” for “what good would light and truth do with such
		  men?” Judge Murphey, who was his co-worker, “could tell how much
		  feeling is sacrificed and how much anxiety is suffered by those who are the
		  active agents in procuring any capital measure adopted by a Legislature of
		  Tennessee.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p399" n="399"/>
          <p>In addition to his work as a lawyer and lobbyist, he claimed that his
		  most valued services to the Board, though unobtrusive, were in thwarting the
		  schemes of speculators, and discouraging innumerable applicants by stoutly
		  maintaining the justice of the University claims and fighting off adverse
		  decisions of the courts. Especially he had induced the Chancellor to announce
		  that if the University had sold a warrant or the land without notice, the
		  <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi>purchaser was protected. This had quieted
		  fear on the part of purchasers. Even if the sale was with notice the purchaser
		  could only be made to pay the price of the warrant and the fees for locating,
		  not the value of the land.</p>
          <p>Balch thought that there were points of weakness in the claims of the
		  University which made it advisable for them to accept the compromise of 1825.
		  These were: first, the failure in the Act of Cession of 1789 to declare that
		  the reservation included equitable, as well as legal estates; and second, the
		  omission to state what ceremonies should be substituted for that of
		  “office found,” according to the ancient law books, in order to
		  consummate the escheat of the claim of the soldier. These points were
		  “anxiously considered and regarded with heavy doubts.” “Was
		  North Carolina able to pass any law concerning lands, or claims to lands in
		  Tennessee, after she ceded that territory to the United States, and especially
		  after it became a state in 1796?”</p>
          <p>Balch pressed for additional compensation. As yet he had received only
		  a land warrant. As we hear no more from him doubtless his soul was satisfied
		  with a cash payment.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>CREATION OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.</head>
          <p>On January 2, 1835, the Trustees determined to place the management of
		  the University in the hands of an Executive Committee of seven Trustees, of
		  whom the President of the Board (the Governor), should be <hi rend="italics">ex
		  officio,</hi>a member, the other six to be elected annually by the Board; the
		  Secretary of the Board to be Secretary of the Committee.</p>
          <p>Their powers were:</p>
          <p>1. All those of the Land Committee, of the Committee of Appointments,
		  and the Building Committee.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p400" n="400"/>
          <p>2. To sell the property and effects, real and personal, of the
		  University.</p>
          <p>3. To change and regulate the course of studies and discipline.</p>
          <p>4. To dismiss any Professor or Tutor for such cause as they may deem
		  sufficient.</p>
          <p>5. To fill vacancies in their own body.</p>
          <p>6. To keep a Journal and lay their proceedings before the next annual
		  meeting of the Board.</p>
          <p>This change, which has proved of signal benefit to the University, was
		  made at the instance of Mr. Cameron. It has given unity and efficiency to the
		  management of the institution. The Committeemen have been chosen with reference
		  to their residence in Raleigh, or easy access to it, and the understanding has
		  been, and on the reorganization in 1875 was expressly enacted, that they have,
		  in the recess of the Board, all powers not forbidden to them. In 1874 the
		  Executive Committee were authorized by Act of Assembly, and their number
		  afterward was increased to nine.</p>
          <p>The first chosen were Duncan Cameron, George E. Badger, William
		  McPheeters, Charles Manly, Frederick Nash and William A. Graham. Governor David
		  L. Swain was Chairman <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi>as well as a member.
		  At their first meeting on the 10th of January, 1835. Cameron was elected
		  Chairman, whenever the Governor should be absent.</p>
          <p>At a meeting held on the 5th of March, 1835, Governor Swain offered
		  resolutions, prepared by Duncan Cameron, appointing Charles Manly the agent of
		  the University to have a final settlement with the Tennessee agent, Samuel
		  Dickens, and empowering and directing him and Col. Dickens to sell all the
		  lands of the University in that State, at public or private sale, in bulk or in
		  parcels, as they might think best. The preamble given as the reason for this
		  heroic course, that the condition of the University is languishing and
		  precarious for the want of certain and available funds, and the resources of
		  the institution in Tennessee, on which it relies solely for existence, are
		  unavailable, complicated and far removed from the immediate supervision and
		  control of the Board of Trustees. Another reason <pb xml:id="p401" n="401"/>might
		  have been given that there was then a revival of speculation in Western
		  lands.</p>
          <p>Provided with a full power of attorney, which enabled him and Colonel
		  Dickens to do whatever the Board had power to do, Mr. Manly arrived at the home
		  of his colleague in Madison County, in West Tennessee, about the middle of
		  July. He made his final report on the 21st of November, 1835. After
		  consultation advertisement was made that all lands not sold privately would be
		  offered on the 17th of September in the town of Jackson, County of Madison, at
		  public auction on a credit of one, two and three years.</p>
          <p>The prospects of a satisfactory sale of all lands did not seem bright.
		  Colonel Dickens, since his last report, had disposed of many eligible tracts as
		  were sold, a few by Mr. Manly after the advertisement. Those that remained were
		  the remnants of what had been culled over for fifteen years. They were in the
		  counties adjoining Kentucky, unsuited to cotton and near Kentucky lands, which
		  could be had for twenty-five cents per acre. A large area owned by
		  non-residents depressed the price, while the millions of fertile acres in
		  Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas at almost nominal prices
		  had called off the attention of immigrants.</p>
          <p>On the other hand no one could predict when the tide would turn in
		  favor of Tennessee, and delay would involve loss of interest and payment of
		  taxes. It is true that some thought that the University lands were non-taxable
		  under the compact of 1822 whereby 60,000 acres were surrendered to Tennessee
		  Colleges, but it appeared that this compact had never been ratified by the
		  Legislature and the new constitution of Tennessee authorized no exemption. It
		  was concluded to go on with the auction sale, making vigorous efforts by
		  special notices to investors to procure bidders, privately or publicly. Such
		  notices were also given to men of wealth in the State who might take an
		  interest in the subject.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>FINAL SALE.</head>
          <p>The lands bequeathed to the University by Major Charles Gerrard had
		  all been sold, but the 20,000 acres donated by Governor Benjamin Smith still
		  remained. Of these 15,000 acres <pb xml:id="p402" n="402"/>were well night
		  unsalable, almost of no value. They had been shaken up by the great earthquake,
		  called by the settlers “the Shake,” and were largely covered by the
		  waters of the Obion river, which in places formed extensive lakes and swamps.
		  Other portions were rocky and unfit for cultivation. After much negotiation
		  42,345 83-100 acres at one dollar per acre, and the 20,000 Smith acres at
		  seventy cents an acre were sold to Messrs. Orme and Gifford, of Boston, for a
		  Northern company, and the $56,345.83 purchase money was paid by drafts
		  on New York and Philadelphia.</p>
          <p>This sale included all the University land except three tracts, which
		  were in litigation, and eight other parcels aggregating 5,020 acres, which
		  Secretary Manly expressed the desire to purchase for himself on such terms as
		  the Executive Committee should deem fair. He made collections of bonds for rent
		  of part of the Gerrard lands due before their sale, $543.48 and “a
		  tolerable good work horse and three mule colts.” “Finding the
		  animals rather inconvenient baggage for a stage coach, he converted them into
		  cash at the price of $204.”</p>
          <p>The Secretary highly praised the fidelity, energy and accuracy of his
		  associate, and gave a statement of his accounts from 1822 to the period of
		  their joint action. He had sold 59,319 acres for $160,147.05, and had
		  paid into the University Treasury $69,618.94, having disbursed on
		  warrants of the Land and Building Committee, fees to attorneys, taxes on lands
		  held under the Resolution warrants, his own compensation and other
		  contingencies, $23,613.96, showing uncollected $81,079.71 and
		  $10,309.13 interest; total uncollected $91,388.90.</p>
          <p>The Secretary and Treasurer then gives a condensed statement of the
		  financial condition of the University November 21, 1835:</p>

          <p>He estimates that at least $150,000 of this amount can
		  certainly be realized and invested, the interest on which, added to the tuition
		  receipts, will exceed the annual expenses of the present establishment by
		  $4,000.</p>
          <p>On motion of Governor Swain the Executive Committee gave the report
		  their entire concurrence, and as compensation for the services of Mr. Manly the
		  eight tracts of land, amounting to 5,020 acres, mentioned in the report, were
		  conveyed to him.</p>
          <p>In addition to the trials and discomforts of traveling by stagecoach
		  and on horseback, amid perils of robbers and perils of waters, and of
		  transacting business in a wild, sparsely settled country, the agent was
		  prostrated by a long spell of fever. To add to his embarassment, the wife of
		  Colonel Dickens, his associate, lay for many weeks at the point of death,
		  preventing her husband from leaving his home. Considering these things and the
		  long absence from home and from his business, the fee does not seem
		  excessive.</p>
          <p>In November, 1837, the Trustees concluded to dispose of all their
		  uncollected claims for land sold, and also their interest in one or two small
		  tracts, for which suits were then pending, to their agent Colonel Samuel
		  Dickens for forty-five thousand dollars, payable in equal installments in one,
		  two and three years, to bear no interest until the end of the first year.</p>
          <p>Naturally there was in those troublous days difficulty in transmitting
		  money. One draft for $13,000 by John Williams on J. M. McCulloch &amp;
		  Co., of Petersburg, Virginia, was protested, but finally settled by drafts on
		  Brander, McKinne and Wright, New Orleans, in five, seven, ten and fifteen
		  months. These were all protested for non-payment, and the Trustees compromised
		  the claim for $2,385 which was paid over to the Attorney of the Board in
		  Mobile. On his failure to account judgment was obtained against him, from which
		  nothing was ever realized.</p>
          <p>It is remarkable that the sudden acquisition of comparative wealth,
		  after a long struggle with extreme poverty, did not unsettle the ideas of
		  economy held by the Trustees. The application of Professors James Phillips and
		  William Hooper for free tuition for their sons was refused, although both were
		  clergymen. <pb xml:id="p404" n="404"/>The Board proceeded to enlarge the
		  institution with extreme caution.</p>
          <p>It must not be understood that an utterly safe deliverance of the
		  Tennessee lands was had. Orme and Gifford brought suit on account of the
		  defective titles of some of the tracts, which gave trouble for several years,
		  but the funds of the University were not greatly affected thereby. They also
		  brought a suit in equity to set aside the sale, but failed. A few parcels were
		  lost to those having superior titles and the Trustees made good their warranty.
		  The attorneys of the University were Samuel McClenehan and Thomas Washington.
		  As much as $1,700 in fees were paid the former and $800 to the
		  latter. The Trustees, who had charge of the University from 1868 to 1875 were
		  induced to prosecute a suit for the recovery of a tract, the title of which had
		  been passed to Orme and Gifford, or was long ago lost by the Statute of
		  Limitation. A bill of costs, including lawyer's fees, of over $400 was
		  the sad result.</p>

          <head>THE UNIVERSITY LIBRARY.</head>
          <p>It seems proper to give a history of the Library up to the death of
		  President Caldwell. I am aided by an eight-page pamphlet on the subject
		  published by Fisk P. Brewer (A. B. Yale), Professor of Greek in this
		  University, 1869-70.</p>
          <p>In the charter of the University the importance of a Library is
		  indicated by the direction that it shall be called by the name of its largest
		  donor. As no one appeared to claim the honor, after about fifty years, the
		  building was called after Governor Benjamin Smith, on account of his gift to
		  the infant institution. The first book given was a folio copy of Bishop
		  Wilson's works, one of a number presented to Congress by his son and by that
		  body distributed to the States. The resolution of Congress March 22, 1785, is
		  recited on the fly-leaf and then the following: “In pursuance of the
		  above resolution the undersigned, delegates from the State of North Carolina,
		  have agreed to transmit the works of Dr. Thomas Wilson to Newberne, to be
		  deposited there in the Library, belonging to the Public Academy, till the time
		  arrives, which they hope is not far distant, when the wisdom of the
		  Legislature, according to the express <pb xml:id="p405" n="405"/>intention of the
		  Constitution, shall have caused a College or University to be erected in the
		  State. HU. WILLIAMSON, JNO. SITGREAVES.</p>
          <p>The next donation was by the “Father of the University,”
		  Wm. Richardson Davie, thirty-nine volumes of such histories as those of Hume
		  and Gibbon. Richard Bennehan gave eight volumes and Joseph Blount Hill an
		  Encyclopedia of eighteen volumes.</p>
          <p>Next came Rev. James Hall, D.D., the Revolutionary captain of cavalry,
		  with forty-nine volumes. Joseph Gautier of Bladen County, a lawyer of ability
		  and a State Senator, bequeathed by will his library of about 100 volumes,
		  mostly in the French language. Besides public documents, nearly one hundred
		  others contributed by Judge John Williams, James Reid of Wilmington, David Ker,
		  first presiding professor; Abraham Hodge, the editor, of Halifax; the Centre
		  Benevolent Society of Iredell, through Rev. Samuel E. McCorckle, D.D.; Francis
		  N. W. Burton of Murfreesborough, Tenn.; Wm. Henry Hill, representative in
		  Congress, of Wilmington; Edward Jones, Wilmington and Chatham County, Solicitor
		  General; and General Calvin Jones of Wake and then of Tennessee. In 1812 it was
		  reported that there were in the Society libraries 800 to 1,000 volumes and in
		  the University library 1,500.</p>
          <p>In 1803 it was enacted by the Board that every student should be
		  considered as using the public library and should pay a tax for the privilege.
		  The fee was fifty cents per term or one dollar per annum. This was doubled in
		  1813. We have a record of 174 books bought with this fund in the three years
		  ending 1816. Afterward in 1824 there is a mention of forty-three volumes and
		  sixty-four numbers of journals purchased for $350.25. As there is no
		  further mention of receipts from the source it is probable that the tax was
		  abolished, the students using their funds for the building up of the Society
		  libraries.</p>
          <p>Among the regulations were the following: A borrowed book could be
		  kept out three weeks. Only juniors and seniors could take an Encyclopedia. The
		  Faculty fixed the price of <pb xml:id="p406" n="406"/>“hiring books,”
		  i. e., those text-books which were kept on hand for this purpose. Of course
		  injuries to books must be paid for.</p>
          <p>The Librarian's salary was one-half the fees. His duties were light.
		  The library was for some years in the President's house, in the room at the
		  head of the stairs; afterward in the University building.</p>
          <p>There were few works which undergraduates cared to read. The late
		  Judge Battle said that it was a matter of pride to borrow them, and then use
		  them as dead-falls for the swarming mice. The tall tomes of St. Augustine were
		  as efficacious in slaughtering these troublesome rodents as was their great
		  author in crushing the religious heresies of his day.</p>
          <p>In 1822 the Faculty reported to the Trustees that the chief need of
		  the institution was the procurement of books and apparatus. If five thousand or
		  even one thousand dollars should be at once expended for this it would be a
		  great relief of the distressing want. In 1824 President Caldwell went into the
		  subject at length and earnestly. He began by testifying to the usefulness of
		  the purchases made out of the library fees. He urged that it is perhaps hardly
		  considered that a Professor in a College, who is without books in a tolerable
		  supply, is analagous to the creation of nobility, which for want of estate is
		  obliged to live in rags. He compared the bookless professor to a lawyer without
		  copies of the statutes and reports of decisions. So a Professor of a College
		  should “employ his whole time and utmost diligence in the extension of
		  his knowledge by the examination and study of the multitude of authors who have
		  written upon the subjects upon which it is his business to teach and deliver
		  lectures.” He then gave illustrations of shoemakers without awls and
		  lasts, of carpenters without planes and chisels, and printers with one or two
		  fonts of worn-out type. “We have, however,” he said “been
		  greatly relieved by the resource furnished by the library money, with which we
		  have had it in our power to furnish some supplies of that species of food on
		  which, as instructors, we are called upon to subsist and grow.”</p>
          <p>Dr. Caldwell then asked for $6,000 for books and apparatus for
		  instruction, offering to go in person to Europe at his own
		  <pb xml:id="p407" n="407"/>expense to make the purchases. As had been stated the
		  offer was accepted, the money to be equally divided between additions to the
		  library and apparatus. The books, 979 in number, were placed in the library by
		  December, 1825. Donations were made by a bookseller in London of Thuanus in six
		  folio volumes and fifty-four volumes by the British and Foreign Bible
		  Societies.</p>
          <p>In 1827 the Board expressed its intention to appropriate $250
		  per annum for additions to the library, abolishing the $1 tax on
		  students, but owing to want of funds no purchases were made. Each professor
		  sent in a list of works needed in his department, but there was no response.
		  Dr. Mitchell recommended nine, including Gillie's History of the World. In
		  expectation of an up-to-date collection it was enacted that a student should
		  not take a book from the shelves. It must be delivered by the Librarian. Each
		  Tutor in turn was to be Librarian.</p>
          <p>The Record Commission of the English Government from 1833 to 1841
		  donated to the University eighty-three folios and twenty-four octavos, which
		  was accompanied by twelve books and many pamphlets written or edited by Charles
		  Parton Cooper, the Secretary of the Commission. Among the books presented by
		  the Commission is a copy of the Domesday Book, compiled by order of William,
		  the Conqueror.</p>
          <p>In 1836 Professor Mitchell journeyed to the North for the purpose of
		  examining a mineralogical collection. He reported that the greatest need of the
		  University was books, philosophical apparatus, cabinets of minerals, rocks and
		  shells, for which eight or ten thousand dollars should be expended. “We
		  have a professorship of modern languages,” he said, “and with the
		  exception of a broken copy of Voltaire's works and some old books of
		  controversy between the Catholics and Protestants, presented many years ago by
		  Gautier of Elizabeth, in Bladen, have hardly a French work—in Italian,
		  Spanish and <choice><sic>Portugese</sic><corr>Portuguese</corr></choice>we have nothing. Books are
		  continually published in the different departments of science and learning,
		  which the professors must have, without which the library of the University can
		  not be respectable.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p408" n="408"/>
          <p>Tutor W. H. Owen was the most active of the early librarians. In
		  December, 1836, he reports about 1,900 books in the library, kept in the
		  lecture room in the south building, the second story, south side, for years
		  called Governor Swain's recitation, or lecture, room. He states that the
		  munificence of individuals, conspicuous in the early history of the University,
		  had ceased, and there had been very little since the Caldwell purchases. When
		  the Trustees allowed the Faculty to choose from their number a receiver of dues
		  from students, the professors agreed to discharge the duty alternately, and to
		  give one-half of the compensation allowed them for the purchase of books. Since
		  the change of this plan and the appointment of Professor Mitchell as permanent
		  bursar this source of enlargement ceased.</p>
          <p>The report of the librarians show that there were no additions made by
		  purchase, the increase coming only from public documents of the United States
		  and this State, together with a few acts and reports of other States. Hon. B.
		  F. Moore, Chairman of a Select Committee, reported that not a volume has been
		  purchased by the Trustees during the last quarter of a century. The professors
		  have, in some instances supplied the means of instruction in their own
		  departments by most inconvenient draughts upon private resources. This latter
		  statement was especially true of Professors Mitchell, DeBerniere Hooper and
		  James and Charles Phillips.</p>
          <p>In 1850 a handsome new building, called by a belated act of justice,
		  Smith Hall, was erected for accommodation of the library. It is modeled after a
		  Greek temple. The hall is eighty-four feet long, twenty feet high and has five
		  ample windows on each side. An agreement was made with the students that the
		  annual ball might be herein, an arrangement which would have marred the
		  legitimate usefulness of the library if the books had been in demand. Professor
		  Hubbard, who was its chief officer for several years ending 1868, wrote that
		  “the College Library was never open to the students; on two occasions
		  only, as I remember, consulted by persons from abroad; and almost never, except
		  as told above (used by Governor Swain and the Librarian) used by members of the
		  Faculty.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p409" n="409"/>
          <p>After the death of Dr. Mitchell his books, 1897 in number, were
		  purchased for the Library. Many of them are still valuable, but the others,
		  owing to the rapid advance of the sciences, are mostly out of date. The
		  collection includes works on history, theology, the classics, general
		  literature and the sciences. Including these and a few donations, together with
		  constant additions of public documents, the library numbered about seven
		  thousand volumes. During the Civil War they were kept in a room in the Old East
		  building for safety, but were carried back to Smith Hall after the reopening in
		  1875.</p>
          <p>In 1885 the Trustees resolved that dancing should no longer be allowed
		  in Smith Hall, and two years afterward the University Library was consolidated
		  with those of the two societies. There are now about 40,000 volumes in the
		  total.</p>
          <p>Prior to 1838 the Librarian was appointed by the Faculty every half
		  year. After that date the Senior Tutor was <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi>
		  Librarian. This rule was broken in 1865 when Rev. Dr. F. M. Hubbard, Professor
		  of Latin, was chosen. We have the names of none of the early officers except
		  Tutor Joseph H. Saunders, in 1824. Tutor Wm. H. Owen held the office from 1836
		  to 1843. Then came Tutor Ashbel G. Brown for twelve years, succeeded by
		  Professor Hubbard, President Swain occasionally taking joint charge, until July
		  1868. Then came Prof. Fisk P. Brewer for one year, 1869-70. The officers since
		  the reopening in 1875 will be given in the second volume of this history.</p>
          <p>The Library contained some unique volumes, for example: The Elements
		  of Geometrie of the most ancient Philosopher Elucide of Megara, Faithfully (now
		  first) translated into the English toung by H. Billingsley, Citizen of London.
		  Whereunto are annexed certaine Scholies, Annotations and inuentions, of the
		  best Mathematiciens, both of time past and in this our age. With a very
		  fruitful praeface made by M. I. Dee, specifying the Chiefe Mathematical
		  Sciences, what they are and whereunto commodious; where, also, are disclosed
		  certaine new Secrets, Mathematical and Mechanical, until these our daies
		  greatly missed. The fly leaf at the beginning has the name of Montuela, a
		  distinguished French mathematician. The date of publication, 1570, is on the
		  last page.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p410" n="410"/>
          <p>Among the donations of Dr. Hall is an interesting book entitled
		  Derodon's Logic, 1659. On the fly leaf is “E. Libris Dan: Hyd: e Coll:
		  Wadh: Anno Domini 1696. This Professor Brewer says shows that it belonged to a
		  member of Wadham College in Oxford University. Another legend of a latter date
		  is “Ex libris Guli. Livingstone,” probably Wm. Livingstone,
		  Governor of New Jersey during the Revolution and afterward, and author of
		  works, civil and military.</p>
          <p>Another of Dr. Hall's gifts is a Latin paraphrase of Milton's Poems,
		  1690, by Gulielmus Hogaeus. It begins, “<foreign xml:lang="lat">Primaevi cano
		  furta Patris, furtumque secutae</foreign>.”</p>
          <p>President Swain said that the Library contained books donated by the
		  great Napoleon. He asserted, also, that for intrinsic value it was worth more
		  than the Society collections, an estimate in which few concur.</p>
          <p>The Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies from their beginning in 1795
		  accumulated libraries of their own. In the main the books were judiciously
		  purchased out of a fund provided by annual taxation of the members. Care was
		  taken to provide histories and other works useful in the preparation of
		  debates, as well as fiction, poetry, travels, and drama. As the libraries were
		  open only two or three hours a week, the opportunity for research was meagre,
		  but continuous access was given to the Commencement Debaters. A catalogue
		  printed in 1835 by the Dialectic Society shows the following aggregates:
		  Periodicals, 371 volumes; Epistolary, 77, Voyage and Travels, 106; Politics and
		  Law, 72; Poetical, 292; History, 356; Natural History, 37; Geographical, 27;
		  Dramatical, 106; Theological, 196; Biography and Memoirs, 248; Novels and
		  Romances, 493; Miscellaneous, 583. Total bound volumes, 2,954; and ten maps.
		  The Philanthropic Society library was equal to this, so as early as 1835 there
		  were about 6,000 well-selected books in the two, probably the best collection
		  in the State.</p>
          <p>The high-water mark of numbers during Caldwell's administration was
		  reached in 1823, when there were 173 matriculates. The 100 mark was crossed in
		  1817. From 1817 to 1827, both inclusive, the matriculates were 108, 120, 110,
		  127, <pb xml:id="p411" n="411"/>146, 165, 173, 157, 122, 112, 76. They continued
		  under a hundred for four years. From 1831 to 1836, inclusive, they were 107,
		  184, 109, 101, 104, 89. The highest number of graduates was thirty-four in
		  1824. It will be noticed that the falling off in numbers of the University was
		  prior to the panic of 1837. What were the causes? Doubtless there were more
		  than one. The panic of 1825 and the low prices of farm products must have kept
		  off students. <choice><sic>Morever</sic><corr>Moreover</corr></choice>, President Caldwell's
		  agonizing disease often deprived him of the power to attend to his duties.
		  This, of course, partly paralized the progressiveness of the institution. Then
		  again, the net receipts from the sale of the Tennessee lands became almost
		  nothing, and the payment of the interest on the $40,000 debt to the
		  banks left not a sufficiency to pay the salaries of the Faculty. This led to
		  resignations so that in 1829 there was one vacant professorship and two
		  tutorships, in 1830 one professorship, in 1831 and 1832 two professorships, in
		  1833 one. A fourth trouble was the Nullification controversy, principally in
		  South Carolina, but extending to the adjoining States, and at one time
		  threatening Civil War. Its effect on the University is shown clearly by the
		  following statistics. In 1820 there were seventeen; in 1821, nineteen; in 1822,
		  sixteen, students from South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Tennesee, and
		  Kentucky, while for the five years ending with 1833 there was from those States
		  only an average annual attendance of five. South Carolina in 1830 had no
		  students at all, and for three years, 1829-1832, inclusive, did not exceed
		  one.</p>

          <head>DR. CALDWELL'S DEATH.</head>
          <p>On the 27th of January, 1835, the sufferings of President Caldwell
		  were ended. His death brought grief to the officers and alumni of the
		  University, and to the friends of education and enlightened progress throughout
		  the land. He had stood by the cradle of the University, had worked for it
		  through its infancy up to strong manhood; had been the most potent factor in
		  placing it on the highest table-land of Southern institutions. He had lived to
		  see its pupils in all positions of usefulness and <pb xml:id="p412" n="412"/>honor
		  throughout our Southland, and he had their profound admiration. He had won the
		  position of educational headship in our State. He was the recognized authority
		  on matters connected with mathematical and astronomical questions.</p>
          <p>The early history of Dr. Caldwell has been already given.</p>
          <p>As a preacher, although not eloquent, he was an orthodox and fervid
		  expounder of Christian principles. Some of his sermons were sought for with a
		  view to publication, and a few, notably that on the death of Washington and at
		  the funeral of Prof. Samuel A. Holmes, were printed in pamphlet form by
		  admiring hearers. His style was elevated, too diffuse for modern taste, yet
		  highly appreciated by his contemporaries.</p>
          <p>Dr. Caldwell was on several occasions driven into print on account of
		  attacks on himself for alleged aristocratic views, and on the institution under
		  his charge. His adversaries found that he wielded with potency the weapons of
		  ridicule and of sarcasm.</p>
          <p>In his private relations he was neighborly, amiable and beloved. His
		  accomplished and able step-son, Rev. Dr. William Hooper, has shown how the
		  grave, almost stern, University President, at home disdained not the relaxation
		  of genial humor, radiated happiness around him, was affectionate and kindly to
		  all from his brilliant wife to the humblest slave.</p>
          <p>He wrote a series of letters to the public over the nom de plume of
		  Carlton, advocating, with much wealth of argument and information, gathered
		  during his visit to Europe, and by reading, the construction of railroads. This
		  gained for him the reputation of being one of the fathers of internal
		  improvements in our State. He advocated with similar intelligence and ability
		  common school education and thus took rank with Judge Murphey and Bartlett
		  Yancey as a pioneer in this great work. It has been mentioned that he was the
		  State astronomer in locating part of the Southern boundary of the State.</p>
          <p>It was in recognition of his services to the State and its
		  institutions that the General Assembly of 1841 conferred on a Piedmont county
		  the name of Caldwell, the only county which honors a teacher.</p>
          <p>Dr. Caldwell was a man brave and strong, of tireless energy,
		  <pb xml:id="p413" n="413"/>a scholar yet a man of action, stern in discipline, yet
		  of kindly heart, a true Christian, firm in his Presbyterian convictions, but
		  never intolerant towards others, a preacher fervent and forcible, a teacher
		  patient and inspiring.</p>
          <p>The following resolutions of the Trustees, whom he served, have the
		  merit of truth without exaggeration:</p>

                  <p>On motion of Governor Swain.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, the Executive Committee with the deepest emotions of sorrow have received intelligence of the death of Rev. Joseph Caldwell, D.D., President of the University.</p>
                  <p>Resolved, unanimously, that by the eminent purity of his life, his patriotism and zeal in the cause of learning, and his long, faithful and disinterested public service at the head of the University, Doctor Caldwell has approved himself one of the noblest benefactors of the State and deserves the lasting gratitude and reverence of his countrymen.</p>
                  <p>This eulogy was read in public at the next Commencement.</p>
                  <p>The students of the University passed the following resolutions, Haywood W. Guion being chairman and C. C. Battle secretary. Accompanied by a well-written letter they were forwarded to Mrs. Caldwell by Wm. P. Webb of Alabama, Wm. B. Rodman of North Carolina, and Robert W. Henry of Virginia:</p>
                  <p>Resolved, that the students of the University of North Carolina, deeply affected by the melancholy death of our much esteemed President, Joseph Caldwell, do convey to his bereaved family a proper expression of our profound sense of his acknowledged worth, and our unfeigned sorrow for his irreparable loss, which they and society have thereby sustained.</p>
                  <p>Resolved, that each of us do wear a suitable badge of mourning in testimony of our sorrow for his death and the cherished recollections associated with his name.</p>

          <p>He was first buried in the middle of the village cemetery, which was
		  originally designed for use of Faculty and Students of the University as well
		  as the inhabitants of Chapel Hill, in a grave dug and walled, in pursuance of
		  his orders. The body has been twice exhumed. In November after his death at the
		  instance of the Philanthropic Society, it was taken up under the direction of
		  Alfred S. Waugh, an artist, in order to get a plaster cast of his features. The
		  bust then executed is in Gerrard Hall and is a faithful reproduction. The grave
		  was again reopened on the 31st of October, 1846, and the remains were
		  reinterred by the side of his wife on the east side of the old monument.</p>
          <p>Judge Frederick Nash and Rev. Wm. McPheeters, D.D., were appointed by
		  the Trustees to erect an appropriate monument over his grave. In the first
		  impulse of enthusiasm a shaft worthy of the man and the University was
		  contemplated. We find that Mr. Robert Donaldson, of New York, sent designs, as
		  did the sculptor, Alfred S. Waugh. These were submitted by the Trustees to
		  David Paton, a Scotchman, one of the architects of the Capitol, but there is no
		  record of any report made by him. Eventually, in 1837, the design submitted by
		  Thomas Waite, an energetic, but careless, master mechanic, who then had charge
		  of carrying on the repairs of University buildings, was adopted.</p>
          <p>This monument was of sandstone from one of the quarries near the
		  University, either that on the plantation of Robert W. Strowd, or that of
		  Solomon Morgan, since bequeathed to the University by his daughter, Mrs. Mary
		  E. Mason. The shaft was cut by J. B. Turney, a skilled mechanic. It soon began
		  to <pb xml:id="p415" n="415"/>crumble and grow dingy. Moreover, the plan was to
		  insert on the eastern face a marble slab with appropriate inscriptions in
		  Latin, written by the scholarly teacher, Dr. Wm. McPheeters. When the slab came
		  from the workman at the North, the Latin was found to be, by careless
		  workmanship, so atrociously bad as to be beyond amendment. The professor of
		  that language in disgust seized a hammer and smashed the offending marble into
		  fragments. The unfortunate stone became offensive to good taste and all
		  interest in it was lost. No inscription was ever cut showing to whom the
		  structure was reared. When the New West building was erected its front was in
		  close proximity to the rugged and gruesome stone. The only recognition of it
		  was the raising of hats by the processions as they marched near it at
		  Commencements.</p>
          <p>The site chosen was, at the time, thought to be sufficiently remote
		  from any building then standing or likely to be erected. Its inconvenient
		  proximity to the New West building shows at once the progress of the
		  University, and the want of foresight in the able Committee. To their minds six
		  and seven score students were gratifying numbers and the locality selected was
		  hidden away from the active life of the University. The history of the new
		  monument will be told hereafter.</p>
          <p>At the request of the Executive Committee Prof. Walker Anderson, soon
		  to leave the institution for his eminent career at the bar in Florida, at the
		  ensuing Commencement, June, 1835, delivered an eloquent and appreciative
		  address on the career of the deceased President. He was peculiarly well fitted
		  for the task, having been his pupil, a professor in his Faculty, and his
		  assistant. He thus had a more intimate knowledge of the character of his
		  superior officer than was vouchsafed to others. The address was printed and
		  much enhanced the reputation of Judge Anderson as a graceful and eloquent
		  orator. It was his last work for the State and the institution which he had
		  served so long.</p>
          <p>I give some specimens of his style: “The religious character of
		  Dr. Caldwell was not the formation of a day, nor the hasty and imperfect work
		  of a dying bed. * * * He had made religion the guide of his youth; it
		  beautified and sanctified the <pb xml:id="p416" n="416"/>labors of his well-spent
		  life; nor did it fail him in the trying hour, which an all-wise, but
		  inscrutable Providence permitted to be to him peculiarly dark and fearful. The
		  rich consolations of his faith became brighter and stronger amidst the wreck of
		  the decaying of flesh; and, if the dying testimony of a pure and humble spirit
		  may be received, death had for him no sting—the grave achieved no
		  triumph. * * * His hope of a happy immortality beyond the grave was to him a
		  principle of strength that sustained him amidst the conflicts of the dark
		  valley; and to us, who witnessed the agonies of his parting hour, a bright
		  radiance illumined the gloom which memory throws around the trying scene. On
		  the evening of the 24th of January his terrible disease made its last ferocious
		  assault. * * * By the exercise of prayers and other acts of the holy religion
		  he professed, he strengthened himself for the last conflict, and spoke words of
		  consolation and hope to his sorrowing friends. But death was yet to be indulged
		  with a brief triumph, and for three days his sufferings were protracted with
		  such intensity that his vigorous and well-balanced mind sank beneath the
		  contest. We willingly drop the veil over the bitter recollections of that hour,
		  and we take refuge in those high and holy hopes which were the last objects of
		  his fading consciousness, and which had lent to the long twilight of his mortal
		  career some of the light of that heaven to which they had directed his longing
		  gaze.</p>
          <p>“The labors of a useful life, to use the thought of an old
		  stoick, are like things consecrated to God, over which mortality has no power.
		  <hi rend="italics">‘<foreign xml:lang="lat">Haec est temporis nostri sacra ac
		  dedicata; quam non inopia, non metus non morborum incursus
		  exagitat</foreign>.’</hi>The pure and patient spirit had escaped its
		  narrow and tempest-stricken prison house, the wasted form is resting from its
		  sore conflict in the blessed hope of a joyful resurrection, but those
		  consecrated acts of his useful life remain with us, to spread their beneficent

          <p>An honor appropriate to the career of the first President was resolved
		  on, the erection of a building near the east of the South building,
		  corresponding to Gerrard Hall, to be known as Caldwell Hall, and to be used as
		  a laboratory, library and lecture room. Waite, the Superintendent, was
		  instructed to take measures for its construction, but his management of the
		  finishing of Gerrard Hall and of the repairs of other buildings was so
		  extravagant and unbusinesslike that further action was suspended, as it proved,
		  indefinitely. For twenty years afterward the honor to Caldwell was talked of,
		  but never executed. The marble shaft of 1847 was thought to be sufficient.</p>

          <head>SUMMARY OF CALDWELL'S FACULTY.</head>
          <p>The changes in the Faculty during President Caldwell's second term,
		  not already mentioned, may be seen in the following summary:</p>
          <p>The President himself in 1816 changed from Mathematics to Moral
		  Philosophy. In 1834 he added Astronomy to his title. Elisha Mitchell was in
		  charge of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy (Physics), from 1817 to 1826, when
		  he took the chair of Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology and held it for the
		  remainder of his life.</p>
          <p>Denison Olmsted was in 1817 Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy. In
		  1825, in consequence doubtless of having been chosen Director of the State
		  Geological Survey, he added Geology to his title. He resigned the same
		  year.</p>
          <p>Ethan Allen Andrews was Professor of Languages from 1822 to 1826 when
		  his title was changed to Professor of <pb xml:id="p418" n="418"/>Ancient Languages,
		  which continued until his resignation in 1828.</p>
          <p>Walker Anderson, elected Adjunct Professor in order to aid President
		  Caldwell, was a native of Petersburg, Virginia, born July 11, 1801. His parents
		  were Daniel Anderson, a merchant, and Mary R. Cameron, a sister of Judge Duncan
		  Cameron, of North Carolina. Graduating with highest honor at this University in
		  1819 he studied law under his uncle, Judge Cameron. Having on his 21st birthday
		  married Phebe R. Hawks, sister of Rev. Dr. Francis L. Hawks, he was induced to
		  become the principal of a boarding school for females in Hillsboro. He was
		  called from this position to the University, at first as Professor of Rhetoric
		  and Logic, and then as Adjunct Professor of Natural Philosophy and
		  Astronomy.</p>
          <p>Resigning his chair in 1836 he emigrated at once to the Territory of
		  Florida and engaged in milling and mercantile business. Failing in these he
		  entered on the practice of law, and soon won eminence therein. Florida was
		  admitted into the Union as a state in 1846 and in 1851 the Legislature
		  organized her Supreme Court. Mr. Anderson was the first Chief Justice. He
		  resigned in 1853 and died in Pensacola January, 1857. He had fourteen children,
		  of whom three are living.</p>
          <p>Judge Anderson was a man of loftiest and purest character, of most
		  winning manners, of fine literary taste, and possessed of an easy, flowing
		  style. He was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church.</p>
          <p>William Hooper was Professor of Languages from 1817 to 1822, when he
		  resigned for his work as Episcopal minister. He returned in 1825 and was for
		  three years in charge of Rhetoric and Logic. In 1828 he succeeded Andrews in
		  Ancient Languages and held that place until 1837 when he left finally the
		  service of the University.</p>
          <p>Shepard K. Kollock was the first Professor of Rhetoric and Logic, in
		  1819, and resigned in 1825. This chair was vacant, except for a few months in
		  1828, but Professor Mitchell voluntarily added the duties to his own, during
		  much of the time.</p>
          <p>James Phillips succeeded Mitchell as Professor of Mathematics and
		  Natural Philosophy in 1826 and held that chair <pb xml:id="p419" n="419"/>until his
		  death. He was not elected without opposition. Mr. Ferdinand R. Hassler, an
		  eminent mathematical author, seemed to have been the favorite of President
		  Caldwell, but he probably declined to be a candidate. The claims of Matthias
		  Evans Manly, a tutor, destined to a most honorable career in the profession of
		  law, were pressed, the President admitted his ability, but while not opposing,
		  declined to recommend him, probably on account of his youth, he having
		  graduated only two years before.</p>
          <p>Nicholas Marcellus Hentz was elected Professor of Modern Languages in
		  1826 and held the place until his resignation in 1833. This chair was
		  established under a resolution offered by Mr. Badger, that a “Professor
		  of Modern Languages, including French, Spanish and as far as possible other
		  living languages of Europe be employed.” Treasurer Haywood, Judge Potter
		  and Rev. Dr. McPheeters voted <choice><sic>aganst</sic><corr>against</corr></choice>it, probably on
		  economical grounds. Although a majority of the Board were thus liberal at a
		  time when they were borrowing money wherewith to pay the Faculty, they approved
		  unanimously the report of a committee, of which Colonel Polk was Chairman, that
		  it was highly objectionable to pay one Raleigh newspaper $6.00,
		  $1.25, $3.50 and $4.50 for advertisements for which its
		  rival charged only $2.50, 75c, $1.87 1-2 and $2.50,
		  aggregating $15.25 for one and $7.62 1-2 for the other. These
		  sums were the total expenses for advertising for the year. As the newspapers
		  were of opposite politics it is easy to understand Colonel Polk's
		  criticism.</p>
          <p>Mr. Hentz seemed to have had little opposition though the President
		  very much distrusted the employment of foreigners. He urged in a general way on
		  the Board their probably inability to enforce discipline, arising from the
		  impossibility of their understanding the disposition of American youth. Weight
		  of character and personal influence are as much needed as learning. He
		  especially inclined to a Virginian applicant, who signed the pen name,
		  Inconnue, whose real name was Gessner W. Harrison, afterwards a noted educator
		  and author. It is probable, too, that the President distrusted the
		  <choice><sic>reliious</sic><corr>religious</corr></choice>principles of the foreign born.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p420" n="420"/>
          <p>Mr. Hentz was born in France July 25, 1797, and emigrated to America
		  in 1816. In 1825 he married Caroline Lee, daughter of General John Wright, of
		  Massachusetts. He taught Modern Languages at Northampton in that State, and at
		  Chapel Hill, Covington, Kentucky; Cincinnati; Tuscaloosa, Tuskegee, Alabama;
		  Columbus, Georgia; and Marianna, Florida. At some of these places he was
		  principal of schools. He was an agreeable and accomplished man and a good
		  teacher. He was distinguished as an entomologist, wrote a monograph on the
		  Arachnidae (spiders) which is of high authority. While at Chapel Hill he
		  occupied two small houses on the lot of Kemp P. Battle. On the walls of the
		  upper room of one of these, and in glass cases, were numerous insects impaled
		  on pins, some dead, others lingering, the modern humane method of asphyxiation
		  not being generally used. He is said to have imported for his dwelling the
		  first lightning rod in the village, in consequence of some strange freaks
		  played by the electric fluid during a storm. He died in Florida November 4,
		  1856.</p>
          <p>His wife, Caroline Lee Hentz, was born in Lancaster, Massachusetts, in
		  1800. She was beautiful, versatile and accomplished. She wrote a novel, a poem
		  and a play before she was thirteen years old. Like her husband she painted
		  elegantly in water colors. A tragedy by her, called “Lamona,” was
		  published. Her novels were much admired when published, but are now not read.
		  Among them are Lovell's Folly, Rana, The Planter's Northern Bride, Linda. In
		  Lovell's Folly she portrayed some inhabitants of Chapel Hill, among them
		  “Doctor November,” then the carriage driver of the President, and
		  Venus, his wife. Mrs. Hentz preceded her husband in death by a few months.</p>
          <p>While at the University this admirable couple met with a heart-rending
		  tragedy. A sprightly son of three or four years old, with his father's name,
		  fell from a chair and was instantly killed by the fracture of a bone in the
		  neck. He was buried in the garden of Dr. Mitchell's residence, now Professor
		  Gore's.</p>
          <p>Rev. Cornelius P. Vermuele was Professor of Ancient Languages for a
		  few months in 1830 during the absence of Professor Hooper on account of
		  sickness. The tutors were: <pb xml:id="p421" n="421"/>John Motley Morehead and
		  Priestly Hinton Mangum for 1817; Robert Rufus King and William Dunn Moseley for
		  1817-18; Hamilton Chamberlaine Jones and Simon Peter Jordan for 1818-19; S. P.
		  Jordan and R. R. <choice><sic>Kng</sic><corr>King[?]</corr></choice>for 1819-20; S. P. Jordan and
		  James Hervey Otey for 1820-21; Joseph H. Saunders and Anderson Mitchell for
		  1821-23; J. H. Saunders and George Shonnard Bettner for 1823-24; J. H.
		  Saunders, G. S. Bettner and Elisha Young for 1824-25; G. S. Bettner, Matthias
		  Evans Manly and Edward Dromgoole Sims for 1825-26; E. D. Sims, John Jenkins
		  Wyche and Oliver Wolcott Treadwell for 1826-27; Silas Milton Andrews, J. J.
		  Wyche and O. W. Treadwell for 1827-28; Lorenzo Lea and O. W. Thompson for
		  1828-29; Thompson Bird for 1829-30; Henry Grantham Smith and John Allen
		  Blackhouse for 1830-31; H. G. Smith, John DeBerniere Hooper and Jacob Thompson
		  for 1831-32; J. DeB. Hooper, J. Thompson and Giles Mebane for 1832-33; Jas.
		  Hogg Norwood, Thomas Lapsley Armstrong and Wm. Nelson Mebane for 1833-34.
		  Thomas Burgess Haywood held the position for awhile in this year. Samuel
		  Richardson Blake, William Pugh Bond and Harrison Wall Covington were the Tutors
		  for 1834-'35. In 1828 a Tutorship was offered to James D. Johnston, the able
		  teacher of Oxford, but was declined, although a salary of $800 was
		  annexed. David McAllister, Wm. Henry Owen, and Abraham Forrest Morehead taught
		  in 1835. In January, 1835, Owen tendered his resignation, and David Francis
		  Bacon of Connecticut was chosen in his place. On his declination, Owen was
		  induced to remain. A. Burgevin was two years Professor of Modern Languages.</p>

          <head>MITCHELL CHAIRMAN OF FACULTY.</head>
          <p>After the death of Caldwell to the arrival of President Swain, Dr.
		  Elisha Mitchell continued to be the Acting President. It has been stated that
		  Dr. Wm. Hooper desired the office. Of this there is no evidence, but the
		  tradition that he was in favor of the continuance of Dr. Mitchell, is probably
		  true.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>GRADUATES 1835.</head>
          <p>The highest honor man of the class of 1835 was Haywood William Guion,
		  who spoke the Salutatory. The next to him, declared equal, were Augustus J.
		  Foster and Wm. Peter Webb. <pb xml:id="p422" n="422"/>They drew lots for the
		  Valedictory, and Foster won it. Honorary orations were assigned to Samuel H.
		  Ruffin, James Hill Hutchins, Wm. Alexander Rose, Henry Lee Graves and James
		  Campbell Smith.</p>
          <p>Guion became a leader at the bar, an efficient President of the
		  Wilmington, Charlotte and Rutherfordton, now Carolina Central, Railroad
		  Company, and author of a scientific work, called the Comet; Foster was a farmer
		  and a most efficient Justice of the Peace, unable to engage in active pursuits
		  by reason of being a victim of rheumatism. Wm. P. Webb was a Judge in Alabama.
		  Of those not gaining honors, C. C. Battle was a lawyer, Private Secretary to
		  Governor Dudley, and a volunteer in the Mexican War. Richard B. Creecy is a
		  useful and honored editor and lawyer and author of many monographs illustrative
		  of the history of our State, now (1895) the oldest living graduate of this
		  University. One matriculate, Colonel Clarke M. Avery, was killed in battle.</p>
          <p>Of those not graduates, Johnston Blakeley Jones of Chapel Hill and
		  Charlotte, was a physician of skill and genius, and John Archibald Bingham was
		  a preacher and teacher in the noted Bingham School, his brother William J.
		  being Principal.</p>
          <p>The chief feature of the occasion was the eloquent eulogy, already
		  mentioned, on the character of the late President Caldwell by Professor Walker
		  Anderson.</p>
          <p>A meeting of the Institute of Education was held, but the proceedings
		  were not recorded, except that Professor Mitchell gave a talk on
		  Agriculture.</p>
          <p>Thomas S. Ashe, a recent graduate, afterwards Judge of the Supreme
		  Court of the State, was elected Tutor, but declined. It was stated that he was
		  in all respects an excellent student.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1835 under the management of Professor Mitchell,
		  Chairman, was the first after the death of Dr. Caldwell. The Trustees ratified
		  all the acts of the Executive Committee, including the resolutions about the
		  late venerated President. The students, with the happy buoyancy of youth, had
		  begun to make preparations for the usual ball, but the Faculty thought it would
		  be heartless and unbecoming. Both sides appealed to the Trustees, who sustained
		  the Faculty. 
		  <figure><graphic xml:id="ill11" url="bat1-422.jpg"/><p>D. L. Swain</p></figure><pb xml:id="p423" n="423"/>Messrs. Perrin Busbee and Green M.
		  Cuthbert managed the case for the students, doubtless with ability, for they
		  were men of superior talent. Their letter to Governor Swain, asking him to be
		  an honorary Ball Manager, “in order to give dignity and stability to the
		  occasion,” and his letter of refusal, were deemed of sufficient
		  importance to be spread on the Minutes of the Committee.</p>
          <p>The Committee, while deeming this contemplated violation of funeral
		  etiquette to be under their cognizance, administered a mild rebuke to the
		  Acting President Mitchell for summoning them to adjudicate some cases of
		  discipline. They refused to consider them, alleging that they belonged to the
		  jurisdiction of the Faculty.</p>
          <p>At the same time quite a sharp implied rebuke was administered to some
		  members of the Faculty by a resolution that, whenever one should be absent
		  without leave a pro rata deduction should be made from his salary. Possibly the
		  offender was Tutor Bacon, as he was shortly afterwards legislated out of
		  office, $150 being paid him for compensation for the remainder of his
		  year.</p>
          <p>This was a very notable meeting, because held on the 20th of June,
		  1835, when the important State Constitutional Convention of that year was
		  sitting in the Presbyterian Church at Raleigh. There were twenty-nine Trustees
		  present—very eminent men. They took steps to secure worthy candidates for
		  the office of President by recommending the Executive Committee to “open
		  correspondence with distinguished literary men, and in other ways,” the
		  election to be at the next annual meeting. The President's salary was fixed at
		  $2,000 per annum and the use of a dwelling.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>ELECTION OF SWAIN.</head>
          <p>On the 5th of December, 1835, David Lowrie Swain, on the nomination of
		  Duncan Cameron, was elected by ballot President of the University. It is not
		  stated that the vote was unanimous, but, as there was no other nominee, his
		  majority must have been large, as tradition so states. He was fond of
		  mentioning that, while he desired the place, he was unwilling
		  <pb xml:id="p424" n="424"/>to have it without the support of the strong men of the
		  Board. He therefore consulted Judge Frederick Nash and asked him to confer with
		  ex-Judge Duncan Cameron, and he would be guided by their opinion. The latter
		  was enthusiastic in his favor, the former acquiesced, and the Trustees
		  generally approved.</p>
          <p>He was elected on account of having been by his talents and winning
		  manners, a wise, energetic, successful administrator in the high public offices
		  to which he had been elected. Born on the 4th of January, 1801, he was well
		  taught by the skilled Rev. George Newton of Asheville, in the classics and
		  mathematics. He entered Sophomore Class of the University of North Carolina in
		  1822, but, on account of the bad health of his father and straitened means, in
		  a few months he left the institution for the study of law under Chief Justice
		  John Louis Taylor at Raleigh. He began practice in 1822 at Asheville, with
		  immediate success. He served in the House of Commons 1824 to 1829, when he was
		  chosen to be Solicitor of the Edenton Circuit, and was transferred the next
		  year to the Superior Court bench. The General Assembly, on the 1st of January,
		  1832, inaugurated him Governor. By successive elections he continued in that
		  high office for three years. After leaving the executive chair, he was an
		  active member of the Constitutional Convention of 1835. In all these positions
		  he studied with care and decided intelligently the questions which came before
		  him. In our State history he was peculiarly learned, and in that of the United
		  States, well versed.</p>
          <p>Although Professor Wm. Hooper sneeringly said, “the people of
		  North Carolina have given Governor Swain all the offices they have to bestow
		  and now have sent him to the University to be educated,” he was by no
		  means an illiterate man. Governor Perry of South Carolina in his book of
		  Reminiscences, states that he was the best scholar at the classical school of
		  Mr. Newton, and was proficient in Homer and other ancient authors. He was known
		  to quote lines from the Iliad after his coming to Chapel Hill. He had a
		  tenacious memory, was well acquainted with the genealogies of the leading
		  families of the State, and excelled as a popular speaker. His person was
		  <pb xml:id="p425" n="425"/>very imposing, over six feet high, but so ungainly that
		  numberless witticisms were perpetrated on its deviation from the standards of
		  manly beauty. An old Whig, boasting of the triumph of his party in a debate in
		  the Legislature, said: “The Democrats were beating us until old
		  ‘Warping Bars’ from beyond the mountains thrashed them out.”
		  But notwithstanding this defect, his genial temper, ready wit, his kindliness,
		  his gift of speech, made him a favorite in all companies, while his industry in
		  preparation on the questions under debate and skill in arranging his argument
		  made him a formidable antagonist. I add that in a long life his integrity was
		  never impeached, and that he was prudent in the management of his private
		  affairs. His great popularity in the State was a manifest gain to the
		  University.</p>
          <p>The new President was of a goodly lineage. His father, George Swain,
		  was of sturdy New England stock. Emigrating to Georgia, he was soon a member of
		  the State Legislature and of the Constitutional Convention. For the sake of his
		  health, he removed to a small farm near Asheville. Here he planted fruit trees,
		  some varieties imported from New England, raised the crops usual in his region,
		  and carried on the trade of a hatter. For years he was also Postmaster of
		  Asheville. Like New Englanders generally, he highly valued education, and gave
		  his children the best available opportunities.</p>
          <p>Governor Swain's mother was of a prominent North Carolina family, said
		  to have been connected with Governor Ralph Lane, who led a colony to Roanoke
		  Island. Her name was Caroline Lane, the widow of a good man, named Lowrie. She
		  was a sister of Colonel Joel Lane, long State Senator from Wake, who sold the
		  site of the seat of Government. Another brother was Jesse Lane, whose son,
		  Joseph, was a General in the Mexican War, a Senator from Oregon, and a
		  candidate for the Vice-Presidency on the Breckenridge ticket.</p>
          <p>It was intended by the Trustees that the new President should occupy
		  the dwelling on the west side of the Campus on Cameron Avenue, originally built
		  for its chief officer. But President Swain disliked to dispossess Professor
		  Mitchell of his home, and his wife did not approve the dwelling last occupied
		  <pb xml:id="p426" n="426"/>by Dr. Caldwell, because inconvenient for young
		  children. That next to the Episcopal Church on the east was preferred, and was
		  the executive mansion until 1848.</p>
          <p>There was much speculation as to whether the high standing and
		  personal popularity of President Swain would bring new students. In his favor
		  was the relief of the University from severe financial strain; against him was
		  the panic of 1837 and the depression of many following years. As late as 1845
		  cotton, the chief Southern money crop, brought only five cents a pound.
		  Remembering this, we conclude that his administration had a very successful
		  beginning. There were only 89 matriculates in 1835, entering in the fall before
		  his election. In 1837 there were 142; in 1838, 164; in 1839, 160; in 1840, 169;
		  1841, 167.</p>
          <p>The Faculty starting with President Swain were Elisha Mitchell,
		  Professor of Chemistry, Geology and Mineralogy; Wm. Hooper, of Ancient
		  Languages; James Phillips, of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy; Walker
		  Anderson, of Rhetoric and Logic; A. Burgevin, of Modern Languages. The Tutors
		  were Wm. H. Owen, of Ancient Languages, and David McAllister, of
		  Mathematics.</p>
          <p>Some friction arose between Dr. Mitchell and the new President because
		  of a criticism by the latter as to the deficiency of class work done by the
		  Department of Chemistry and Geology. The sensitive Doctor showed that by adding
		  his conducting of prayers and preaching of sermons, and his duties as bursar,
		  to his lecture work, he was not behind any other professor. The ruffled tempers
		  were soon appeased, and his relations with his chief were henceforth
		  harmonious.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>CLASS OF 1836.</head>
          <p>The village of Chapel Hill being of sparse population, and circuses,
		  theatres and such like entertainments being excluded, Commencements were
		  important occasions. The number of equipages and visitors was surprising. The
		  day was the first Thursday in June, selected so as not to conflict with the
		  courts of the neighboring counties. On Monday night of 1836 there were
		  declamations by members of the Freshman class, namely, <pb xml:id="p427" n="427"/>
		  Wm. R. Walker, Gaston H. Wilder, Wm. F. Brown, Dennis D. Ferebee, James H.
		  Headen, Duncan K. McRae, and Thomas D. Meares.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday night the declaimers were Augustus Benners, James Sidney
		  Smith, George Davis, J. W. Evans, John O. L. Goggin, J. J. Jackson, and James
		  Somerville of South Carolina.</p>
          <p>Of these, Brown, McRae, Smith, Benners and Goggin did not remain for
		  graduation. Smith was a lawyer and Assemblyman with reputation as a speaker.
		  Two of this year's matriculates, Lucius J. Johnson, Major, and Oliver H.
		  Prince, Captain, lost their lives in the Civil War.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday the orator chosen by the Philanthropic Society, Henry L.
		  Pinckney, a Representative in Congress from South Carolina, was to deliver an
		  address, but was unable to be present, on account of sickness. He forwarded a
		  copy of it to the Society, and at their request it was read by the President.
		  The newspaper correspondent reported that he “performed this duty to the
		  entire satisfaction of all and gave promise of making an able and popular
		  President.”</p>
          <p>In assigning the honors of Commencement day to the members of the
		  Senior class, it was resolved, 1st, that only two separate distinctions be
		  awarded to the two best scholars; the remainder to be divided into two orders,
		  to one of which honorary, called Popular, orations to be assigned, the other to
		  be required to prepare “Forensics.”</p>
          <p>To Wm. B. Rodman was assigned the Latin Salutatory, the highest honor.
		  To Lawrence W. Scott, the Valedictory in English. To James E. Crichton, Ralph
		  H. Graves, Wm. W. Hooper, Thomas Jones, Frederick N. McWilliams, and Charles L.
		  Pettigrew, “Popular Orations.”</p>
          <p>To the remainder were assigned what were called Forensics.</p>
          <p>Speeches at Commencement were by all the Seniors. The subjects are of
		  interest as showing what young men were thinking about in the closing years of
		  Andrew Jackson's administration.</p>
          <p>The Salutatory in Latin, Wm. B. Rodman. History, Ralph H. Graves. The
		  Influence of Fame on Genius, Fred N. McWilliams. The Influence of Catholicism

          <p>Although there was a recess for dinner, this formidable programme
		  illustrates the superior patience of our fathers and grandfathers.</p>
          <p>Of the honor men, Rodman was one of the ablest lawyers of the State,
		  and reached a seat on the Supreme Court bench. He was also a Colonel and member
		  of the Convention of 1868; Scott was a lawyer and also a physician; Crichton
		  was a physician, Graves a Tutor of Mathematics at the University and then
		  Principal of a classical school of very high standing and co-Principal of the
		  Horner School, father of the late very able Professor of the same name; Hooper
		  was a physician, who died early; Jones was a minister of the Gospel; Pettigrew,
		  brother of General J. J. Pettigrew, a successful planter and of wide influence.
		  Of those without honors, Henry Kollock Nash was a member of the Legislature,
		  Presidential Elector for Scott and Graham, and of high rank as a lawyer and
		  orator.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates with the class not graduating were Andrew Jackson
		  Donaldson, nephew and Private Secretary to President Jackson, Minister to
		  Prussia and Germany, and candidate for the Vice-Presidency with Fillmore; and
		  William H. Polk, brother of President Polk, Chargé d'Affaires at
		  Naples.</p>
          <p>Professor Mitchell and Rev. Dr. McPheeters were appointed a committee
		  to examine the curricula of the leading colleges of the United States and
		  report as to what advance should be <pb xml:id="p429" n="429"/>made in order to
		  assimilate the University of North Carolina to them. They found that there was
		  substantially little difference in the terms of admission, and no change was
		  then made.</p>
          <p>Among other events of this year, a Civil Engineer, W. D. Riddick, was
		  employed to investigate the sandstone formation east of the village to
		  ascertain if a quarry of building stone could be secured. Material for the
		  steps and window-sills was obtained at two places, as is shown by the sunken
		  pits, but has not proved to be durable. The first Caldwell monument is from
		  this rock. As only $13 was paid the engineer, the examination could not
		  have been extensive.</p>
          <p>Professor Mitchell, while on one of his annual visits to his old home,
		  was instructed to examine the cabinet of minerals belonging to Dr. J. H.
		  Griscom. The good doctor, evidently a Quaker, wrote from Philadelphia in
		  December, 1835, with an artlessness not expected of those living north of Mason
		  and Dixon's line, that his price was $1,500, but if he could not get
		  that he would take $1,250, and if a sale could not be effected by the
		  spring he would take even less. Professor Mitchell was not much impressed,
		  stating that he believed better results could be obtained by purchasing of M.
		  Moldenhauer of Heidelburg, Germany. He adds: “Baron Laderer, the Austrian
		  Consul, has one that he holds at $4,000. He has paid more for single
		  specimens than Dr. Caldwell did for the whole cabinet he purchased for the
		  Trustees.” As it is stated elsewhere that Caldwell paid only fifteen
		  dollars, the Baron must not have had very costly stones.</p>
          <p>While on this journey, Professor Mitchell went out of the way to
		  inspect Northern colleges, in order to inform the Trustees of our
		  deficiences—Yale, “the Methodist College in Middletown,” now
		  Wesleyan, Washington College at Hartford, Brown University at Amherst. He was
		  furnished with letters of introduction at Harvard and Princeton, but “was
		  so little gratified by what he had already seen that he neglected to use
		  them.” He advised that instruments purchased should be those useful for
		  illustration before a class, and gave a gentle criticism of Dr. Caldwell's
		  purchases in Europe, the Astronomical Clock, the Altitude and Azimuth
		  instrument, and the Transit, “all <pb xml:id="p430" n="430"/>good and
		  necessary in an Observatory,” but consumed a large part of the funds. Two
		  thousand dollars are needed for the department of Natural Philosophy.</p>
          <p>While the appropriations for Chemistry were once liberal, there was
		  then needed $1,000 additional to meet its wants, including Apparatus for
		  Electro-Magnetism and the Polarization of Light.</p>
          <p>He stated that the University had a Professorship of Modern Languages,
		  but the only books owned were a broken copy of Voltaire's works and some old
		  books illustrating the controversies between the Catholics and Protestants, the
		  gift of Senator Gautier of Bladen County. We had nothing in Italian, Spanish or
		  Portugese. Books are continually published in the different departments of
		  science and learning which the Professors must have and without which the
		  library can not be respectable. It is remarkable that the Professor in
		  enumerating the modern languages in which our deficiency was apparent, omitted
		  altogether German. He seemed to think we needed instruction only in Latin
		  tongues.</p>
          <p>For all these needs, $8,000 or $10,000 should be
		  expended. If a larger telescope should be desired, $1,200 or
		  $1,500 must be added. One at $1,200 had just been received at
		  Middletown from Leubours of Paris, and Princeton was expecting one more costly
		  from the shop of Fraunhofer.</p>
          <p>The Professor then takes up the question of cheap board for poor
		  students. The usual plan has been the establishment of Commons with dearer and
		  cheaper tables, of which the boarder can take his choice. This is liable to
		  great objections. We are brought into collision with the most capricious and
		  unmanageable part of the student's system—his stomach. All of them lead
		  an inactive life, and therefore have not the ravening appetite they have at
		  home after a day's work or hunting. The Steward's Hall is a common source of
		  vexation and disturbance at all colleges. It is suggested that students
		  earnestly desirous of an education, “willing to live on very plain food
		  and make out their dinner on Greek roots and Conic sections,” shall have
		  a house where they can manage for themselves. The Professor hopes, with the
		  approval of the Trustees, <pb xml:id="p431" n="431"/>with the funds accruing from
		  the tuition money, to provide such an establishment.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mitchell was, when this letter was written, temporary President,
		  and his recommendations were made as such. It does not appear that he carried
		  into effect his plan of helping poor students to cheap board, but in recent
		  years it has been adopted with great success. The Steward's Hall was rented to
		  persons willing to charge reasonable rates to students, but the latter were not
		  compelled to patronize its tables. Among those who entered into the obligations
		  were John B. Tenny, Mrs. McCauley, widow of Wm. McCauley, Mrs. Caroline Scott,
		  widow of John Scott, who removed from Hillsboro to Texas and died soon
		  afterwards, and Miss Sally Mallett. In 1847 the wings were given to President
		  Swain to be used in erecting a servants' house, and the main structure was
		  sold.</p>
          <p>The building designed for public exercises, Gerrard Hall, was finished
		  in 1837. As most of the exercises during the year were of a sacred character,
		  it was known as the New Chapel. Person Hall, or the Old Chapel, was soon given
		  up to lectures, divided into four rooms for this purpose. The chief carpenter
		  and manager was Thomas Waitt, a man of force but careless in his financial
		  dealings; extravagant, but not chargeable with dishonesty. He was succeeded by
		  Kendal Waitt, probably his son, who was for many years the carpenter, locksmith
		  and plumber for the institution. They were from New England.</p>
          <p>In this year the vacations were enlarged to six weeks in summer and
		  the same in winter.</p>
          <p>An entry in the Treasurer's book of 1836 brings to mind that the
		  astutest of men could be caught by the fallacious hopes of what are now called
		  “boom towns.” Peter Brown was a hardheaded, closefisted lawyer, a
		  native of Scotland, who accumulated a fortune of $200,000. A town was
		  laid out at the junction of the Cape Fear and Haw Rivers, which it was expected
		  to be connected with the ocean by slackwater navigation and to become a
		  prosperous commercial city. It was named after the State Treasurer, John
		  Haywood, and aspired to be the capital of the State and the site of the
		  University. <pb xml:id="p432" n="432"/>Many leading citizens hoped to share in the
		  golden harvest by buying lots, among them the sagacious Peter Brown. When he
		  turned his real estate into money in order that his Scottish nephew might
		  obtain the fund under his will, his Haywood investment escaped his memory, and
		  the University, by escheat, obtained $25, not for each front foot, but
		  for the whole acre.</p>
          <p>One —— Seabrook was appointed Tutor of Modern Languages at
		  $600 per year. The Faculty books show that he did not accept the offer,
		  but for several months, February to May, 1836, A. Burgevin was numbered among
		  the Professors, his chair being that of Modern Languages. Of him we know
		  nothing.</p>
          <p>After paying off pressing debts, the Trustees bought from the State
		  100 of the five per cent certificates of $1,000, each bearing five per
		  cent interest, issued under an Act passed in 1835, “to provide for paying
		  for the Shares reserved to the State in the Capital Stock of the Bank of the
		  State of North Carolina.” In 1837 the certificates were surrendered in
		  exchange for one thousand shares of stock in the bank. As the bank paid an
		  average of eight per cent dividends, the $8,000 annually thence derived,
		  together with the tuition money, occasional escheats and interest on money
		  loaned, constituted the income of the University until the ruin of the Civil
		  War.</p>

          <head>GRADUATES OF 1837.</head>
          <p>The Commencement of 1837 was held in Gerrard Hall. The newspaper of
		  the day, the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register,</hi>describes it as a
		  “commodious building, with large galleries, just completed with becoming
		  taste and good style.” The reporter became enthusiastic and poetical in
		  depicting the occasion. “It is the first young budding of fame to a
		  Collegian, to see an ocean of bonnets and ribbons, and the banks of snow gauze
		  waving and rustling at his appearance, as if the gentle south had breathed on a
		  wheat field; but it is the full bloom of popularity, if, when he retires, he
		  shall see the ocean toss with emotion that rolls beneath its
		  surface.”</p>
          <p>On Monday night came the Freshmen declaimers, generally called
		  Competitors, Tod R. Caldwell, John W. Cameron, Wm. <pb xml:id="p433" n="433"/>H.
		  Henderson, John A. Lillington, Duncan Sellers, Albert Shipp and Wm. M. Shipp.
		  The Sophomore Competitors were George Davis, Joseph W. Evans, James
		  Summerville, Wm. R. Walker, Dennis D. Ferebee, James H. Headen, Walter A.
		  Huske. All graduated in regular course.</p>
          <p>The address before the Literary Societies was by Hon. Robert Strange,
		  a Senator of the United States, who had been a Judge of the Superior Courts. He
		  was a polished speaker, a graduate of Hampden-Sidney College, especially
		  successful as a criminal lawyer, when appearing for the defence.</p>
          <p>The Representatives chosen by the Dialectic Society were Benjamin M.
		  Hobson, Joseph John Jackson, Thomas D. Meares, and by the Philanthropic, James
		  M. Burke, Hazell W. Burgwyn, and William S. Pettigrew. William J. Long was
		  added by the Faculty.</p>
          <p>In those days there was no prize to the winner and no adjudication by
		  a committee or by the audience, as to the merits of the speakers, but the best
		  always learned from his friends the good news of his triumph. All these became
		  graduates except Burke, who died three years afterwards.</p>
          <p>The honors in the Senior class were awarded, the highest to Wm.
		  Waightstill Avery, who spoke the Valedictory, and the next to James G. Womack,
		  with the Latin Salutatory. Honorary orations were next assigned to the
		  following, whose rank was in the order of their names. Augustus Benners, on The
		  Importance of Southern Literature. Perrin H. Busbee, on The Causes which have
		  retarded Political Economy. Peter W. Hairston, Future Prospects of our Country.
		  Leonard H. Taylor, Character of the Aborigines of America.</p>
          <p>Forensic orations, that is, those carrying no honor, were assigned to
		  Alexander Swann, Samuel B. Massey, George Holley, and Kemp P. Alston.
		  Afterwards Massey, Alston and Holley were excused, and Swann being displeased
		  with the report, refused to stand the examinations and speak.</p>
          <p>The first-honor man, Avery, attained a distinguished position at the
		  bar and was a leader in the Democratic party. He was Speaker of the State
		  Senate and a Senator of the Confederate <pb xml:id="p434" n="434"/>States. He was
		  killed in 1864 while repelling a raid of bushwhackers on Morganton. Womack was
		  a physician in Tennessee. Benners, the next scholar, was a lawyer and member of
		  the Legislature in Alabama. Busbee was an able lawyer, of large practice and
		  Reporter of the Supreme Court. He was cut off in middle life; Hairston was a
		  wealthy planter of much influence; Taylor was a physician of great repute in
		  Granville.</p>
          <p>Some non-graduates of this class were Wm. Barringer of Cabarrus, a
		  Methodist minister, accidentally killed while superintending the building of
		  the Greensboro Female College; Joseph Branch, Attorney-General of Florida;
		  Richard S. Sims, a physician in Virginia. Two matriculates were killed in
		  battle, General Isom Garrett of Alabama and Thomas Ruffin, Colonel, of
		  Goldsboro.</p>
          <p>On the 19th of June of this year there appeared in the
		  <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Register,</hi>a bad-tempered attack on the
		  University under the guise of a reply to a circular of the Executive Committee.
		  It was asserted that the Legislature had expended on the institution nearly
		  half a million dollars; that it was cruel to dismiss a student for contracting
		  a debt; that the terms of admission were far below those of Columbia, Yale,
		  Harvard and other institutions; that no certificate of character was required
		  for entrance; that the situation of Chapel Hill was bad, except for health;
		  that visitors had extreme difficulty in being accommodated; that the Faculty
		  are under a moral compulsion to throw open their doors and virtually keep
		  houses of entertainment without charge; that clergymen were excluded from the
		  Board of Trustees, that a majority of the Faculty belonged to one denomination;
		  that religion was not provided for—the South Carolina College in a
		  measure failed because its head was an infidel; that the University of Virginia
		  had Religion engrafted into it by its friends; that there should be a Christian
		  chair; that lampooning the Faculty at Commencement should be stopped; that
		  merriment should not be excited by such expressions as “Old
		  Charley,” “Mike,” etc., designed to ridicule some
		  peculiarities of Professors; that ladies were the subject of vulgar sarcasm;
		  that there was want of commanding elevation <pb xml:id="p435" n="435"/>of
		  character; that good schools were needed in different parts of the State; that
		  the Chair of Ancient Languages should be divided; that there should be a
		  separate chair of Civil Engineering; that there were five institutions under
		  control of only three denominations; that if the University should not be
		  improved it would be of little value; that there were only 101 students out of
		  750,000 inhabitants, and only 66 were citizens of the State, whereas
		  Massachusetts had three colleges and 600 students; that of 500 or 600 preachers
		  in the State, only about 20 had collegiate training.</p>
          <p>These criticisms are either petty or untrue. President Swain did not
		  reply.</p>
          <p>In 1837 the ordinance in regard to intoxicating liquors was
		  strengthened by making it a dismissable offence to bring them into the college
		  buildings. The same penalty on one publicly intoxicated was enacted. A
		  committee of the Trustees, of which Wm. Gaston was chairman, reported in favor
		  of making the resolution of the Faculty on this subject a by-law of the
		  institution. Since that time drunkenness, private as well as public, and indeed
		  drinking spirituous liquors of any kind, have been made grave offences. The use
		  of wine was not prohibited under this resolution, but was left to be dealt with
		  under the general laws of the institution, punishment following drinking to
		  excess.</p>
          <p>It is evidence of the conscientious regard for duty to the public
		  shown by the Trustees of this day, that in the petty matter of detail of
		  covering the South Building with tin, it did not occur to them to charge the
		  President solely with its execution. One of the Executive Committee, General
		  Samuel F. Patterson, was associated with President Swain in having the work
		  done.</p>
          <p>A resolution was passed for building two new dormitories, but the
		  project was abandoned. The Societies pressed this or some other structure,
		  urging the necessity for greater accommodation for their libraries and debating
		  halls. An argument was made that rooms should be provided for
		  “frank” students, often called beneficiaries. As the by-law stood,
		  these could not live in the college buildings, unless there were vacant rooms
		  after pay students were accommodated.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p436" n="436"/>
          <p>In pursuit of the ignis fatuus of prohibiting merchant's credit to
		  students, the President was directed to prosecute offenders and to dismiss the
		  students accepting it. The law proved a dead letter. Merchants continued to
		  break it and parents seldom failed to redeem the pledges of their sons. No
		  criminal prosecution was ever instituted.</p>
          <p>All the officials of the University retained their faith in bylaws,
		  regulating the conduct of “the establishment,” to use a favorite
		  term of old days. All of them from the beginning were referred to President
		  Swain and Dr. Mitchell, who were to rewrite them and submit them to a revising
		  <choice><sic>comimttee</sic><corr>committee</corr></choice>, Professor Phillips, Green and Hooper.
		  They had little influence for good. An able student afterwards, Colonel David
		  M. Carter, deliberately attempted by experiment to ascertain how nearly he
		  could come to breaking the law without crossing the line. When summoned before
		  the Faculty, he appeared, bylaws in hand, and ingeniously argued that he had
		  not transgressed them. They have been proved to be useless and have not been
		  reprinted since the re-opening in 1875. So important did the Faculty regard
		  these rules that Governor Morehead and Secretary Manly were requested to
		  explain them to the students in the Chapel, which request was probably complied
		  with.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>REV. DR. WM. HOOPER.</head>
          <p>As Prof. William Hooper left the University finally in 1837, a sketch
		  of him is here given. He was born in Hillsboro, August 31, 1792, the son of
		  William Hooper, a merchant, whose father of the same name was a signer of the
		  Declaration of Independence. His mother was Helen, daughter of James Hogg, one
		  of the commissioners who selected the site of the University. His father died
		  when he was a boy, and his mother, as has been said, became the second wife of
		  President Caldwell. He entered the University of North Carolina, obtained his
		  degree of A.B. in 1809 and A.M. in 1812; was Tutor in the University 1810-1817,
		  and Professor of Ancient Languages 1817-22. He studied at Princeton Theological
		  Seminary 1812-13. His mother was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church,
		  and naturally he followed her footsteps for <pb xml:id="p437" n="437"/>a time. He
		  was made a Deacon in 1819, and ordained Priest in 1822. He resigned his
		  professorship and was Rector of St. John's Church, Fayetteville, 1822-24. In
		  1825 he rejoined the University, as Professor of Rhetoric and Logic, 1825-28,
		  and then held his old chair of Ancient Languages until 1837.</p>
          <p>In 1831 he became dissatisfied with the doctrines of the Episcopal
		  Church on the subject of regeneration and infant baptism, and joined the
		  Baptist denomination. In 1838-40 he was Theological Professor in Furman
		  Institute in South Carolina; Professor of Roman Literature in the South
		  Carolina College, 1840-46, and President <hi rend="italics">pro tempore;</hi>
		  President of Wake Forest College, 1846-49; teacher of a classical school for
		  boys near Littleton, 1849-51; Pastor of the Baptist Church at Newbern, 1852-54;
		  President of the Chowan Female Collegiate Institute, Murfreesboro, 1855-61;
		  teacher in the Female Seminary, Fayetteville, 1861-65, and associate principal,
		  with his son-in-law, Professor John DeBerniere Hooper, of Wilson Collegiate
		  Seminary for Young Ladies, 1866-75, when he removed with his son-in-law to
		  Chapel Hill. He received the honorary degree of Master of Arts (A.M.) from the
		  College of New Jersey, now Princeton University, in 1888; that of Doctor of
		  Divinity from the University of North Carolina in 1857, and that of Doctor of
		  Laws (LL.D.) elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Dr. Hooper married in December, 1814, Fanny P., daughter of Colonel
		  Edward Jones, Solicitor-General of North Carolina. They had seven children;
		  William, a physician; Edward, also a physician; Mary, who married Professor J.
		  DeBerniere Hooper, her second cousin; Joseph Caldwell, a teacher; Elizabeth;
		  Thomas Clark, a lawyer and teacher; and Duponceau, who was mortally wounded at
		  Fredericksburg. The descendants of Dr. Hooper are the only descendants of Wm.
		  Hooper, the signer, his other children having left no issue.</p>
          <p>Dr. Hooper was distinguished for accurate and varied scholarship and
		  literary power. He wrote no book, but many of his sermons and addresses were
		  printed and were widely appreciated for the soundness of their teachings, and
		  their delightfully interesting style. I have given extracts from
		  one—“Fifty Years Since”—delivered at the Commencement
		  of 1859. His <pb xml:id="p438" n="438"/>addresses were usually of a religious or
		  educational character, but occasionally he deviated from this rule. Once he
		  made a severe attack on the code of morals of the legal profession, and was
		  answered with the keenest satire by Judge Edwin G. Reade in what were called
		  the Pickle Rod Papers.</p>
          <p>Though often brimming over with delightful humor, he was sometimes
		  subject to melancholy. Some thought that his accidentally killing in his
		  boyhood a young girl relative left a permanent impression on his mind. It is
		  more likely that impairment of his health, which more than once caused him to
		  change his residence and his pursuits, was the cause of his occasional
		  gloominess of spirit. This did not prevent his being a genial companion, or
		  interfere with his laborious reading, enlightened teaching, or heart-searching
		  sermons.</p>
          <p>On July 4, 1876, Dr. Hooper, by invitation, attended the celebration
		  at Philadelphia of the Declaration of Independence. He died on the 19th of the
		  next month and, at his request, was buried by the side of his mother at the
		  base of the Caldwell monument.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1838, Charles Manly delivered the address
		  before the Alumni; an earnest plea for pride in the University. The annual
		  address was by Wm. B. Shepard, an accomplished lawyer and member of Congress,
		  who ably proved the value of the classics as a liberal education. His accepting
		  this trust shows that he had forgiven his dismissal for injecting politics into
		  his Senior speech of 1816.</p>
          <p>In preparing for this Commencement, the Faculty disclaimed all right
		  to control the expression in the speeches of political opinion, not in
		  violation of good taste. This resolution was, after some years, repealed,
		  because such expressions were offensive to part of the audience.</p>
          <p>The Freshmen Declaimers were C. C. Graham, V. A. McBee, Wm. J. Clarke,
		  F. M. Pearson, J. J. Norcott, A. O. Harrison, T. H. Scott, and Samuel Hall.</p>
          <p>Those from the Sophomore class were J. H. Headen, W. H. McLeod, W. A.
		  Huske, J. A. Lillington, F. H. Hawks, A. H. Caldwell, Thomas D. Meares, and Wm.
		  Thompson. All of the Declaimers became graduates except Norcott and Hall. The
		  <pb xml:id="p439" n="439"/>latter became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of
		  Georgia; and Caldwell, prominent at the bar and of weight in the Legislature.
		  Meares a very forcible speaker in the Convention of 1861 and in the
		  Legislature.</p>
          <p>The Society representatives were Wm. Marcellus McPheeters, who spoke
		  on the Disadvantage of Early Entrance into Political Life.</p>
          <p>Isaac N. Tillett on the Pernicious Influence of Great Talents without
		  Moral Integrity.</p>
          <p>John W. Cameron, on Party Spirit.</p>
          <p>Jarvis Buxton, on National Pride.</p>
          <p>John N. Barksdale and Dennis D. Ferebee debated the great question
		  whether there should be Liberal or Strict Construction of the Constitution.</p>
          <p>Barksdale, Cameron and McPheeters were of the Dialectic Society, the
		  others of the Philanthropic.</p>
          <p>In awarding the distinctions in the Senior class of 19 members, Green
		  M. Cuthbert and George R. Davis were pronounced first and equal. The second
		  rank was assigned to Joseph Washington Evans, James Summerville, Albert
		  Gallatin Hubbard, and William Richmond Walker; the third to Joseph John
		  Jackson.</p>
          <p>A special distinction was given Benjamin Mosely Hobson for proficiency
		  in Composition. On drawing lots, Davis drew what was recently made the prize,
		  the Valedictory, leaving the Latin Salutatory to Cuthbert. The others had
		  original speeches in English on various subjects. The Commencement was
		  pronounced to be brilliant. The addresses were said to show “manliness of
		  thought, a propriety of diction in the composition, indicating much strength of
		  mind and high intellectual culture.”</p>
          <p>We have the rest of the scheme of the exercises. After prayer and
		  Cuthbert's Latin Salutatory, J. W. Evans spoke on the Importance of Exclusive
		  Application to Collegiate Studies; James Summerville on the Influence of Steam
		  Navigation on our Relations with Europe; W. R. Walker on the Adaptation of the
		  United States to the Advancement of Literature; H. W. Burgwin, on the
		  Pernicious Influence of Unprincipled <pb xml:id="p440" n="440"/>Politicians; N. W.
		  Herring on the causes of the Present Prosperous Condition of our Country; and
		  Colin Shaw and Wilson W. Whitaker debated whether the Oregon Territory should
		  be colonized by the United States.</p>
          <p>Then was the adjournment for dinner. On reassembling, A. G. Hubbard
		  spoke on the Causes which have retarded American Literature; J. J. Jackson on
		  the Influence of the American Congress on the Eloquence of the Country; K. H.
		  Lewis on the Nature and Tendency of Executive Power; Wm. J. Long, on the
		  Propriety of Educating Southern Youth at Southern Institutions; Benj. M.
		  Hobson, on the Mutual Relations and Interests of Virginia and North Carolina;
		  Gaston H. Wilder on the Spirit of the American Government. The Valedictory by
		  George Davis followed, then the Report on the public Examination, then the
		  Degrees were conferred, and lastly the Benediction.</p>
          <p>Of the first-honor men, one was especially distinguished in after
		  life, George Davis. The middle letter of his name, R., inserted from boyish
		  fancy, was dropped after he left the University, this action possibly hastened
		  by his fellow-students insisting that it stood for Rascal. He became eminent
		  for eloquence, legal ability, and loftiness of character, reaching the dignity
		  of Attorney-General of the Confederate States, and refusing a seat on the State
		  Supreme Court bench. Cuthbert, his rival, was a lawyer in Newbern, of good
		  style as a writer, much sought after as the orator on anniversary occasions, of
		  fine promise as an adviser in law, but cut off in early manhood by pulmonary
		  consumption. Many of his kin were excited by his example to seek higher
		  education and in teaching and other vocations exerted broad influences for
		  good.</p>
          <p>Of those who attained second and third honors, Hubbird (or Hubbard)
		  and Jackson were prominent lawyers and Representatives in the Legislature.</p>
          <p>Of those receiving no honors, John J. Roberts became an Episcopal
		  minister, Professor of French in this University, after qualifying himself in
		  France, and Principal of High Schools for Females in New York and
		  Massachusetts; McCauley, a grandson of one of the donors of the University
		  site, was <pb xml:id="p441" n="441"/>a Captain in the Confederate army and Senator
		  from Union. Wilder was Senator from Wake and Receiver of confiscated property
		  under the Confederacy.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, Joseph B. Cherry was a member of the
		  Legislature. Four matriculates, Gen. L. O'B. Branch, Sergeant Thomas H. Lane,
		  Colonel Gaston Meares and Private George M. Ruffin, were killed in the Civil
		  War.</p>
          <p>The critical correspondent of the year before, “C,”
		  continued his fault-finding, though in a lesser degree. There were instances of
		  lampooning the Faculty, he wrote, and of lugging in politics, which the
		  President promised to correct. Bad taste was shown in lauding distinguished men
		  in their presence—better wait until they are dead. The Faculty afterwards
		  prohibited political speeches and all allusions to any officer of the
		  institution.</p>

          <head>DR. MITCHELL'S REPORTS.</head>
          <p>Professor Mitchell, who had been appointed Bursar the preceding year,
		  made semi-annual reports of his actings as Bursar. I doubt if any financial
		  officer ever mixed as much humor with his dry figures. I give a specimen. On
		  November 29th, writing to Secretary-Treasurer Manly, then Clerk of the Senate,
		  he says: “I do suppose the business connected with this same Bursarship
		  is of as complicated and vexatious character as is done in North Carolina.
		  There have been paid in this session something more than 1,200 dollars. This I
		  have to pay out, and not a little of it in tens, fives, fours, and thus and so
		  on down to a few cents, and to keep all these matters regular between Trustees,
		  Faculty, Parents, Students, Merchants, Boarding-house Keepers, Washerwomen and
		  niggers, and be able to prove that all is correct at any time, requires that a
		  man be wide awake. A student changes his boarding-house or his washerwoman, and
		  neither party dreams that it can be of any importance to note the time. So I
		  have to investigate the whole matter and make all straight as best I can. I
		  should do better if I had to do with men—knowing what the rules and
		  proprieties of business are, but the Petticoat has the ascendancy at the Hill.
		  My principal customers are women, some 15 in <pb xml:id="p442" n="442"/>
		  number—married women, widow and maid—to say nothing of those that
		  are neither—and such a time as I have!</p>
          <p>“Hoping that you may get plenty of wisdom and enlightenment or
		  of folly and fun during your attendance on the Magnates of the Land (General
		  Assembly), I remain, “Yours, E. MITCHELL.”</p>
          <p>Again, he describes the condition of his dwelling. “The fences
		  are in ruins, the piazza in front could hardly be supported by all the props
		  that could be collected. The rain pours through the roof. We are obliged to
		  exercise no little skill in the sleeping apartments to keep dry. The repairs
		  were commenced in 1833, and have been going on slowly ever since.” The
		  records show that this dismal condition was at once rectified.</p>
          <p>The Doctor's letters and accounts are in an excellent legible hand,
		  with almost no corrections. They show that he charged himself with the tuition
		  dues of every student, so that non-collections, unless excused by the Faculty,
		  on the ground of poverty, were deducted from his commissions.</p>
          <p>I give another specimen of the Doctor's humorous reports. In November,
		  1841, he states that he journeyed to Hillsboro to receive the funds forwarded
		  for the payment of the salaries of the Faculty, and “a jolly set of
		  fellows they are. They have folded up their lanthorn jaws and look sleek and
		  greasy like so many monks. With this excellent salve applied to their feelings,
		  they will improve wonderfully and give the boys a mild and gentle
		  examination.”</p>
          <p>He had sent on to John Randolph Clay, our Chargé d'Affaires in
		  Vienna, $1,200, and had received the invoice for the cabinet of minerals
		  purchased by him for the University and had effected insurance from Trieste to
		  Petersburg. The Captain stopped at the Ionian Isles for a load of currants,
		  which, he interjects, “are not currants but grapes,” and so
		  vitiated the policy. As the University had twice lost goods and their price by
		  want of insurance, he had ordered a new insurance or ratification of the old.
		  He goes on to state that M. Partosch, the Curator of the Emperor's Cabinet,
		  certifies that the collection is <pb xml:id="p443" n="443"/>worth more than 3,000
		  florins (48 1-2 cents each, or $1,455). “The letter of Mr. Clay
		  has taken a load of at least a ton and a half from my mind.”</p>
          <p>He informs Mr. Manly, who, by the by, was not averse to the pleasures
		  of the sideboard, that there are three bottles of Tokay in one of the boxes, so
		  when he comes up he shall be permitted to look at it through the sides of the
		  bottle and smile at it through the cork—the utmost that can be allowed to
		  one supposed to share in the late Temperance movements in Raleigh.</p>
          <p>In thinking of this famous wine he was reminded of the antiquated
		  maiden, who, rehearsing the attractions of her youth, mentioned the lover
		  who</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Stole her slipper, filled it with Tokay,</l>
            <l>And drank the little bumper every day.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>When the Doctor could not recall the writer of these lines, it is not
		  perhaps remarkable that his daughters promptly reminded him.</p>
          <p>The Doctor then shows the difficulties he has in regard to collections
		  of tuition money. Although he charged himself with every student, it was
		  impossible to collect from all at once, as they must wait until funds are sent
		  by parents. Why not let him render his account at the end of the term and show
		  what he has collected and in what instance failed. Those being reported as
		  deficient would be stirred to promptness. Students would doubtless acquiesce.
		  The ancient Greeks and Romans when they captured a city first ravished the
		  women and married them afterwards. This acquiescence was doubtless due to the
		  fact that the practice was well understood in international law, as to which he
		  refers to Dr. Swain, in charge of that department, who discusses the matter at
		  large with zeal, interest and feeling. It appears that the Trustees did not
		  change the mode of keeping accounts, but after his death allowances were made
		  sufficient to cover all losses. No instance is known of any student being
		  excluded for not settling his bills.</p>
          <p>The collection of minerals, an exceedingly fine one, arrived in due
		  time, and forms what is known as the Vienna Cabinet of Minerals.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p444" n="444"/>
          <p>Besides collecting and paying out money, Professor Mitchell, whose
		  soul thirsted for all work, as well as all knowledge, had charge of the grounds
		  and repairs of the buildings. As cattle were allowed to run at large, it became
		  necessary to surround the part of the campus on which are the buildings with a
		  permanent fence. The Professor introduced from his native State, Connecticut,
		  the durable walls of stone. Beginning in the year 1838, he exploited every
		  stony hill on University land and hauled their granite treasures over
		  improvised roads. Traces of these roads and broken rocks prized out of their
		  beds, but found too heavy for the wagons, remain to this day. Whenever the
		  University mules became jaded, the Professor substituted his own, and when the
		  great task was finished in 1844, the Trustees paid him liberally. Part of the
		  campus, reaching to the Raleigh road, was designed to cover fifty acres, but
		  Professor Charles Phillips some years afterwards calculated the area to fall
		  half an acre short. The campus, a much larger area, included land, to the east
		  and south of the walls.</p>
          <p>The system of rock walls, as they are called, was extended to most of
		  the Professors' residences and was adopted by many citizens of the village.</p>
          <p>On December 4th of the same year President Swain reported disturbances
		  Saturday and Sunday nights and that two or three students had been dismissed in
		  consequence. A more serious offense was the burning of the old, unoccupied
		  Observatory building heretofore described. The pecuniary loss was small. The
		  President wrote: “This ill-starred building has from the period of its
		  creation been a nuisance rather than a benefit to the institution. The
		  instruments were removed and the house abandoned two years since and on
		  examination, more than a year ago, the walls being found partly dilapidated and
		  the wood work wrotten (rotten), the Faculty advised that it was not considered
		  worth repairing.”</p>
          <p>This worthlessness, however, the President contended furnished no
		  excuse to the incendiaries and he asked the instructions of the Executive
		  Committee as to whether the criminal law of the State should be resorted to in
		  order to discover the offenders. He stated that the laws and usages of the
		  University <pb xml:id="p445" n="445"/>afford clear evidence that the institution of
		  a criminal prosecution has not been regarded within the discretion of the
		  Faculty. It is remarkable that it is impossible to discover from the letter
		  whether the sagacious President advises that witnesses shall go before the
		  Grand Jury, or have the terrifying threat, like a dark and lightning laden
		  cloud, to deter from similar offences in the future. Such displays of caution
		  are not uncommon in the President's history. They are in truth part of his
		  policy. He could be abundantly firm when occasion justified.</p>
          <p>There is on record the following letter of Captain Jesse D. Elliott,
		  of the U. S. Ship Constitution, a native of Maryland, who served with
		  distinction in the battle of Lake Erie and in other engagements in the War of
		  1812. He succeeded Commodore Perry in command of the Erie fleet:</p>

          <p>On December 11th, 1838, the students of the University, through a

          <pb xml:id="p446" n="446"/>
          <p>2nd. Students who reside at a distance must remain at Chapel Hill or

          <p>3rd. The wearied would have time to become rested and the debilitated

          <p>4th. The Committee believed that no regulation, which may conduce to

        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE ABORTIVE DELPHIAN SOCIETY.</head>
          <p>The unsuccessful attempt to establish the Delphian Society deserves
		  special notice.</p>
          <p>The seceders were mainly from the Dialectic, only one member from the
		  Philanthropic Society joining them. The memorial address by them to the Board
		  of Trustees, asking for recognition and the counter memorial state the grounds
		  of the movement.</p>
          <p>The Committee, in strong language, portrayed the bitter sectional
		  feeling between eastern and western students. The members of the Dialectic
		  Society are mainly from the West, those of the other from the East. The moment
		  a new student arrives at the Hill he is seized by the members of one of the
		  two, receives every attention, has every wish gratified, taken to the
		  libraries, introduced to other members, is flattered and cajoled. If this isn't
		  sufficient to secure him, every little inconsistency or rash act of the other
		  society is pressed upon him. He then, during his University course, not only
		  imbibes feelings of aversion to those in his own society not living in his
		  section, but dislike to those of the other society, which are not dissipated
		  because from the arrangement of the dormitories they can not be dissipated or
		  softened by mutual intercourse. These positions are elaborated at length, the
		  argument being directed against compulsory joining either society. Protest is
		  especially made against the right to eject the Delphians from
		  <pb xml:id="p447" n="447"/>the College building on the grounds that the Trustees
		  have assigned the rooms to the members of the old societies. The Committee ask
		  a fair division of rooms, it being gently hinted that otherwise the Delphians
		  will not be present at the next session to make any claims.</p>
          <p>The ties which once bound the Delphians to the other societies, it was
		  alleged, are dissolved <hi rend="italics">now and forever.</hi>They have
		  formed a body for mutual improvement in oratory and science, for advantages
		  impossible to be secured in bodies containing as many members as the Dialectic
		  and Philanthropic Societies. It is believed that “the Trustees will
		  <hi rend="italics">hardly condescend</hi>to throw aside the <hi rend="italics">dignity</hi>of their office for the purpose of taking sides in
		  <hi rend="italics">puerile associations</hi>for literary improvement. There
		  are but few, if any, of the members of the old societies, who do not find the
		  duties arduous and fatiguing. From the increase of numbers these duties have
		  become a burden rather than a pleasure. For advantageous improvement fifty are
		  sufficient for any literary body.”</p>
          <p>The Delphians seek recognition by the Trustees. They believe they will
		  eventually equal in usefulness to the University the other two societies. The
		  ill-feeling heretofore existing being divided among three bodies will be less
		  harsh and permanent. They ask for one-third of the rooms, agreeing to have the
		  same responsibility for damages as had been promised by the Dialectic and
		  Philanthropic Societies, with the understanding that rooms not occupied by
		  Delphians may be used by members of the other societies, they becoming
		  responsible for damages.</p>
          <p>The memorial is dated November 29th, 1838, and is signed by Thomas D.
		  Meares of Wilmington, a fair student; John A. Maultsby of Columbus, one of the
		  best in his class; and Wm. H. Dudley of Wilmington, not fond of his books, a
		  son of Governor E. B. Dudley. All were influential.</p>
          <p>A committee of the Dialectic Society, all strong men, W. H. Henderson
		  of Kentucky, Isham W. Garrott of Wake County, and John Worthy Cameron of
		  Richmond County, wrote to Secretary Manly, stating that “for private
		  reasons several individuals had lately withdrawn and wholly separated
		  themselves <pb xml:id="p448" n="448"/>from the body, that by the 9th chapter of the
		  last revised code of laws the rooms of College therein appropriated
		  respectively to the two Societies belong exclusively to themselves.” The
		  Society desires to know whether this will be adhered to, and if not, whether
		  its guaranty against dilapidation does not cease.</p>
          <p>The Society acted with singular moderation and good temper. Reciting
		  in a preamble that false reports were in circulation that unfairness and
		  injustice had been done the seceders, knowing that in differences of this
		  nature a spirit of conciliation must first come from the majority, it was
		  “Resolved, that if it meets with the wish of the dissenters, our
		  differences be laid before a committee consisting of the following gentlemen:
		  Governor Dudley, Governor Swain, Judge Cameron, Judge Ruffin, Charles Manly,
		  Esq., and the Rev. Wm. McPheeters, for their examination and adjustment, and we
		  agree to abide by their decision.”</p>
          <p>A committee, namely J. N. Barksdale, J. W. Cameron and I. W. Garrott,
		  notified the Executive Committee of this action. They stated “that the
		  only ostensible reason for the withdrawing is the existence of certain laws,
		  which have been adopted in our constitution and executed for many years,
		  requiring a regular attendance at prayers and recitations, and others
		  regulating the moral deportment of our members, which were coeval with the very
		  foundation of the Society. If any other causes exist they were not made known
		  at the time of the withdrawal.” They add that the Society authorize them
		  to promise that if any one wishes to return, neither his withdrawal nor his
		  obstinacy in rejecting the measures of reconciliation, shall be an obstacle to
		  his readmission.</p>
          <p>It appears that after this communication, a letter was received from
		  Secretary Manly, kind in tone, but suggesting that some of the laws were too
		  stringent, if not tyrannical. This was laid before the Society and an answer
		  adopted, which was reported by a new committee, Wm. F. Brown, I. W. Garrott and
		  W. H. Henderson.</p>
          <p>It is asserted that the laws requiring attention to University duties
		  and regulating morals have met, so far as was known, with the approval of the
		  older members, and especially of Secretary <pb xml:id="p449" n="449"/>Manly, as was
		  expressed in his address at the preceding Commencement. Efforts have been
		  yearly made to repeal these laws by obtaining the votes of the new members, but
		  in vain.</p>
          <p>Some of the present Freshmen who voted for repeal are now advocates of
		  the laws. “If the Society's retaining in its code laws, which tend to
		  make its members regular in their attendance on prayers and recitations, and to
		  suppress drunkenness and vice, be considered tyrannical and oppressive, then
		  the members of the Dialectic Society confess themselves guilty of this charge,
		  but that the majority ever exercised any tyranny or oppression over the
		  minority, the committee do most positively deny.” Only about one-half of
		  the minority seceded, the others are staunch members of the Society. Does not
		  this show that the charge is imaginary. It is obvious that it is to the
		  interest of the Society that the seceders should return, and the committee
		  pledge themselves that the return of all, or any, “will be hailed with
		  joy.” Efforts have already been made to this end. The proposition of the
		  Society to refer all the questions at issue to arbitrators was returned without
		  answer by the Delphians, because it was addressed to “The
		  Dissenters,” instead of the Delphian Society. Another objection was that
		  one member had seceded from the Philanthropic Society and could not be called a
		  dissenter from the Dialectic. A request that the ex-Dialectics should consider
		  the proposal separately was refused.</p>
          <p>The committee profess the highest regard for Secretary Manly and
		  request him to lay their letter before the Trustees. “Let the whole
		  matter be probed to the bottom, and the escutcheon of the Dialectic Society
		  will be found as bright and untarnished as when our predecessors had it in
		  their keeping.”</p>
          <p>In December, 1838, the letters from the Dialectic Society and “a
		  committee of students styling themselves the Delphian Society,” were
		  referred by the Board of Trustees to a committee consisting of Messrs. Badger,
		  John H. Bryan, and Secretary Manly. In January, 1839, the committee, through
		  Mr. Bryan, reported that it was inexpedient to establish a third literary
		  society. The Board concurred in the report and referred the
		  <pb xml:id="p450" n="450"/>matter to the Executive Committee. On the 10th of the
		  same month these met and were so much impressed with the gravity of the
		  situation that they requested Governor Dudley and Messrs. R. M. Saunders, John
		  H. Bryan, and Charles Manly, a quorum of the committee, to hold a meeting at
		  Chapel Hill “to consider, hear and determine these disputes.” This
		  was done. The Delphians were reasonable, and after an eloquent appeal by
		  Secretary Manly, the society was dissolved.</p>
          <p>There is an old saying in substance that the real controlling motive
		  for human action is not that which is publicly given. This is probably true as
		  to the reasons given for the attempted formation of the Delphian Society. About
		  four years ago an eminent physician of St. Louis, Missouri, Dr. Wm. Marcellus
		  McPheeters, son of Rev. Dr. Wm. McPheeters, revisited his alma mater, which he
		  left about fifty years before. On his authority, and that of Hon. S. F.
		  Phillips, I give the chief causes of the secession movement. Thomas Davis
		  Meares of Wilmington was a dominant force in the Dialectic Society. He had a
		  ready, forcible and often eloquent style of speaking. He was a prime favorite
		  of his set, mostly city-bred and leaders in balls and social entertainments.
		  While he was of an open, manly nature and manners, and personally entirely free
		  from snobbishness, many of the members thought that his associates formed
		  themselves into a species of caste, claiming social superiority. McPheeters,
		  the son of a Presbyterian minister, the principal of a school for boys of wide
		  reputation, the Raleigh Academy, came to the University city-bred and well
		  taught. Owing to his father's scruples about dancing and similar amusements, he
		  naturally did not become a follower of Meares and was persuaded to be his
		  competitor for the office of Representative at Commencement. Much to his
		  surprise he was elected. The ardent friends of his opponent attributed the
		  result to hostility to him as an eastern man, the sectional feeling on the
		  subject of inequality of Representation in the General Assembly not having died
		  out. They concluded that if so popular a man as Meares is beaten they were
		  bound to be in a hopeless minority.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p451" n="451"/>
          <p>I remember being in the lobby of the State House of Representatives
		  twenty years after this society trouble and being struck with the impassioned
		  earnestness with which the same Thomas D. Meares, then a Representative from
		  Brunswick, accused other sections of being hostile to the lower Cape Fear
		  country and especially Wilmington, because they opposed aid to a railroad
		  projected for its benefit. There could be no doubt of the sincerity of his
		  convictions. He felt strongly and spoke strongly and the aid was granted. The
		  eastern and western feelings which culminated in the Convention of 1835 caused
		  the schism in the Dialectic Society in 1838. In this, as at other times, the
		  University was a little world, containing in miniature the aspirations and
		  passions of the larger community of which it formed a part.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>SEPARATE CHAIRS OF GREEK AND LATIN.</head>
          <p>In August, 1838, the Professorship of Ancient Languages was abolished
		  and separate chairs of Greek and Latin were established. The professorship of
		  Modern Languages was changed into the more modest chair of the French Language.
		  Manuel Fetter of New York was chosen to the chair of Greek and John DeBerniere
		  Hooper to that of Latin. Charles Marey was appointed to teach the French
		  Language, to hear seven recitations per week, in addition to giving
		  instructions in Topographical drawing. His salary was $750 per annum. At
		  the same time the Faculty were required to introduce Civil Engineering, upon
		  such plan as they deemed advisable and expedient. This was not carried into
		  effect, the Executive Committee reserving the right to abolish the foregoing
		  improvements if the receipts from tuition money should fall below $7,000
		  per annum.</p>
          <p>Manuel Fetter was of German descent, born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania,
		  in 1809. Noticing his bright parts Rev. Wm. Augustus Muhlenberg, the eminent
		  divine and author, took charge of his education and trained him to an unusual
		  knowledge of the classics, Hebrew, French, and German. It was expected that he
		  would enter the ministry, but after attending school at Flushing, Long Island,
		  and Andover, he embraced the profession of teaching. The testimonials submitted
		  <pb xml:id="p452" n="452"/>to the Board of Trustees were exceptionally strong and
		  he was unanimously elected. He brought with him his young bride, a lady of
		  great vivacity and kindness of heart and fitted to adorn the social life of
		  Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>For reasons probably personal Professor Marey, who was a Frenchman
		  born, was accorded only the rank of Instructor. He was a man of good
		  accomplishments and handsome physique, but his usefulness was ruined by his
		  fondness for ardent spirits. After serving a year the President heard an
		  uproarious row going on in his recitation room. Hurrying thereto he found the
		  Instructor too drunk to teach, mercilessly guyed by his class. The President
		  sternly said, “Mr. Marey (pronounced Mar-ee), I will take charge of this
		  class. You are relieved, sir.” With lofty and drunken gravity, Marey
		  replied, “If you give this order as President of the University, I obey.
		  But if you give it as David L. Swain I demand satisfaction!” On being
		  assured that the action was official, he vacated, speedily left the Hill and
		  soon the news came that he had been killed in a brawl in Charleston, South
		  Carolina.</p>

		  caused thereby, there were no further entries of cases of discipline decided by
		  the Faculty until January, 1836. After this there was for awhile a marked
		  diminution of disorder. There was a fight in which a dirk was drawn and another
		  in which a pistol was used only to intimidate the victim from resisting a
		  beating with a stick. There was the running off to Pittsboro of three students
		  under the strong suspicion of intoxication. We read of an egg-nogg frolic in a
		  room in college, for all of which appropriate punishments were meted out,
		  suspensions and pledges for the drinkers, while the man with the pistol was
		  dismissed. With these exceptions all was very quiet until 1838. On the first
		  Saturday night of the session of that year an organization, styling itself
		  “The Ugly Club,” with horns and tin pans and lusty lungs and
		  whatever ingenuity can devise to make a noise, including of course the College
		  bell, <pb xml:id="p453" n="453"/>was organized to banish sleep from old and young.
		  Nineteen of them were caught and made to sign the appropriate pledge.</p>
          <p>To illustrate the patience of the Faculty this case is given. J. B.
		  continued to talk audibly in Professor Hooper's recitation room, although
		  pointedly admonished to refrain. He was then requested to leave the room which
		  he refused to do. The Faculty gave him three opportunities to admit his error,
		  kindly reasoning with him on the subject and explaining to him that obstinacy
		  would certainly incur the penalty of dismission. As he continued obstinate a
		  resolution to suspend him was adopted. Here Professor Hooper interceded and the
		  Faculty rescinded the resolution. This could not have happened in the days of
		  Caldwell.</p>
          <p>In the summer of 1838 the proceedings of The Ugly Club were described
		  as particularly disreputable. The members were disguised with lamp black, gave
		  gross insults to sundry citizens of the village, threatened violence to members
		  of the Faculty and “committed trespasses of peculiarly low and disgusting
		  character on private property.”</p>
          <p>W. G. was the leader. He promised amendment, but did not keep his
		  promise. He rode a horse through the west building, was repeatedly reproved for
		  disorders in the recitation rooms and irreverence at prayers. He was suspected
		  of various other disorders of an aggravated character and was frequently absent
		  from recitation. He was dismissed, but on the usual pledge and at the request
		  of his class he was retained. In a few months, however, he was dismissed again.
		  It is noticeable that dismissed students were now readmitted without promising
		  to obey the laws in the future.</p>
          <p>A novel case presented itself in this year. At the Senior speaking in
		  November one of the most orderly was found to be intoxicated on the stage. His
		  excuse was that he drank wine in order to declaim with animation and that,
		  being unaccustomed to stimulants, he took too much by mistake. The recently
		  passed law about drunkenness compelled the Faculty to suspend him for two
		  months.</p>
          <p>At a later date a Senior who had nerved himself with “Dutch
		  courage,” remarked to a colleague sitting near him, in a seriocomical
		  <pb xml:id="p454" n="454"/>whisper, “if my time doesn't come on shortly, I'm
		  afraid my liquor will die out.”</p>
          <p>A number of the Seniors, during the Senior vacation were delinquent in
		  attending prayers. They were called up and informed that further unpunctuality
		  in this regard would forfeit their diplomas.</p>
          <p>The Ugly Club of 1840 seems to have been comparatively mild mannered,
		  as only five participants were haled before the Faculty and duly lectured.</p>
          <p>The behavior in the Chapel, during divine services, was such as might
		  have been expected from compulsory attendance, especially when in the winter
		  there was no fire. We find constant complaints of disorderly conduct. The three
		  clerical members of the Faculty, Mitchell, Phillips and Green, were appointed a
		  special committee to report on the best means of enforcing order on such
		  occasions. Their recommendations are not on record, except that two of the
		  college servants were ordered to attend during divine service. Their potent aid
		  must have been needed to remove the obstacles to decent worship prepared by
		  busy and impious hands the night before. These obstructions were sometimes
		  piles of lumber, sometimes tar on the benches, sometimes a patient bull
		  yearling fastened in the nave, vulgarly called “bull-pen.” One
		  recommendation of the committee in regard to order in the Recitation room was
		  adopted, that spitting on the floor should be a misdemeanor. The recommendation
		  that the students should sit in the alphabetical order of their names was laid
		  on the table, but afterwards adopted.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>FRUITLESS MOVEMENT FOR A CHAPLAIN.</head>
          <p>In 1836 the Societies petitioned the Trustees for the appointment of a
		  regular Chaplain according to the plan of the University of Virginia. They
		  offered to contribute $200 per annum toward the salary, provided that
		  the Faculty and students would pay $400. The Trustees agreed to this,
		  promising to pay the latter sum out of the University Treasury, a Methodist,
		  Episcopalian, Baptist and Presbyterian to be employed in rotation. President
		  Swain in 1837 applied to the Methodist Bishop, Rt. Rev. Dr. Thos. A. Morris,
		  for the assignment of Rev. E. Wadsworth, <pb xml:id="p455" n="455"/>a very
		  competent man, husband of a sister of Mrs. Swain. Bishop Morris gave a
		  peremptory refusal, stating as his reason that Chapel Hill was small and, apart
		  from the University, presented insufficient prospect of successful labor to
		  justify making it a regular station to be supplied annually; and to supply it
		  for the sake of the University, once in four years, would not probably justify
		  the deduction of time and labor to be made from the regular work of itinerant
		  ministers. Besides, when the next Methodist year comes around there may not be
		  at command such a man as the University would chose for a preacher. President
		  Swain was greatly disappointed at the failure of a scheme which he thought
		  likely to relieve the University from the accusation of being under the
		  influence of two denominations only, Presbyterians and Episcopalians, with the
		  incidental advantage of having his wife's sister a resident of Chapel Hill. It
		  was conjectured by some that Bishop Morris thought that all the energies of his
		  church should be devoted to the upbuilding of Randolph-Macon College.</p>
          <p>The reply of Bishop Morris was regarded as final and the President
		  recommended, with the approval of the Faculty, the election of Rev. Wm. Mercer
		  Green, as Professor of Rhetoric and Logic, with four recitations a week, to be
		  likewise Chaplain. His duties as Chaplain were to preach in the Chapel once a
		  week and to conduct morning prayers throughout the year. Professor Mitchell was
		  to hold evening prayers and of his own motion relieved Mr. Green of one-half of
		  his Sunday morning preaching. The Faculty offered to pay $300 toward the
		  new professor's salary of $1,000, and house rent, but the Trustees
		  refused to accept this liberality. In consideration of being relieved of
		  preaching every alternate Sunday Mr. Green took additional teaching, namely a
		  class in elocution, and coaching the Seniors and Commencement Speakers, besides
		  correcting original speeches and theses.</p>
          <p>Rev. Mr. Green, born in <choice><sic>Wlmington</sic><corr>Wilmington</corr></choice>, was,
		  when elected, Rector of St. Matthew's Episcopal Church in Hillsboro. He had
		  held this charge since 1825. He graduated with high honor in 1818 in the class
		  of which President James K. Polk was the leader. He was particularly
		  distinguished for attention to the <pb xml:id="p456" n="456"/>duties of the
		  Dialectic Society. He was ordered Deacon in 1821 and the next year was ordained
		  Priest. His first charge was St. John's Church, Williamsboro, in Granville
		  County. While at Hillsboro he was Superintendent of a Female School of high
		  standing. He was a man of great industry, the kindliest temper and manners, of
		  fervent piety and faithfulness to every duty. He entered on his labors in
		  1838.</p>
          <p>At the same time a salary of $100 a year was voted the
		  Librarian of the University, Tutor Wm. H. Owen. This was done as it was in
		  contemplation to increase the Library, but though $3,000 was placed at
		  the disposal of the President, and subsequently $1,000 per annum, the
		  appropriation was not expended. I note, however, that $22 was paid for
		  binding eleven volumes of a Greek Lexicon.</p>
          <p>In 1839 it was determined to improve the Campus. Three thousand
		  dollars were voted for the purpose. The money, however, could not have been
		  spent, as no material changes were made. The Societies, by petition, pressed
		  for new halls, offering to pay one-third of the cost.</p>
          <p>THE COMMENCEMENT OF 1839 was on June 27th and was distinguished by the
		  presence of all the ex-Governors of the State, but one. Those present must have
		  been John Branch, James Iredell, John Owen, David L. Swain and Richard Dobbs
		  Spaight, Jr.; the absent being Montfort Stokes, Indian Agent in Arkansas, who
		  died three years afterward.</p>
          <p>The first Chief Marshal was appointed by the Faculty for this
		  Commencement, Thomas Davis Meares of Wilmington, a young man of remarkably fine
		  address and force of character. Doubtless under his management the proceedings
		  moved like clock-work. Of course the appointment was intended to conciliate the
		  defeated Delphian party, of which he was head.</p>
          <p>The first of the Baccalaureate sermons was preached by the Rev.
		  Professor Mitchell. He was chosen by the Faculty, but afterward the choice was
		  given to the Senior class. The election of the Marshal likewise was soon
		  afterward given to the Senior class, the person elected to be a regular member
		  of the Junior class.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p457" n="457"/>
          <p>The Orator before the two Societies was Bedford Brown, then Senator of
		  the United States, an alumnus of 1813. He was elected by the Dialectic Society
		  of which he was a member. Without strong intellect his integrity and force of
		  character, together with devotion to Andrew Jackson, gave him political
		  preferment.</p>
          <p>The Alumni Address was by Hon. Hugh McQueen, an alumnus of 1818, a
		  leading member of the Legislature from Chatham, the next year elected Attorney
		  General, an orator of brilliancy. On account of the recent troubles in the
		  Dialectic Society he urged the students to stand by the two Societies.
		  “They, through every period in the history of the institution have nerved
		  the arm of Collegiate authority by a nice adaption of their respective systems
		  of government to the preservation of decorum, regularity and order.” It
		  is chronicled that the oration was received with “enthusiastic
		  plaudits.”</p>
          <p>The Declaimers of the Freshman class were Peter J. Holmes of Virginia,
		  James J. Morisey, Ashley W. Spaight, Wm. F. Martin, John B. Smith.</p>
          <p>On the part of the Sophomores appeared Wm. J. Clarke, Francis M.
		  Pearson, Robert Strange, Atlas O. Harrison, Joseph J. Norcott, Wm. F. Dancy,
		  John W. Cameron.</p>
          <p>The Declamations were varied by what was known as a
		  “Funny.” This was by special order devolved on John W. Cameron, who
		  delivered an original speech on Summum Bonum. The reporter stated that it
		  abounded with the most delicate touches of satire and humor, which kept the
		  audience in a continual roar. During all his subsequent career his genial
		  temper and wit were conspicuous. The Declaimers of both classes remained to
		  receive their diplomas except Norcott, who was a planter.</p>
          <p>There were six Representatives chosen by the Societies, who delivered
		  original speeches on Wednesday night. There was much excitement in the election
		  of these, the best orators, as a rule, being put forward. On this occasion
		  Francis H. Hawks' subject was on the “Effect of Literature on the Destiny
		  of Man,” John A. Lillington on “Revolutions,” David A. Barnes
		  on “Popular Education,” Calvin H. Wiley on the “Durability
		  <pb xml:id="p458" n="458"/>of Political Institutions,” William H. McLeod on
		  “Slavery,” Isham Garrott on “Literature of the United
		  States.”</p>
          <p>The Faculty awarded the first honor to Alpheus Jones and the second to
		  John A. Maultsby and Angus C. McNeill; the third to Jarvis Buxton, Richard S.
		  Donnell and Dennis D. Ferebee. The class was allowed to add to these four
		  others, so as to have ten speakers in all. Maultsby was a member of the
		  Philanthropic Society and his fellow members of that Society sent to the
		  President an unsigned letter demanding that he should be made equal to Jones.
		  This paper was returned with the statement that the Faculty refused to receive
		  an <choice><sic>annonymous</sic><corr>anonymous</corr></choice>communication, whereupon it appeared
		  again with the signatures of Buxton, Donnell and Ferebee. These were summoned
		  before the Faculty and were addressed firmly, but kindly, urging the
		  impossibility of the surrender to the class of the prerogative of the
		  Professors to pass on class-standings. The Philanthropical Society then
		  intervened, and, after expressing their belief that Maultsby had not received
		  his dues, and, thanking their fellow members of the Senior class for their
		  action, requested them in the interests of peace, harmony and good feeling, to
		  recall their resolutions, which was done. A second interview was had with the
		  committee, and the incident was closed, the President stating that the Faculty
		  were not amenable to the Society, nor <hi rend="italics">vice versa,</hi>and
		  that the students must perform their duties or abide the consequences. He
		  stated his intention to lay the matter before the Trustees. Buxton and Ferebee
		  wrote special letters admitting that their course was wrong. Maultsby felt so
		  aggrieved that he refused to speak or receive a diploma.</p>
          <p>The speeches by the Seniors, who were allowed that privilege, were as
		  follows: Jarvis Buxton, on the “Interference of Government;” Dennis
		  D. Ferebee, on the “Influence of Science on Individual Happiness;”
		  Walter A. Huske, on “Liberty and Law;” John N. Barksdale, on the
		  “Tendency of Governments toward Democracy;” Thomas D. Meares, on
		  “North Carolina and Jefferson;” Isaac N. Tillett, on the
		  “Liberty of the Press;” Alpheus Jones, the
		  “Valedictory.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p459" n="459"/>
          <p>The Annual Address was by Wm. B. Shepard, of the Philanthropic
		  Society, an able lawyer and congressman, who entertained no malice because of
		  his dismissal from the institution in 1816, as heretofore related, for the
		  delivery of a fierce party polemic in defiance of the orders of the President.
		  His subject was “The Value of the Classics in Education,” and was
		  eloquently handled.</p>
          <p>The two Societies agreed to elect some member annually, and
		  alternately from each body to deliver an address before the Alumni and Senior
		  class. The Dialectic Society had the first choice and chose Charles Manly,
		  Esq.</p>
          <p>Evidently this movement was designed to strengthen the Societies which
		  had lost the hearty allegiance of some of the students on account of the
		  temporary Delphian secession. Mr. Manly was very popular and had acted as
		  Chairman of the Committee to induce the Secessionists to return to their
		  allegiance. His address was a successful effort to arouse University and
		  Society pride.</p>
          <p>On reading the annual report President Swain accompanied it with a
		  speech showing in detail the improved condition of the institution.</p>
          <p>Of the honor men, Jones was very promising, but died early of
		  pulmonary consumption; Maultsby, an influential lawyer of this State and
		  Missouri; McNeill, a Presbyterian clergyman of high standing; Buxton, an able
		  Episcopal minister, obtaining the degree of D.D.; Donnell, one of our ablest
		  lawyers and reaching the dignities of Representative in Congress and Speaker of
		  the State House of Representatives; Ferebee was often member of the
		  Legislature, Delegate to the Conventions of 1861 and 1865, and Colonel of
		  Cavalry, C. S. A.</p>
          <p>Of the rest Clark M. Avery was a Colonel, C. S. A., killed in the
		  Wilderness, and Meares a leader in the General Assembly.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates Duncan Kirkland McRae of Fayetteville, was an
		  eloquent orator, an able lawyer and journalist, Consul at Paris, Colonel C. S.
		  A., and Agent of North Carolina in England during part of the Civil War. John
		  Chambers Rankin of Guilford was a Doctor of Divinity, a Missionary to China.
		  Lawrence O'Brien Branch, an Assemblyman in Florida, a Representative in
		  Congress from North Carolina, a Brigadier General C. S. A., killed at
		  Sharpsburg (Antietam).</p>
          <pb xml:id="p460" n="460"/>
          <p>Of those who matriculated this year, Clement G. Wright, Lieutenant
		  Colonel, lost his life in the Confederate cause.</p>
          <p>The Faculty stated that the class was regarded as of very high
		  promise. Until the annunciation of the Senior Report it was composed of
		  thirty-one members. One of them is omitted in the foregoing enumeration and is
		  not included in the recommendations for a degree, for causes known to his late
		  associates and which need not be stated here. This refers to Maultsby, who had
		  been a first honor man up to the Senior year.</p>
          <p>There is a tradition of an amusing nature that Maultsby, before he
		  started for home, determined to give the Professor of Mathematics, Dr. James
		  Phillips, whom he considered to be the author of his loss of the highest class
		  honor, in plain language, his opinion of the injustice and iniquity of which he
		  was the victim. Lying in wait for him as he went to his class, he opened the
		  vials of his wrath. The Professor, afraid of nothing under the sun, taking
		  firmer hold of his knotted cane, which he had the reputation of being able to
		  use scientifically, started upon his adversary with fire in his eye. Maultsby
		  had no intention to strike a man of his age and calling, and, being much
		  superior in agility, ran in a circle around his pursuer, firing at him
		  uncomplimentary epithets, until tired nature ended the pursuit.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on Rev. George W.
		  Freeman, afterward Bishop of Arkansas, and on Rev. Alexander Wilson, head of an
		  excellent classical school. That of Master of Arts on Robert Allison Ezzell,
		  John Hampton and Rev. Drury Lacy, all of North Carolina.</p>

            <p>In the fall of 1840 the Governor, Edward B. Dudley, was requested to

			 were available. Thirty students were during last year forced to seek

            <p>The number of students prior to the Presidency of Caldwell in 1804
			 was not ascertained. Beginning with that year the number from the beginning was
			 stated at 631, and of the matriculates, not graduates, at least that
			 number.</p>
            <p>The system of studies pursued at the University may be gathered from
			 the following statement:</p>
            <p>The Seniors, being excused from recitation before breakfast, had
			 eleven hours of class attendance. One of these was in the Bible Sunday
			 afternoon, President Swain being the teacher. Soon afterward Wayland's Moral
			 Science was substituted.</p>
            <p>The three lower classes had fifteen hours a week, including a Bible
			 recitation on Sunday, Dr. Mitchell having the Juniors, Professor Hooper the
			 Sophomores and Professor Green the Freshmen.</p>
            <p>The President was required to hear seven recitations a week, or
			 perform equivalent scholastic work, “examining or correcting compositions
			 for instance.” Ten recitations were assigned to Professor Mitchell, ten
			 each to the Professors of Rhetoric (Green) and of French (Roberts); to the
			 other members of the Faculty fifteen each.</p>
            <pb xml:id="p463" n="463"/>
            <p>Text books were used in every department and instruction was
			 principally by them. Lectures, written and oral were occasionally delivered in
			 all the departments in the Junior and Senior years, and constituted a
			 considerable portion of the duties performed by President Swain, Professor
			 Mitchell and Professor Phillips.</p>
            <p>The hours and number of recitations per week were as follows:</p>

            <p>The explanation was given that in Chemistry there was a Lecture at 9
			 a. m. succeeded by a recitation at 11 a. m.</p>
            <p>Also that three half days in each week during the Senior year were
			 allowed to the Professor of Chemistry, which were occupied with that science,
			 and in addition Geology and Mineralogy, Technology and the simplest elements of
			 Botany and Zoology, a lecture and a recitation on the same half day.</p>
            <p>There was exhibited sometimes dissatisfaction at such excess of
			 Classics and Mathematics. One Senior class petitioned for substitution of
			 Geography, and another asked for Constitutional Law in place of Greek. Both met
			 with refusal. The correction of composition was sometimes distributed among the
			 Professors.</p>

          <head>TROUBLES OF DISCIPLINE.</head>
          <p>In the fall of 1840 the Professor of Mathematics, Phillips, laid down
		  the rule that text books should not be carried by students into the recitation
		  rooms. At the first meeting of the class thereafter about one-half the class
		  complied. At the third all obeyed except five. At the next eleven appeared with
		  their books. A meeting of the Faculty was then called and the President
		  requested to explain the reasonableness of this rule and the determination to
		  carry it into effect. At the next mathematical recitation twelve broke the
		  rule. The Faculty were convened and the delinquents were called on for their
		  final determination. Nine surrendered and promised obedience, but three,
		  Messrs. Branch, Buchanan and Covington were dismissed. Branch was the son of
		  Governor Branch, who expressed dissatisfaction with the action of the Faculty,
		  whereupon President Swain procured from Dr. William Hooper a statement of an
		  appeal made by him on this subject to the Board of Trustees and of their ruling
		  that each Professor had <pb xml:id="p465" n="465"/>the right to conduct the
		  recitation as he thought best. Branch endeavored to enter Princeton University,
		  and pressed upon the Faculty his right to a statement that he left not under
		  censure. This was refused. Whether he succeeded eventually in his design the
		  record does not show. Covington soon submitted and became a graduate.</p>
          <p>Another trouble during this fall arose from what was called the Fresh
		  Treat. Under the plea that it was an established institution and the new
		  members would be considered niggardly if they refused to pay the two dollars
		  demanded, the materials of a bountiful feast, principally alcoholic liquors,
		  were provided. The result was riots and disorders, during which the windows of
		  the Tutors were shattered, stones were thrown at members of the Faculty, the
		  University bell was rung violently and long, the laboratory and recitation
		  rooms were broken and nearly destroyed, the stables of several Professors
		  entered and the horses ridden. There were four dismissals of upper classmen,
		  but the Freshmen were allowed to take the usual pledge and go free.</p>
          <p>Shortly afterward there was an assemblage in front of the South
		  building, which held a blasphemous revival of religion, calling up mourners,
		  singing ribald songs, ringing the bell, and afterward painting the horses of a
		  Professor, cutting off his mane and tail and placing him in Person Hall. Two
		  students were caught participating in these misdemeanors and were dismissed.
		  They were, however, re-admitted on taking the pledge of penitence and
		  reformation.</p>
          <p>About a fortnight afterward a holocaust was made of all the
		  blackboards in the institution. There were three dismissals for this offence
		  and a resolution passed that in case of any serious outrage on the property of
		  the University, or of any individual, criminal proceedings against the
		  perpetrators should be instituted. This was reported to the Board of Trustees
		  and was approved by them.</p>
          <p>The foregoing statements give an accurate idea of the spirit of
		  mischief among the students in the early part of President Swain's
		  administration. It should be added that some of the <pb xml:id="p466" n="466"/>wild
		  set afterward became valuable members of society, and warm friends of the
		  University. Some became members of the Legislature and Trustees of the
		  University. Good Dr. Mitchell, who was kindly disposed towards errant boys,
		  would often say, “Let him go! Let him go! He is good Legislature and
		  Trustee material.”</p>
          <p>We have a letter from a quite bright, but not very orderly student,
		  one of the best speakers in the institution, written September 23rd, 1840,
		  which paints the attitude of the students to the Faculty in lurid colors. He
		  stated that College was in a state of rebellion. The discipline was for
		  sometime very slack. The result of the lenient system has been that “the
		  strictness of morality has vanished, while at the same time College is much
		  more moral.” He explains this statement by saying that in small things,
		  such as talking in recitation, drinking occasionally, and playing cards once in
		  awhile, the students were more careless of detection, but in addiction to
		  riots, habitual intoxication and gambling, they were completely reformed. The
		  Faculty, however, announced that the cords of discipline must be tightened.
		  This fired the tempers of the students. The Ugly Club was at once organized.
		  When the Faculty attempted to suppress it they were pelted with rocks and
		  compelled to retire. Thereupon Professor Mitchell sallied forth with a sword
		  cane and was again driven back.</p>
          <p>Another regulation was adopted, wrote Mr. Mullins, and it was
		  threatened to apply it to the Sophomore class. He does not state what it was,
		  but from other sources it is learned that it was probably the prohibition
		  against taking text-books, except the classics, into the recitation rooms. The
		  whole class signed an agreement not to submit and sent it to the Faculty. They
		  were required to withdraw it but refused, although “threats,”
		  persuasions and prayers were resorted to.” After three conferences and
		  notifications that dismissal would follow further stubbornness, the Faculty
		  gave way and the class triumphed. President Swain then requested a meeting of
		  the Trustees and the writer fears that this will cause a defeat of the
		  students.</p>
          <p>How much of this narrative is exaggerated it is hard to say. The
		  writer was evidently a leader in the disorders and his animus is shown by his
		  harsh epithets.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p467" n="467"/>
          <p>The records of the Faculty sustain the statements in regard to the
		  misconduct of the “Fresh Treat,” at which spirituous liquors were
		  freely used. Nothing, however, was said of Dr. Mitchell's sword cane, which was
		  probably a hickory stick.</p>
          <p>Not a word is recorded of the defeat of the Faculty by the class. An
		  anonymous letter of that period shows that the Professor of Mathematics
		  (Phillips) was held to be responsible for the new regulation, sundry
		  uncomplimentary epithets being hurled at him, his English birth being alleged
		  as a cause of his severity to the students.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>SALARIES.</head>
          <p>The scale of salaries was fixed as follows:</p>
          <p>The President, $2,000 per annum, with seven recitations each
		  week.</p>
          <p>The Professor of Chemistry, $1,250, with ten recitations.</p>
          <p>Whenever the aggregate amount of tuition per annum shall not be less
		  than $4,000 the Professor of Ancient Languages shall receive
		  $1,250 per annum, with ten recitations per week. The Professor of
		  Mathematics $1,250, with ten recitations; the Professor of Modern
		  Languages $1,000, with ten recitations, and each Tutor $600, with
		  ten recitations each.</p>
          <p>Whenever the tuition receipts shall be less than $5,000 the
		  Professor of Ancient Languages and Mathematics to have $1,400 each, the
		  Professor of Modern Language $1,150, and the Tutors $700
		  each.</p>
          <p>When the tuition receipts shall exceed $6,000 the salaries of
		  the Professors of Ancient Languages and Mathematics shall be $1,500
		  each, and the Professor of Modern Languages $1,250.</p>
          <p>It will be noticed that the salaries of the President and Professor
		  Mitchell were not dependent on tuition receipts. The latter, in addition, was
		  entitled to commissions on receipts, as Bursar. This added about $600 to
		  his salary during the year, and much more afterward.</p>
          <p>It was made obligatory on the Professor of Chemistry to preach in the
		  Chapel every alternate Sunday. The Caldwell residence at the Southeast corner
		  of Raleigh and Franklin Street was set apart for the President and the other
		  places belonging to the University were to be occupied by the Professors
		  <pb xml:id="p468" n="468"/>oldest in office. At the same time the dates of
		  Commencements were to be the first Thursdays in June.</p>
          <p>As throwing light on academical training in the State at that period,
		  I state that out of thirty-two applicants for admission twenty-two, two-thirds,
		  were found deficient in one or more studies, principally in Algebra and the
		  Ancient and Modern Languages. It was agreed to exclude anyone under censure in
		  his school.</p>
          <p>On motion of Professor DeBerniere Hooper the Valedictory was declared
		  to be the highest honor in the future and the Latin Salutatory the next. As a
		  rule, however, it became the practice to group the first, second and third
		  honor men into classes, in which case those in the first class decided by lot
		  which were to have the honorary speeches. Occasionally one was so decidedly
		  superior that he obtained the Valedictory by assignment of the Faculty.</p>
          <p>It was at this time that Dr. Mitchell, who was an amateur Roadmaker
		  and Civil Engineer, in addition to his other accomplishments, presented a plan
		  for making the Raleigh roads enter the campus at the new athletic field and
		  then divide, one branch going by the rear of the South building to Cameron
		  Avenue at Commons Hall; the other, passing by the East building to Franklin
		  street at the west of the Chapel Hill Hotel. The recommendation had such weight
		  with the Trustees that Gerrard Hall, then being built, was made to front to the
		  South, as was evidenced by the porch on that side, with large Doric columns.
		  Those who had business houses on Franklin street, as well as wagoners, who had
		  dealings with them, made a silent, but effective resistance to the change, so
		  the scheme was dropped, leaving the porch on the wrong side of Gerrard Hall, an
		  unsolvable puzzle to future visitors and students. This porch was recently torn
		  down, with a floating intent to rebuild it over the East door.</p>
          <p>AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF 1840 Daniel Moreau Barringer, of the Class of
		  1826, elected to Congress three years afterward, was the Orator, chosen by the
		  Dialectic Society. John Y. Mason of Virginia had agreed to deliver the Address
		  before the Alumni Association, but was unable to be present. Col.
		  <pb xml:id="p469" n="469"/>John D. Long of Halifax supplied his place by an
		  extempore talk, which was much praised.</p>
          <p>The Freshman Declaimers were Walter L. Steele, Leonidas C. Edwards,
		  Wm. Augustus Blount, Robin Ap C. Jones, Robert H. Cowan, John Cowan. On the
		  next night the Sophomores appeared—Richard B. Hill, Joseph M. Bunch,
		  Richard T. Jones, Ashbel G. Brown, Robert P. Dick, John L. Meares. All the
		  declaimers, except Bunch, became graduates.</p>
          <p>The speeches of the Society Representatives were declared by the
		  reporter as burdensome from their length. The names and subjects were: Wm. S.
		  Mullins, on the “Triumph of Free Principles in France;” Rufus
		  Barringer, on the “Extension of the British Empire;” Joseph C.
		  Huske, on “Influence of Christianity on Society;” Richard Don
		  Wilson, on “Influence of Woman;” John F. Flack, on the
		  “Superiority of the Present Over the Past Ages;” James W. Campbell,
		  on the “Influence of Science on Individual Happiness.” The close of
		  the speech of Mullins was long remembered. Speaking of the victory of French
		  Democracy he predicted that the energy and progressive spirit of the new France
		  will fuse with the conservatism of the old, and “the Eagle will bear up
		  the Lily in its onward course to Heaven.”</p>
          <p>After several years' experience it was found that the Society
		  Representatives claimed too wearisome length for their orations. The Faculty
		  therefore abolished this feature of the exercises after 1840. No original
		  speeches were to be delivered in future except by the Seniors. Representatives
		  and Competitors selected by the Faculty were to declaim selections approved by
		  the President or Professor of Rhetoric. This resolution was not to go into
		  effect if the Representatives would agree to shorten their speeches.</p>
          <p>The Faculty were determined not to be accused of partiality as they
		  had been by the friends of Maultsby in 1839. They grouped the honor men into
		  two classes, the first distinction being assigned to William H. Henderson, John
		  A. Lillington, Albert M. Shipp, William M. Shipp and Thomas H. Spruill. To
		  Henderson, however, was given the first honor speech, the <pb xml:id="p470" n="470"/>Valedictory, because he had been among the highest at every
		  examination for four years.</p>
          <p>The second honor came to Daniel B. Currie, Tod Robinson Caldwell, John
		  Worthy Cameron and Francis H. Hawks.</p>
          <p>The third honor men, if there were such, are not recorded.</p>
          <p>The exercises of Commencement Day were as follows:</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>FORENOON.</head>
          <p>Latin Salutatory—Wm. M. Shipp, Lincoln County.</p>
          <p>Duty of Submission to Constitutional Government—Thos. H.
		  Spruill, Warren County.</p>
          <p>Advancement of Literature and Science in North Carolina—Albert
		  M. Shipp, Lincoln County.</p>
          <p>Influence of Poetry in the Formation of Character—John A.
		  Lillington, Wilmington.</p>
          <p>The Responsibility of American Youth—Daniel B. Guthrie, Robeson
		  County.</p>
          <p>Defense of American Character—Tod R. Caldwell, Burke County.</p>
          <p>Duelling—John W. Cameron, Moore County.</p>
          <p>Life and Character of Aaron Burr—Francis H. Hawks, Beaufort
		  County.</p>
          <p>Valedictory—Wm. H. Henderson, Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Of the best scholars William M. Shipp became a popular member of the
		  General Assembly and the Convention of 1861, Attorney-General by vote of the
		  people in 1870 and Judge of the <choice><sic>Superor</sic><corr>Superior</corr></choice>Court;
		  Spruill was a promising lawyer cut off by pulmonary consumption; A. M. Shipp,
		  cousin of William, a Methodist Doctor of Divinity, Professor of History,
		  teaching at different times also French and English literature in this
		  University, Professor in Furman University and Dean of the Theological
		  Department of Vanderbilt University; Lillington was an able lawyer and
		  legislator, dying in middle age; William H. Henderson I have been unable to
		  trace.</p>
          <p>Of the second honor men, Currie was a Presbyterian minister; Caldwell
		  became a prominent lawyer and member of the Assembly, Lieutenant-Governor, and
		  then Governor of North Carolina; Cameron a lawyer, member of the Legislature
		  and <pb xml:id="p471" n="471"/>editor, keeping up a reputation for humor and
		  kindliness to his death. Hawks was a sound lawyer.</p>
          <p>Of those not gaining honors, John W. Cunningham was long a trustee of
		  the University, an able State Senator, a planter and merchant of unbounded
		  influence in his county; David A. Barnes, a wise Legislator and Judge; William
		  Johnston, Railroad President, Mayor of Charlotte, Quarter Mater General of
		  North Carolina; Calvin H. Wiley, a Presbyterian minister, author, and efficient
		  Superintendent of Public Instruction.</p>
          <p>Barnes, Wiley and Samuel J. Proctor were reported as especially
		  distinguished “for ability and punctuality in discharging the duty of
		  composition.”</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on Rev. Nehemiah H.
		  Harding, a Presbyterian divine of this State and of Batchelor of Arts on Walter
		  W. Pharr, of Cabarrus.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates during this year, 1840, Robin Ap Caldwallader
		  Jones, Captain, and James H. McNeill, Colonel, were victims of the Civil
		  War.</p>
          <p>THE COMMENCEMENT OF 1841 was held on June 3rd. The reporter praised
		  the colored walls of the buildings. There was a general air of neatness,
		  marred, however, by the numerous cows and swine frequenting the Campus, an evil
		  promised to be remedied by the rock walls soon to be finished. The grove had
		  been grubbed and the water-boughs of the trees removed. The students had
		  improved greatly in behavior. The music was excellent.</p>
          <p>The address before the two Societies was delivered by Wm. Henry
		  Haywood, a graduate of the class of 1819. Speaker of the House of Commons, a
		  great lawyer, the next year to be Senator of the United States, but to lose his
		  seat and his popularity because he differed from his party on the tariff
		  question. His subject was, “Want of State Pride,” peculiarly
		  appropriate in North Carolina. It was pronounced to be practical, occasionally
		  lighted up by true eloquence.</p>
          <p>The address before the Alumni Association was by James Cole Bruce, of
		  the class of 1825, a man of talent and literary tastes, but hindered from high
		  public career by the possession of thousands of acres of Dan River land and
		  hundreds of slaves. <pb xml:id="p472" n="472"/>He spoke of the causes impeding
		  American Literature. The reporter thought that if the orator succeeded in
		  convincing us of our inferiority to our mother land in Literature and Arts, he
		  left the audience in doubt whether the genuine eloquence they listened to could
		  be surpassed by the writers of that or any other land. His manner was forcible
		  and imposing rather than graceful. The address has recently been reprinted by
		  his descendants.</p>
          <p>The Freshmen Declaimers were DeWitt C. Stone of Franklin, Eugene J.
		  Hinton of Bertie, Owen D. Holmes of Sampson, Jesse P. Smith of Cumberland,
		  James J. Herring of Lenoir, Waller R. Staples of Virginia. On the part of the
		  Sophomores were John Cowan and Robt. H. Cowan of New Hanover, John Ballanfant
		  of Tennessee, Robert T. Fuller of Alabama, William Augustus Blount of Beaufort
		  County, Robert Ap C. Jones of Hillsboro. Of these all graduated except Staples,
		  who obtained his diploma from the University of Virginia.</p>
          <p>There were no Society Representatives, because the students refused to
		  conform to the new regulation as to length of speeches. As a consequence of
		  this clashing the honor of delivering original speeches was confined to the
		  Seniors.</p>
          <p>The Senior class was highly praised for punctuality and good behavior.
		  R. R. Bridgers, W. F. Dancy, A. O. Harrison, A. R. Kelly, A. F. McCree, H.
		  McAllister, Charles and S. F. Phillips were entirely punctual, and of these
		  Bridgers, Dancy, Kelly, McAlister, and Charles and S. F. Phillips were totally
		  free from censure during their University career. It thus appears that good
		  behavior, good scholarship and success in after life went together.</p>
          <p>The first distinction was awarded to Robert R. Bridgers, Wm. F. Dancy,
		  Charles Phillips, Samuel F. Phillips, and James H. Viser; the second to James
		  A. Delk and John Simianer Erwin; the third to Benjamin F. Atkins, Wm. J.
		  Clarke, Wm. W. Green, James A. Long, Francis M. Pearson, Jesse G. Shepard,
		  James F. Taylor and Thomas B. Wetmore. All the honor men were bound to speak on
		  Commencement Day unless excused. Mr. Viser was so excused.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p473" n="473"/>
          <p>Wm. F. Dancy spoke the “Latin Salutatory;” Samuel F.
		  Phillips, on “National Pride;” Robert R. Bridgers, on the
		  “Science of Law;” J. Simianer Erwin, on the “Progress of
		  Constitutional Liberty;” Benjamin F. Watkins, on the “Influence of
		  Circumstances on Character;” Francis W. Pearson, on the “Heroes of
		  the Revolution;” James A. Delk, a French Oration, “<foreign xml:lang="fre">Discours sur la Conquete de Grenade</foreign>;” Jesse G.
		  Shepherd, on the “Character of Alexander Hamilton;” James A. Long,
		  on the “Moral Grandeur of the Bible;” Wm. J. Clarke, the
		  “Mecklenburg Declaration;” Charles Phillips, the
		  “Valedictory.”</p>
          <p>All the first honor men held their preeminence in after life. Bridgers
		  was a strong lawyer and politician, member of the Congress of the Confederate
		  States and then a masterful Railroad President.</p>
          <p>Charles Phillips was an able Professor of Mathematics and a preacher
		  of power. Dancy embraced the profession of law, served two terms in the
		  Legislature, and then devoted his attention to his planting interests. Samuel
		  F. Phillips was one of the ablest lawyers in North Carolina, became Speaker of
		  the House of Commons and Solicitor-General of the United States; Viser was a
		  prominent lawyer of Alabama.</p>
          <p>Of the second honor men, Delk became a Doctor of Laws of Rochester
		  University in New York and of Union College. He was a teacher for fifty years,
		  especially in Colleges for Females; Erwin, a physician of brilliancy, but cut
		  off in early manhood.</p>
          <p>Of those of the third rank Atkins was a lawyer and member of the
		  Legislature. During a heated canvass he had the misfortune to kill his
		  opponent, McDiarmid, as the jury said, in self-defense. He then removed to
		  Texas and there became prominent as a lawyer and politician. William J. Clarke
		  was wounded in the Mexican War, serving as Captain. He was a Colonel in the
		  Confederate service, and after the war a Superior Court Judge. Shepard was a
		  leader in the Democratic party, and a Judge of the Superior Court; John S.
		  Dancy, a member of the Legislature and President of the State Agricultural
		  Society. John W. Ellis was a Judge of the Superior Court and Governor at the
		  outbreak of the Civil War. John F. Hoke was <pb xml:id="p474" n="474"/>State
		  Senator and State Adjutant-General; Montford McGehee, a Commoner and
		  Commissioner of Agriculture; Robert Strange, a Major in the Mexican and
		  Confederate war, State Solicitor and member of the Convention of 1861, of the
		  General Assembly and of the Convention of 1865; Samuel H. Walkup, State Senator
		  and Colonel, C. S. A.; Thomas Ruffin, a Representative in Congress, a
		  Confederate Colonel, killed in battle.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, John H. Dillard reached the Supreme Court as
		  Judge; Isham W. Garrott was in the General Assembly of Alabama,
		  Brigadier-General C. S. A., and killed at Vicksburg; Samuel Hall was Chief
		  Justice of the Supreme Court of Georgia; William J. Hawkins, a physician,
		  President of the Raleigh and Gaston Railroad Company, and of the Citizens
		  National Bank of Raleigh; William Marcellus McPheeters, Professor of Materia
		  Medica in a medical college in St. Louis, an eminent physician.</p>
          <p>In 1839 there belonged to this class a bright, well-mannered youth of
		  popular ways, son of an eminent Democratic editor, who was neglectful of his
		  studies and often involved in the pranks of college life. His next visit to
		  this part of the State was as Lieutenant-General in Sherman's Army, Francis
		  Preston Blair, afterward State Senator and Representative from Missouri and
		  candidate for the Vice-Presidency on the Democratic ticket with Seymour.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates, Josiah E. Bryan, Private; Tristram L. Skinner,
		  Major, and Thomas T. Slade, Captain, were killed in the Civil War.</p>
          <p>As has been stated the French Language ceased to be taught in 1831
		  when Mr. Hentz resigned. The course was resumed in 1836 under the instruction
		  of J. DeBerniere Hooper. Marey taught a few months and then Rev. John James
		  Roberts, a graduate of 1838, who had studied in France for two years, took
		  charge as Professor in 1841. He resigned the next year and Professor J.
		  DeBerniere Hooper resumed his care of the instruction, in addition to his Latin
		  department. He had likewise been the locum tenens in the interval between the
		  going of Marey and the coming of Roberts. A Frenchman, Thomas S. Barshall, was
		  Instructor for a few months in 1842, teaching nothing but French.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p475" n="475"/>
          <p>Dr. Roberts is still living, a retired Episcopal minister. He has done
		  excellent work as Principal of Female Schools in Massachusetts and New York
		  City.</p>
          <p>As heretofore mentioned, a correspondence with John Randolph Clay, our
		  Secretary of Legation at Vienna, resulted in the purchase of an excellent
		  cabinet of minerals for about $1,500. These specimens, notwithstanding
		  some pillaging at the close of the Civil War, are still extremely useful in
		  illustrating the minerals of Europe. The Trustees, as a token of gratitude,
		  conferred the degree of Master of Arts on Mr. Clay in 1845.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>FIRST BIBLES TO GRADUATES OF 1842.</head>
          <p>THE COMMENCEMENT OF 1842 was distinguished by being the first at which
		  Bibles were presented to the members of the graduating class, a laudable custom
		  kept up to this day. On a fly-leaf is the autograph of the President. Not a
		  word of opposition, so far as is known, has ever been uttered by educational or
		  religious critics.</p>
          <p>The Baccalaureate sermon to the Graduating class on this occasion,
		  once called the Valedictory address, was delivered by Rev. Wm. Mercer Green,
		  Professor of Rhetoric and Logic. “It was characterized by great dignity,
		  pathos and unction.” Judge John Y. Mason had agreed to deliver the annual
		  oration before the two Literary Societies, but was prevented by pressure of
		  business. He wrote an admirable letter, however, which was read to the audience
		  by President Swain.</p>
          <p>In consequence of not having the Annual Address, a novel feature,
		  interesting to us on account of scientific achievements since, was introduced.
		  The following is the contemporary account: “The indefatigable Professor
		  of Chemistry, Dr. Mitchell, made various very successful experiments with the
		  fine electro-magnetic apparatus, which the University has lately procured from
		  Boston. He produced powerful and most rapid motion by magnetism alone, and
		  demonstrated the practicability of its application to useful arts, but seemed
		  to think that the cost of copper and zinc (materials indispensable to the
		  excitation of the magnetic influence in such degree as to be useful), would
		  hinder it from coming into competition with steam.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p476" n="476"/>
          <p>Two years afterwards Morse's electro-magnetic telegraph between
		  Washington and Baltimore was successfully tested, but the days of the
		  telephone, phonograph, electric-motors, and other inventions had not come.</p>
          <p>A sad event occurred on Monday afternoon of Commencement week, the
		  death of a bright and attractive girl, 16 years old, Jane, the daughter of Rev.
		  Dr. Alexander Wilson, President of the Caldwell Institute at Greensboro. She
		  had been attending the private school of Mrs. Dr. James Phillips. Her burial
		  was at Chapel Hill, Tuesday afternoon, her funeral sermon being preached by Dr.
		  Phillips.</p>
          <p>It was during this year that the Executive Committee was authorized to
		  establish a Professorship of Law and another of Civil Engineering, but the
		  Committee deemed it premature.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>SECRET FRATERNITIES FORBIDDEN.</head>
          <p>On the 12th of December, 1842, the Board, on motion of Charles L.
		  Hinton, enacted what was styled a “regula generalis” on the subject
		  of secret societies or clubs. They were declared to be “not less
		  injurious to the regularly established Literary Societies in the University
		  than to the cause of good morals and sound learning.” The Faculty was
		  ordered to suppress them, and authorized to receive no student unless on pledge
		  of not joining any such association. This action was supplemented by the two
		  societies, who entered into an agreement to fine heavily any of their members
		  who should break this by-law. During my student life, 1845-49, I never heard of
		  such a society in the institution.</p>
          <p>The Trustees seem to have caught glimpses of unseemly conditions of
		  the rooms of the students. The extraordinary resolution was passed solemnly
		  requesting the Governor of the State to address them on the importance of
		  neatness.</p>
          <p>The Faculty were instructed to change the scheme of recitations so
		  that each student should have sixteen hours per week and one at least every
		  day. This included the Sunday recitation, which was compulsory.</p>
          <p>It seems that the students had been making political speeches. A
		  by-law was passed prohibiting speeches by them except in <pb xml:id="p477" n="477"/>
		  the Society Halls or in the performance of some literary exercise under the
		  sanction of the President.</p>
          <p>The two Societies petitioned for the abolition of Saturday
		  recitations. The Faculty were authorized to grant the request, which was done
		  on the agreement of the Societies to have regular exercises of their own on
		  Saturday mornings. The reading of compositions and declamations was required,
		  debates being on Friday night.</p>
          <p>The Trustees had an exalted opinion of the persuasive powers of
		  Governor Morehead. By resolution, he was requested to attend at the opening of
		  the session in 1843, and explain the principles of the administration of the
		  University and of its punishments. It does not appear that he heeded the
		  request.</p>
          <p>The first honor in this class was awarded to Wm. Alexander Bell,
		  Francis Theodore Bryan, Thomas Junius Morisey, and Nathaniel Hill Quince; the
		  second to Wm. Hooper Haigh, Wm. Figures Lewis, Wm. Francis Martin, Wm. Sidney
		  Mullins, Ashley Wood Spaight, and Joseph John Summerell.</p>
          <p>Mr. Quince was, at his request, excused from speaking. Morisey
		  obtained the Valedictory and Bryan the Salutatory by lot. The rest delivered
		  original speeches, Rufus Barringer being chosen, on account of his powers of
		  oratory, to take the place of Quince.</p>
          <p>The speeches on Commencement day were as follows:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, Francis T. Bryan, of Wake.</p>
          <p>“Principles of the Old Federal Party,” Rufus
		  Barringer.</p>
          <p>“Obligations of Educated Men,” Joseph J. Summerell,
		  Northampton.</p>
          <p>“Spirit of Reform,” Wm. H. Haigh, Fayetteville.</p>
          <p>“Reciprocal Influence of Science and Religion,” Wm. F.
		  Lewis, Edgecombe.</p>
          <p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">Eloge de Louis Philippe</foreign>,”
		  Wm. A. Bell, Alabama.</p>
          <p>“Reverence for the Past,” Wm. F. Mullins,
		  Fayetteville.</p>
          <p>“The Middle Ages,” Wm. F. Martin, Elizabeth City.</p>
          <p>The Valedictory, Thomas J. Morisey, Clinton.</p>
          <p>The newspaper of the day says that the orations were distinguished by
		  manly good sense and graceful elocution. Complaint was made that the attendance
		  of the Trustees was meagre, <pb xml:id="p478" n="478"/>but there were large praises
		  for the refinement of the visitors and the management of the institution.</p>
          <p>The Faculty record states that as a whole the class maintained an
		  extraordinary reputation for punctuality, “yet there are various
		  individuals who will not be able in after life to recur to the tables of
		  absences without emotions both of surprise and regret.” An inspection of
		  the tables justified this ominous prediction, though it is hardly possible that
		  the eyes of the offenders ever rested on the doleful record. One individual has
		  to his account 148 absences from Recitation, 90 from Prayers, and 18 from
		  Church. Another 183, 190, and 19, another 132, 250, and 33, a fourth 119, 241,
		  and 23, a fifth 54, 200, and 26, absences from those functions respectively.
		  Only one Senior, Wm. W. Green, afterwards physician of Granville County, was
		  perfectly punctual for four years.</p>
          <p>Of the honor men, Bell became a lawyer in Alabama, volunteered in the
		  Mexican War, and died in 1850. Bryan entered at West Point, was No. 6 at
		  graduation, was First Lieutenant for gallant conduct at Buena Vista, where he
		  was wounded. He resigned from the army and is a prominent and wealthy citizen
		  of St. Louis, Missouri. Morisey was a leading lawyer of the Cape Fear section
		  and a useful member of the General Assembly. Quince died early.</p>
          <p>Of the second rank, Haigh was an esteemed lawyer, Lewis an influential
		  planter and among the most useful Justices in his county; Martin was one of the
		  best lawyers in the State, a trusted legislator, a Colonel in the Confederate
		  Army; Mullins was a brilliant speaker at the bar and in the Legislature of
		  South Carolina and president of a railroad company; Spaight was a lawyer and
		  legislator in Texas, Brigadier-General in the Confederate service, and
		  Secretary of State; Summerell a physician of eminence in Salisbury; Barringer
		  was a sound lawyer, a broad-minded legislator, and an intrepid
		  Brigadier-General in Hampton's Cavalry. His standing as a student was only
		  respectable, his attention being mainly directed to composition and debates in
		  his Society, the Dialectic. He has delivered valuable historic addresses.</p>
          <p>Only one of the matriculates was a victim of the Confederate war,
		  William L. Johnson.</p>

          <head>THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH</head>
          <p>was organized May 13, 1842, under the name of the Church of the
		  Atonement, Chapel Hill, N. C., agreeing to be governed by the Constitution and
		  Canons of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States. The following
		  males signed the agreement: Archibald M. Hooper, T. Lloyd Moore, John J.
		  Roberts, Manuel Fetter, John DeB. Hooper, Stephen S. Green, John M. Craig,
		  Robert T. Hall, Wm. M. Green, Jr., George Moore, Johnston B. Jones, James S.
		  Green, and the following females, Charlotte Hooper, Mary F. Waddell, Anne C.
		  Hall, Mary E. Hooper, Matilda A. Williams, Mary W. Green, Mary W. Hall,
		  Elizabeth Craig, Catharine S. Waddell, Charlotte S. Green, and Mrs.
		  —— Jones. Although he was originator and guide of the movement, and
		  although the names of four of his children are in the list, Rev. Wm. M. Green
		  did not sign the paper. It is probable that he signed another as Rector de
		  facto.</p>
          <p>Of the founders of the church, Archibald M. Hooper, late of
		  Wilmington, lived with his son, Prof. J. DeB. Hooper, and Charlotte Hooper,
		  born DeBerniere, was his wife. Mary F. Waddell, born Fleming, was the wife of
		  Haynes Waddell, afterwards of Hillsboro. Her sister Charlotte was the wife of
		  Professor Green. Mary E. Hooper was wife of Professor Hooper, being a daughter
		  of Rev. Dr. Wm. Hooper. Mrs. Anne C. Hall was widow of William, son of Judge
		  John Hall of the Supreme Court. Catharine S. Waddell was a daughter of Mr. and
		  Mrs. Haynes Waddell, marrying afterwards Dr. James S. Green.</p>
          <p>The Parish retained the name of the Church of the Atonement until its
		  consecration by Bishop L. S. Ives in the fall of 1848, when at his instance the
		  name adopted was “the Parish of the Chapel of the Cross.” While the
		  church was being built, the congregation worshipped in the parlor of Professor
		  Green as a rule, occasionally in that of Prof. Hooper. The building was carried
		  on mainly by the energy of Professor Green, who, besides obtaining funds,
		  contributed most generously out of his slender means. The design was by Upjohn
		  of New York, architect. There were four pinnacles on the <pb xml:id="p480" n="480"/>
		  tower, but when one was blown down the others were removed. The building is
		  pronounced by experts to be very beautiful in its proportions.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1843 the Declaimers selected from the Freshman
		  class for Tuesday evening were Joseph L. Bozman, William J. Cannon, Edward H.
		  Hicks, James Holmes, David T. Tayloe and Owen H. Whitfield. Those from the
		  Sophomore class for Wednesday evening were Isaac C. Carrington, James J.
		  Herring, Eugene J. Hinton, Virginius H. Ivy, Jesse P. Smith, Owen D. Holmes.
		  All of the Declaimers remained to receive their diplomas except Bozman, Cannon,
		  James Holmes and Carrington.</p>
          <p>The number of Trustees was greater than usual. Dr. John Hill of
		  Wilmington, A.B. in 1814, delivered the Annual Address. The contemporary
		  estimate was that “it displayed refined humanity, philosophical enquiry,
		  manly piety, liberal accomplishment, the proper fruit of the early lessons of
		  his Alma Mater. All these characterized and enriched this noble
		  production.”</p>
          <p>There were no Trustees at the examinations prior to Commencement week.
		  A novel feature was the examination of all the classes on the Holy Scriptures
		  by the Faculty in presence of Governor Morehead on Monday of that week. On the
		  forenoon of Tuesday by President Swain in presence of the Governor, John D.
		  Hawkins and Secretary Charles Manly, all Trustees, the Senior class was
		  examined on Constitutional and International Law. All of the 33 members of the
		  class obtained their diplomas, although six, for various valid reasons, were
		  not present at the final examinations.</p>
          <p>The first distinction was conferred on Joseph Caldwell Huske, Walter
		  Waightstill Lenoir and Samuel Jones Person. It was announced that John Luther
		  Bridgers would have been in the same rank, if he had not been absent on account
		  of sickness one-half of the Senior and part of the Junior years. Walter W.
		  Lenoir was a grandson of General Wm. Lenoir, the first President of the Board
		  of Trustees in 1790.</p>
          <p>The second honor was assigned to Ashbel Green Brown, Robert Paine
		  Dick, Richard Thomas Jones, James Warren

		  Henry Sanders; the third to James Augustus Leak and John London Meares.</p>
          <p>The graduating speeches were as follows:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, Joseph C. Huske.</p>
          <p>“Moral Influence in Science,” Joseph McClees.</p>

		  Samuel J. Person.</p>
          <p>“Bonds of Society,” with the Valedictory, Walter W.
		  Lenoir.</p>
          <p>As usual, the Valedictory and Salutatory were assigned by lot among
		  the first-honor men.</p>
          <p>All of the first-honor men attained distinction in after life. Huske,
		  an Episcopal minister of great worth, became a Doctor of Divinity; Lenoir was
		  an esteemed lawyer, planter, Captain in the Confederate Army and wise
		  legislator; Person was a very able member of the Legislature, and Judge of the
		  Superior Court; Bridgers was a sound lawyer, Commissioner to the Confederate
		  Government at Montgomery, a planter, and Colonel in the Confederate Army. Of
		  the second rank, Brown was an efficient Assistant Professor of Latin in the
		  University; Dick, a Judge of the Supreme Court of North Carolina and of the
		  Federal District Court; Lancaster, a good lawyer and member of the Legislature,
		  as was McClees; Sanders was a member of the General Assembly and
		  Lieutenant-Colonel C. S. A. Of the third-honor men, Leak was president of a
		  bank, a planter, and afterwards Senator from his county; and Meares a prominent
		  physician in San Francisco.</p>
          <p>Of those who received no honors, Thomas O. D. Walker was a lawyer and
		  energetic President of the Wilmington, Charlotte and Rutherford Railroad
		  Company; Thomas D. S. McDowell was a State Senator and Representative, in the
		  Convention <pb xml:id="p482" n="482"/>of 1861, and member of the Confederate
		  Congress; and John Haywood Manly, Colonel in the Confederate Army and Mayor of
		  Galveston, Texas.</p>
          <p>There were eight victims of the Civil War who matriculated in 1843,
		  viz.: John A. Benbury, Captain; Edwin L. Dusenbury, Private; Peter G. Evans,
		  Colonel; Elias C. Hines, Corporal; J. Johnston Pettigrew, Brigadier-General;
		  Thomas J. Sharp, Captain; John H. Stone, Private; John H. Whitaker, Major.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1844.</head>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1844 the Freshman Declaimers were Thomas I.
		  Sharpe, Lionel L. Levy, Eli W. Hall, William Henry Manly, John A Benbury, John
		  Pool. Those from the Sophomore class were Richard W. Forbes, Lucian Holmes,
		  John Napoleon Daniel, Edward Hubbell Hicks, Owen W. Whitfield, Richard T.
		  Weaver. The speeches were mainly selections from Webster, Clay, Pinckney,
		  Sprague, Ames, and Shakespeare. All in due course obtained diplomas, except
		  Sharpe and Benbury. Both were Captains in the Confederate service and were
		  killed in battle, the former in the Southwest, the latter at Malvern Hill.
		  Benbury was a very useful member of the Legislature.</p>
          <p>The address before the Historical Society was eloquent and
		  instructive, by the Right Reverend Levi Silliman Ives, Bishop of the Protestant
		  Episcopal Church. His theme was the guidance of the Almighty as shown in
		  history. At the close he ventured an explanation of the generally conceded
		  honesty of our State. He attributed it first to the soundness of our
		  controlling minds, second to the poverty of our soil, “too poor to allow
		  in anyone idleness or prodigality. Property is slowly acquired and slowly
		  diffused.” The Bishop grew pessimistic, “There are some sad
		  symptoms of a turn in the tide of our honorable, although humble, advance. We
		  have manifestly become infected with the national contagion, the money-getting
		  mania, now the blighting curse of our whole country. . . . Oh! what must be the
		  end of the generation now living in our midst, absorbed as it seems in the
		  thoughts and acquisition of earth!”</p>
          <p>The orator before the Societies was James Biddle Shepard of the Class
		  of 1834. His address was well received, well written, often eloquent, and well
		  delivered. It was probably <pb xml:id="p484" n="484"/>the cause of his nomination
		  two years afterwards as the Democratic candidate for the office of Governor
		  against the incumbent, William A. Graham, the latter being elected. It was
		  noticed that he delivered his oration with his hands gloved in kid, with a ring
		  on one of his fingers, a style quite unusual.</p>
          <p>The following are the names and subjects of the Senior speakers:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, George B. Wetmore.</p>
          <p>“State Sovereignty,” James S. Johnston.</p>
          <p>“Genius—Fuller and Whitney,” Wm. F. Barbee.</p>
          <p>“Columbus,” John H. Bryan.</p>
          <p>“Influence of Literature on Science,” Robert H. Cowan.</p>
          <p>“Our Navy,” Alfred G. Foster.</p>
          <p>“The Deaf and Dumb,” Pleasant H. Dalton.</p>
          <p>“Influence of Moral Principles on the Intellect,” John
		  Ballanfant.</p>

          <p>“Prison Discipline,” Exum L. Whitaker.</p>
          <p>“Parties in our Country,” Robert T. Fuller.</p>
          <p>“Right of Instruction,” Walter L. Steele.</p>
          <p>“Mutual Interests of Individuals and Society,” with the
		  Valedictory, Stephen Addison Stanfield.</p>
          <p>Robert H. Cowan, James Hunter Horner, James Sterling Johnston, Stephen
		  Addison Stanfield and George Badger Wetmore obtained the first honor. The
		  second honor men were Wm. Franklin Barbee, William Smith Battle, Pleasant
		  Hunter Dalton, Robert Thomas Fuller, Edward Bulkley Lewis, Walter Leak Steele,
		  and Exum Lewis Whitaker. The third honor went to John Ballanfant, John
		  Herritage Bryan and Alfred Gaither Foster.</p>
          <p>Nearly all of the honor men had successful careers. Cowan was a good
		  lawyer, legislator and railroad president, as well as a brave and resourceful
		  Colonel; Horner was founder of the celebrated Horner School at Oxford;
		  Johnston, a most promising lawyer, with the elements of a great man, died
		  early; Stanfield was a Presbyterian minister of high repute, and
		  <pb xml:id="p485" n="485"/>Wetmore, first a lawyer and then an active and useful
		  Episcopal minister. Of the second rank, Battle was a large planter and cotton
		  manufacturer, and member of the Convention of 1861; Dalton was a devoted
		  Presbyterian minister; Fuller a Judge in Arkansas; Lewis, an efficient teacher,
		  dying early; Steele an active politician, serving two terms in Congress, a
		  cotton manufacturer, a most valuable Trustees of the University. He was
		  Secretary of the Convention of 1861. Whitaker was a Captain in the Mexican War,
		  lost his life in Mexico from disease. Of the third rank, Ballanfant was a
		  leading planter and member of the Tennessee Legislature, and Foster stood high
		  as a lawyer and legislator, dying in middle life.</p>
          <p>It was stated by President Swain that one of the first honor men,
		  Johnston, had attended every duty, Prayers, Recitations, and Church, for four
		  years, nearly 5,000 in number.</p>
          <p>Of those who did not obtain honors, Leonidas C. Edwards is a leader of
		  the bar and was prominent in the General Assembly, a Colonel in the Confederate
		  service. William H. Hinton was also prominent in the Legislature and much
		  sought after as a political speaker, described by a listener as “flying a
		  magnificent spread-eagle.” Thomas Ruffin was one of the most adroit
		  verdict-winners in the State, a Colonel C. S. A., and Judge of a Military
		  Court. He was afterwards a Judge both of the State Superior and Supreme
		  Courts.</p>
          <p>Of those who did not graduate, Hill Burgwin attained eminence as a
		  lawyer in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on Rev. Albert Baldwin
		  Dod, of New Jersey, Presbyterian preacher, author, and Professor of Mathematics
		  in Princeton University, and on Rev. Robert Brent Drane, Episcopal minister in
		  Wilmington, N. C.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates, who lost their lives in the Civil War, were James
		  J. Iredell, Major; Edward M. Scott, Captain, and Leonidas C. Ferrell,
		  Surgeon.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY.</head>
          <p>In 1833 an Act was passed to incorporate the North Carolina Historical
		  Society. The incorporators were James Iredell, David L. Swain, Alfred Moore,
		  Joseph S. Jones (Shocco), Louis <pb xml:id="p486" n="486"/>D. Henry, Isaac T.
		  Avery, Joseph A. Hill, Wiliam D. Mosely and Richmond M. Pearson. Nothing was
		  done to carry this Act into effect.</p>
          <p>In January, 1844, President Swain and his Professors and Tutors
		  published some facts of the history of our State, especially in Colonial times,
		  stating that a Historical Society had been formed, President Swain being
		  President, the Professors being Executive Committee, Tutor Ralph H. Graves
		  being Treasurer and Librarian, and Tutor A. G. Brown Secretary. It was
		  announced that the first meeting would be on June 5, 1844, and that the
		  Introductory Address would be delivered by Bishop Levi Silliman Ives.</p>
          <p>The object of the Society was quite ambitious, viz.: 1st, to obtain
		  from England documents throwing light on the Proprietary government; 2d, to
		  collect and preserve every book, pamphlet and newspaper published in this State
		  since the introduction of the Press in 1749; 3d, all books published in our own
		  and foreign countries on the History of North Carolina, and especially all
		  documents relating to the American Revolution.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding these important objects, it is remarkable that there
		  was no charter, no organization, no effort to obtain members, other than the
		  Faculty. In a short while the co-operation even of the Professors and Tutors
		  was dispensed with, except those President Swain called on specially.
		  Occasionally eminent men, by invitation of the Faculty, delivered addresses at
		  Commencements before this mythical Society and the assembled company, but no
		  meeting was held.</p>
          <p>On the belief that the Society was an entity, a live organization,
		  valuable books and documents were presented to it. A list of part of these I
		  give in my narrative of 1846. The President was active and successful in
		  procuring letters of men prominent in the State. When he could not obtain gifts
		  of such he solicited loans, which were seldom returned. A story is told of a
		  Mr. Webb journeying many miles in order to recover the family papers—all
		  in vain, for the borrower “talked him out of them.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p487" n="487"/>
          <p>Among the documents, books and papers gathered was a valuable
		  collection made by Judge Murphey, which, after his death went by loan into the
		  possession of Jos. Seawell Jones, who was writing his Defence of North
		  Carolina. When he removed to Mississippi he left the treasure in the vault of
		  the Branch Bank of Cape Fear at Raleigh. President Swain obtained the
		  co-operation of Governor Graham and induced the Cashier to turn it over to him.
		  Among other things the box contained the Revolutionary History of General
		  Joseph Graham, and many papers relating to the so-called War of the Regulation.
		  It was from the latter that the President was enabled to prepare for the
		  <hi rend="italics">University Magazine</hi>his valuable contribution to the
		  history of that movement.</p>
          <p>I anticipate my history by mentioning here that President Swain did
		  not name in his will this collection. His executrix, Mrs. Swain, finding the
		  Historical Society papers and books on her husband's bookshelves, claimed them
		  as her own, sold many valuable autographs, but ultimately surrendered to the
		  University a considerable portion. This transaction will be narrated in detail
		  in my second volume.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE OF 1844.</head>
          <p>In 1844 for the first time a North Carolina University Magazine was
		  launched on the literary sea and had an honorable existence of one year. It was
		  fathered by the Senior class and edited by a committee, namely, Edmund DeBerry
		  Covington, of Richmond County, Robert H. Cowan, of Wilmington, and Samuel F.
		  Phillips, of Chapel Hill, of the Dialectic Society, and James S. Johnston, of
		  Halifax, Leonidas C. Edwards, of Person County, and a third, probably George B.
		  Wetmore, of Fayetteville, or William H. Hinton, of Bertie. This uncertainty
		  shows the modesty of the editors, whose names are not on the pages of the
		  issues. All were Seniors except Mr. Phillips, who was a Post-graduate, studying
		  for the legal profession. These were strong men and appear to have labored with
		  diligence. They certainly produced a very creditable journal. Tradition differs
		  as to the leading spirit, some giving the honor to Covington, others, in my
		  opinion most justly, to Phillips.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p488" n="488"/>
          <p>The following list of a portion of the contents will give some idea of
		  this first literary venture by the students. They are preceded by an
		  “Address to Patrons.” The magazine is commended “as a
		  voluntary offering, as a token of devotion to Literature. We present it as a
		  flower in the bud. It is for you to determine whether it shall wither and die
		  from neglect, or increase in beauty and fragrance, and expand under the genial
		  sunshine of public favor.”</p>
          <p>There is a great deal of value in the twelve numbers of this magazine.
		  The criticisms seem just and well written. In history I instance the articles
		  on Macaulay's Miscellanies, the eulogy of “Judge Gaston” by Judge
		  Battle, on Prescott's Conquest of Mexico, on the Life of Lewis Cass, on the
		  origin of the Ruined Cities of America, on Western Europe and Hindostan, on
		  Biblical Researches in Palestine. There were proceedings of various
		  Revolutionary Committees of Safety, such as Rowan and Wilmington, History of
		  the University, Life of President Caldwell, the so-called Battle of
		  Elizabethtown, Life of Col. Wm. McRae, of Alfred Moore by Chief Justice Taylor,
		  of Abel P. Upshur, of Thomas W. Gilmer, Indexes to Colonial Documents, and
		  formation of the North Carolina Historical Society. We find Questions of the
		  Constitution, politics, and economics discussed, for example, a dissertation on
		  Rural Economy, the Influence of the University on the State, Our Federal
		  Judiciary, the Constitution of the United States, Common schools in North
		  Carolina, The Legitimacy of Government, The Spirit of Democracy, Slave Labor in
		  the Southern States. Social questions are also intelligently handled, such as
		  Influence of Circumstances, Wandering Thoughts, Shaking Quakers, The Lawyer,
		  Tea Parties, The College Loafer, the Duty of Man, The Influence of Woman, The
		  Medical Profession, Responsibility of Educated Men. Scientific questions are
		  subordinate, as might be expected from the University curriculum of that day.
		  We find, however, an article on Phrenology, on Immortality of Brutes, the Study
		  of the Natural Sciences. Three able Commencement addresses add to the value of
		  the volume, by Bishop Ives on the Presence of God in History, and by James B.
		  Shepard and William Gaston on the Duties of <pb xml:id="p489" n="489"/>American
		  Citizens. A letter of Chief Justice Marshall is printed, strongly praising
		  Judge Gaston's address, which was a reprint of that delivered in 1832, and
		  timely because of his recent death.</p>
          <p>Romance of course found a place in this periodical. We have the Legend
		  of College Point; An Incident at Sea; Caroline Lee—a Revolutionary
		  Sketch; Maiden of the Old Dominion; An Allegory; The Rose Trees.</p>
          <p>Psychological speculations fared meagrely in these papers. Articles on
		  Mythology, on Ambition, Coleridge's Confession of an Enquiring Spirit, showed
		  what the writers could have done if they had been minded.</p>
          <p>The magazine would not have been complete without studies in Poetry
		  and occasional flights to Parnassus. We find an essay on American Poetry, Short
		  Poems of Governor Alexander Martin on General Nash and Governor Caswell, an ode
		  in imitation of the Scotch on the “Auld Poplar Tree in the Campus,”
		  a well-thought criticism on Shelley and his poetry; a melancholy moan entitled,
		  “No More, No More, No Never More,” a stirring story of the
		  “Smuggler's Escape,” a hairraising “Dream”; which is
		  relieved by cheerful lines on a “Sycamore Tree,” an appeal to
		  “Miss Anna,” and to “The Ladies,” while we are gently
		  led to the spring of life by “Young Heart's Love.” Passing by those
		  shorter pieces, I note a poem of twenty-nine verses of decided merit on
		  Thermopylæ. It was by a young law student, afterwards Solicitor-General
		  of the United States. It shows not only classical learning, but genuine
		  poetical talent, and if it had been published in a Harvard or Yale Magazine by
		  one of their students, would have attracted wide praise. The author was one of
		  the editors, Mr. Phillips, as tradition avers. The names of the writers are not
		  printed.</p>
          <p>I give one extract from the <hi rend="italics">Magazine,</hi>a poem
		  on the Old Poplar, under which, tradition says, the Commissioners of Location
		  partook of their lunch. Although the poet sang its funeral dirge, it is hale
		  and hearty after sixty-two years, having survived a fierce stroke of lightning
		  and the rending off <pb xml:id="p490" n="490"/>by a storm of most of its top
		  branches. The author was E. B. Covington.</p>

          <p>The magazine died for lack of support. No periodical, other than
		  political or religious, has ever in our State brought to its projector income
		  sufficient to pay expenses. At that time, too, the depressed financial
		  condition consequent on the panic of 1837 had not passed away. After a few
		  months we hear from the editors such laments as, “What reason have they
		  of hope when it (the magazine) goes forth upon the tideless sea of literary
		  apathy and insensibility, where none know or care for its incomings or its
		  outgoings, and its merits, if any, are doomed to perish as “the flower
		  that's born to blush unseen”? At the request of the printer, Thomas
		  Loring, the Indexes to Colonial Documents and Proceedings of the Safety
		  Committees took the place of the last two numbers, and the editors bade a final
		  farewell in touching words.</p>
          <p>Mr. Loring assumed the risk of publication, promising twelve numbers
		  of forty-eight pages each, the price being three dollars. He was accustomed, if
		  matter furnished did not fill out the promised space, to supply the deficiency
		  with his own selections. He lost money by the venture, but it is said that
		  President Swain reimbursed him to some extent at least. If so, he probably drew
		  on the fund derived from payments for diplomas, which were under his
		  disposal.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE ALUMNI ASSOCIATION.</head>
          <p>The second meeting of the Alumni Association was on the 5th of June,
		  1844, Governor Morehead presiding. Charles Phillips was elected Secretary.
		  There were twenty-four Alumni present and 27 new were added, in all 51. On
		  motion of Hugh Waddell, all matriculates, whether graduates or not,
		  <pb xml:id="p492" n="492"/>might be admitted on vote, as honorary members, entitled
		  to all the privileges of graduates. Eight were admitted under this resolution,
		  including President Swain.</p>
          <p>The Committee on the Constitution made their report. The name was The
		  Alumni Association of the University of North Carolina. Its objects were to
		  renew and perpetuate the friendships formed in their collegiate course, to
		  promote the interests of their Alma Mater, and the cause of education
		  generally. The members were those graduates who joined the Association in 1843,
		  and others admitted by a unanimous vote. There was to be an annual meeting on
		  the day preceding Commencement, at which the President, six Vice-Presidents, a
		  Secretary, Treasurer, and Executive Committee were to be chosen, who were to
		  hold office for one year and until their successors should be elected. By-laws
		  could be adopted by a majority vote.</p>
          <p>The first officers were John M. Morehead, President; Charles L.
		  Hinton, W. A. Graham, Hugh Waddell, John D. Hawkins, the elder, Lucius Polk,
		  and Wm. H. Haywood, Jr., Vice-Presidents; Rev. W. M. Green, W. H. Battle, and
		  J. DeB. Hooper, Executive Committee; Charles Phillips, Secretary, and Ashbel G.
		  Brown, Treasurer. The Executive Committee were authorized to select an orator
		  for the next Commencement.</p>
          <p>An abortive scheme was unanimously adopted by the Faculty on the 27th
		  of January, 1844, when they passed resolutions appropriate to the memory of
		  Judge Wm. Gaston, lately deceased, for 42 years a wise and useful Trustee of
		  the University. They requested that the Board would allow them to inaugurate a
		  burial ground in plain view of the buildings, and they asked the relatives of
		  Judge Gaston to allow his body, then temporarily resting in Raleigh, to be
		  interred in this cemetery. It was promised that efforts would be made to remove
		  to this spot the remains of other men prominent in our history, “with the
		  high and noble object of keeping before the youth of the institution such ever
		  present remembrances of the great as may incite them to a vigorous prosecution
		  of their studies and assiduous cultivation of their hearts.” The letter
		  to the Trustees was eloquently written by Professor Deems and signed by him and
		  Professor Green. The graves, then almost <pb xml:id="p493" n="493"/>forgotten, of
		  Governor Caswell and General Nash, are especially mentioned. The Faculty
		  evidently did not count the cost of this pious enterprise, but the Trustees,
		  more practical, gave it a respectful quietus.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1845.</head>
          <p>The chronicler grew enthusiastic over the Commencement of 1845.
		  “A more imposing and brilliant occasion had never been witnessed in the
		  republic of letters in North Carolina.” The numbers were at least 1,500.
		  The ladies, more numerous than ever, “gave beauty and
		  cheerfulness.” The Trustees present were Governor Graham, ex-Governor
		  Morehead, President Swain, James Mebane, Dr. James Webb, John D. Hawkins, Judge
		  Battle, Charles Manly, Hugh Waddell, Dr. James S. Smith, John H. Bryan, Louis
		  D. Henry, Charles L. Hinton, Robert B. Gilliam, Nicholas L. Williams, George F.
		  Davidson, Weston R. Gales.</p>
          <p>The first exercise in order was the Baccalaureate sermon by Rev. Mr.
		  Gilchrist, of Fayetteville, which was sound and inspiring.</p>
          <p>The Freshman Declaimers were Henry G. Williams, Thomas C. Pinkard,
		  James Gallier, Thomas H. Holmes, Thomas E. Watson, John K. Strange, John W.
		  Cameron.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore Competitors on the next evening were Lionel L. Levy,
		  William M. Howerton, Eli W. Hall, Elias C. Hines, John Pool, Leonidas C.
		  Ferrell, Wm. Henry Manly.</p>
          <p>Six of the two classes of Declaimers were from different States. All
		  became graduates except Williams, Pinckard, Gallier, and Ferrell.</p>
          <p>The Marshals, Stephen F. Poole, of Alabama, Chief, and his aids,
		  popularly known as Subs, Wm. A. Daniel of Halifax, Richard N. Forbes of
		  Newbern, Lucian Holmes of Pittsboro, and William B. Meares of Wilmington were
		  particularly praised. They wore gorgeous regalia, the blue predominating in
		  that worn by the Dis and white in that worn by the Phis.</p>
          <p>The Orator was the Rev. Thomas F. Davis, of the class of 1822,
		  afterward Bishop of South Carolina. His subject was, “The Capacious
		  Powers of the Mind and Duty of Cultivating Them,” and was ably
		  handled.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p494" n="494"/>
          <p>The first distinction in the Senior class of '39 was assigned to
		  Joseph Branch Batchelor, Thomas Frederck Davis, Frederick Divous Lente, Jesse
		  Potts Smith, and George Vaughan Strong. The second rank contained Edward
		  Dromgoole, Richard Henry Mason, and Thomas Jethro Sumner. In the third rank
		  were Ralph Potts Buxton, Peter Garland Burton, James Joshua Herring, and Reuben
		  Clarke Shorter. It was announced that Davis, Smith and Strong had been first at
		  every examination for four years. Batchelor was first during three years, but
		  was absent from sickness during the Sophomore year. Thomas Edward Whyte would
		  have been second if he had not been absent from sickness at the close of the
		  Senior session.</p>
          <p>Batchelor <choice><sic>obtaned</sic><corr>obtained</corr></choice>the Valedictory by lot
		  and Davis the Latin Salutatory. The programme for the exercises of the Senior
		  Class was as follows:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, Thomas F. Davis.</p>
          <p>“Public Opinion Enlightened,” Thomas J. Sumner.</p>
          <p>“Greek Tragedy,” Edward Dromgoole.</p>
          <p>“Pleasures of Literature,” James J. Herring.</p>
          <p>“Tendencies of Ultraism,” P. Garland Burton.</p>
          <p>“True Theory of the Constitution,” Fred. D. Lente.</p>
          <p>“Periodical Literature of North Carolina,” Ralph P.
		  Buxton.</p>
          <p>“Influence of National Insignia,” Reuben C. Shorter.</p>
          <p>“All is Vanity,” George V. Strong.</p>
          <p>“Incompetency of the Reason to Control the Passions,”
		  Jesse P. Smith.</p>
          <p>“Grandeur of the Missionary Character,” Richard H.
		  Mason.</p>
          <p>“Responsibilities of Talent,” with the Valedictory, Joseph
		  J. Batchelor.</p>
          <p>Gerrard Hall was described as being brilliant. The narrator dropped
		  into poetry.</p>
          <lg type="poem">
            <l>“Minerva's Hall well shone that night</l>
            <l>With beauty's glowing splendors.</l>

            <l>On our country's true defenders.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The President reported that with the exception of the expulsion of two
		  students “whose conduct was of the most rebellious and violent character,
		  the action of the University through all its arteries is sound and
		  healthy.”</p>

          <pb xml:id="p495" n="495"/>
          <p>Following the honor men in after life we find that Batchelor became
		  Attorney General and one of the ablest chamber lawyers in the State. Davis, son
		  of the Bishop of South Carolina, a faithful minister in the Episcopal Church,
		  dying early; Lente, Professor of Gynecology in the New York University, Founder
		  and President of the American Academy of Medicine; Smith died early; Strong was
		  an excellent lawyer and Judge, also a leader in the Legislature, distinguished
		  himself in procuring the revival of the University. Soon after graduation he
		  published a booklet of poems, which he endeavored to suppress, as inconsistent
		  with the standing of a man of business.</p>
          <p>Of the second honor men Mason became a useful and learned, but not
		  eloquent, Episcopal minister; Summer a Civil Engineer and energetic
		  Superintendent of the North Carolina Railroad during the Civil War. Of the
		  third rank Buxton became a Judge, Shorter a prominent lawyer in Alabama, Whyte
		  a Surgeon in the Confederate Army and a Physician in Mississippi. Herring was a
		  lawyer and planter.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates of the class James Marshall McCorckle was a very
		  strong lawyer and leader in the General Assembly, a Reporter of the Supreme
		  Court; Waller R. Staples was a Presidential Elector, member of the Confederate
		  Congress, Commissioner to revise the laws of Virginia, and Judge of the Supreme
		  Court of that State; Henry Y. Webb, President of the Board of Censors and
		  Health Officer of Alabama.</p>
          <p>The Matriculates of this year, who lost their lives in the Civil War,
		  were Edward Mallett, Lieutenant-Colonel, and George T. Baskerville,
		  Captain.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>LAW DEPARTMENT.</head>
          <p>In 1845 the Professorship of Law was established under William H.
		  Battle, then Judge of the Superior Court, afterward Justice of the Supreme
		  Court, who had been for two years in charge of a private school. The full
		  course was that prescribed by the Supreme Court as necessary for license to
		  practice law. It comprised Blackstone's and Kent's Commentaries, Stephen and
		  Chitty on Pleading, Greenleaf's Evidence, Cruise's Digest of Real Property,
		  Williams on Executors, together with lectures <pb xml:id="p496" n="496"/>on the
		  Municipal Laws of the State, as modified by Acts of the Legislature and
		  decisions of the Courts.</p>
          <p>There were two classes. The Independent had no connection with the
		  College classes; the College class consisted of such undergraduates as the
		  Faculty allowed to join it. The normal time required of the Independents was
		  two years, and of the College class two and a half years. At the end of these
		  terms those deemed worthy received the degree of Bachelor of Law. The Professor
		  of Law received no salary from the University, but was entitled to charge
		  $100 per annum of the Independents and $50 of the others. He was
		  assisted by Samuel F. Phillips, a young lawyer of great promise.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on James Knox Polk,
		  President; on John Young Mason, Attorney General; and on Willie Person Mangum,
		  Senator of the United States. The honorary degree of Master of Arts was
		  conferred on John Randolph Clay, Secretary of Legation at Vienna, and Jeremiah
		  Wm. Murphy, of North Carolina.</p>
          <p>The Alumni Association met in the Library in Smith Hall on June 4th,
		  President J. M. Morehead in the Chair. There were twenty-five old members and
		  thirty-five accessions, making sixty present. The officers for the ensuing year
		  were ex-Governor Morehead, President, Governor Graham, C. L. Hinton, H.
		  Waddell, J. D. Hawkins, L. Polk and W. H. Haywood, Jr., Vice-Presidents; Wm. H.
		  Battle, W. M. Green, and J. DeB. Hooper, Executive Committee; C. Phillips,
		  Secretary, and A. G. Brown, Treasurer.</p>
          <p>The Association then adjourned to meet in Gerrard Hall at 3:30
		  o'clock. The Executive Committee reported their inability to procure an orator.
		  In lieu of an address sketches of the lives of ten of the Alumni, who had died
		  during the year, were read, viz. Of James Martin, by Charles Manly; Joel
		  Holleman, by George F. Davidson; Wm. S. Mhoon, by Wm H. Battle; Edward D. Sims,
		  by Wm. M. Green; Robert H. Cowan, by Thomas F. Davis; Green M. Cuthbert, by
		  Ralph H. Graves; John N. Barksdale, by Samuel F. Phillips; Thomas H. Spruill,
		  by Ashbel G. Brown; James W. Campbell, by Wm. J. Clarke; Ruffin W. Tomlinson,
		  by Wm. S. Mullins.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p497" n="497"/>
          <p>In addition to these ex-Governors Swain and Graham paid a tribute of
		  respect to the worth of William W. Cherry, an alumnus who did not graduate.</p>
          <p>The Secretary reported that it had been generally expected that the
		  body of Dr. Caldwell would at this time be removed to the monument in the
		  western part of the Campus, but President Swain stated that it was designed to
		  change the situation of the college graveyard and “establish, under the
		  auspices of the Association, a cemetery where the remains of eminent citizens
		  of the State might be deposited.” For this reason the expected ceremonies
		  were deferred.</p>
          <p>During this year there was considerable stir over the application for
		  employment of a Major Roberts as a teacher of athletics, including fencing and
		  boxing. He procured strong letters of recommendation from leading trustees, and
		  naturally won the favor of the student. It was shown, however, that he
		  advertised himself as having given at the University of Virginia instructions,
		  not only in fencing and boxing, but in the use of the bowie knife. Moreover, he
		  boasted of having been a London prize-fighter. The faculty refused to allow him
		  to form a class and he went his way.</p>

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1846.</head>
          <p>In 1846 the Freshman competitors in Declamation were Bryan Whitfield
		  of Alabama, Thomas M. Arrington of Nash, William H. Jones of Wake, Martin A.
		  Lyons of Alabama, William E. Hill of Duplin, Ridley Browne of Warren, and
		  Augustus S. Graves of Georgia.</p>
          <p>On the next night the Sophomore Declaimers spoke; Oliver P. Meares of
		  Wilmington, John K. Strange of Cumberland, Thomas E. Watson of Chapel Hill,
		  Seaton Gales of Raleigh, George Washington of Goldsboro, William A. Jenkins of
		  Warren, and Belfield W. Cave of Chapel Hill. Of the Freshmen Lyon, Browne and
		  Graves did not remain to graduation. Of the Sophomores all received their
		  degrees in 1848, except Watson.</p>
          <p>The Baccalaureate sermon was preached by Rev. Edward McCartney Forbes,
		  an alumnus of 1828, an Episcopal minister of <pb xml:id="p498" n="498"/>Eastern
		  North Carolina. Before the Historical Society at a public meeting Rev. Dr.
		  Fordyce M. Hubbard read a valuable paper on Sir Walter Raleigh. The annual
		  Orator before the two Societies was Bartholomew F. Moore, a graduate of 1820.
		  His theme was well and eloquently handled, “The Claims of the University
		  on Her Sons for Cultivating Truth and Universal Justice.”</p>
          <p>In our day we look on 1846 as only the beginning of great scientific
		  discoveries and inventions, yet we find Mr. Moore saying in his oration,
		  “The present age * * * to me is an age of Revolution. * * * While here
		  and there Astronomers have been opening the secret pages of celestial nature,
		  genius, under the guidance of science and art, with a thousand hands, and in
		  every civilized country on the globe, has been handling the elements of the
		  earth, and moulding them in every imaginable form for practical use and
		  application. * * * * Water, fire, air, steam and electricity, are all yoked in
		  the harness of art, and are creating, fetching, carrying, concentrating and
		  distributing as taste and want may direct, the treasures of mountain and plain,
		  of rivers and seas, of the poles and the equator. * * * Time overcome, and
		  leagues shortened to furlongs, and the press free to discuss the principles of
		  science and announce every discovery and invention, the knowledge of all men
		  becomes the knowledge of one. * * * The number and variety of inventions and
		  discoveries, the rapidity of their succession, and, above all, their successful
		  application to the pursuits of life, at first staggering mankind with fearful
		  apprehensions of a stupendous change, have by their use so suspended the
		  occupations of men, and rooted up the fixed habits of business, within my own
		  time, that I seem not only to have suffered a revolution, but to be in the
		  midst of a far greater one still.</p>
          <p>“As sensible, however, as I am made, of the immeasurable
		  benefits which have accrued and are still accruing to us from the wonderful
		  energies of mind, and as rapidly as I am whirled along in their dazzling march,
		  I yet see much that obstructs the moral advancement of our species, and
		  administers poison to the passions of the heart.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p499" n="499"/>
          <p>This language, it should be recollected, was used before the laying of
		  the first transatlantic cable, before the completion of a transcontinental
		  railroad and the great ocean liners and war ships, before the invention of the
		  telephone, phonograph, wireless telegraphy, sewing machine, automobile, before
		  the marvelous improvements in printing and agricultural and manufacturing
		  machinery.</p>
          <p>The first distinction was assigned to William Shepard Bryan, the
		  second to Richard Nathan Forbes, David Saunders Johnston, Sion Hart Rogers,
		  Frederick Augustus Shepard, and Owen Holmes Whitfield. The third to Turner
		  Westray Battle, James Riddle Ward and Richard Thomas Weaver. James Saunders
		  Amis was in the second rank, but was not named with the others because he was
		  not on regular standing at the University at the beginning of the Senior year,
		  and William Kennedy Blake, although of the same rank, was debarred from the
		  examination by severe sickness. Both were allowed honorary speeches at
		  Commencement. Alexander Franklin Brevard and Robert C. T. Sydenham Hilliard
		  were mentioned as next to the third honor men in scholarship.</p>
          <p>The Seniors spoke as follows:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, Frederick A. Shepard.</p>
          <p>“Howard, the Philanthropist,” Richard T. Weaver.</p>
          <p>“English Tragedy,” Daniel S. Johnston.</p>
          <p>“True Glory,” James S. Amis.</p>
          <p>“True National Greatness,” Sion H. Rogers.</p>
          <p>“Shades of the Past,” Turner W. Battle.</p>
          <p>“Reformation,” James R. Ward.</p>
          <p>“Influence of Fiction,” Richard N. Forbes.</p>
          <p>“Influence of Literature on Free Institutions,” Owen W.
		  Whitfield.</p>
          <p>“Highland Character,” Wm. K. Blake.</p>
          <p>The Valedictory, Wm. S. Bryan.</p>
          <p>In after life Bryan became a Judge of the Court of Appeals of
		  Maryland; Forbes a lawyer of great promise, but died early; Rogers,
		  Attorney-General of North Carolina, a Representative in Congress, and a Colonel
		  in the Confederate army; Shepard, a merchant and banker of high standing in
		  Nashville, Tennessee; Battle, a planter and Captain in the Confederate army;
		  <pb xml:id="p500" n="500"/>Ward and Weaver, trusted physicians; Blake, a Professor
		  in Female Colleges in Greensboro, Fayetteville and Spartanburg, South Carolina,
		  a lawyer, druggist and member of the South Carolina Legislature, a polished
		  orator, hindered from an eminent career by ill-health; Amis, an able lawyer and
		  member of the Legislature.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates, not graduating, Thomas Courtland Manning, LL.D.,
		  was a Brigadier-General C. S. A., Chief Justice of Louisiana and Minister to
		  Mexico; Josiah G. Turner, who dropped the G. from his name, lawyer, State
		  Senator and Representative, Captain, C. S. A., journalist, elected to Congress
		  in 1866, but not allowed to be seated; Owen Holmes Whitfield, Chancellor of
		  Mississippi.</p>
          <p>Joel C. Blake, Captain, and James Chalmers, Private, were the only
		  matriculates killed in the Civil War.</p>
          <p>The degree of Master of Arts was conferred on John Kimberly, a Teacher
		  in Hertford County, afterward a Professor in the University.</p>

          <p>Recognition was made of the efforts of ex-Governor Morehead, when in
		  office, to secure the elucidation of our State history.</p>
          <p>Of the Alumni Association there were thirty-six members present at the
		  meeting in Gerrard Hall June 3, 1846. On motion of ex-Governor Graham, all
		  Alumni who attended the meeting were enrolled as members.</p>
          <p>As a rule to choose the orator from the class which graduated thirty
		  years prior was adhered to, the Executive Committee had not succeeded in
		  procuring one for this occasion. Tributes to eight Alumni, who had died during
		  the last year, were submitted. Those of John Phifer, Rev. John Paisley, Richard
		  H. Claiborne and Edmund D. Covington were read by the Secretary; that of Hon.
		  John Giles by Judge Battle; that of Edward L. Lewis by Rev. Professor Green,
		  and that of Stephen Sneed Green by Mr. Samuel F. Phillips. Mr. John P. Sharpe
		  of Edgecombe died during the year, but his memorial did not arrive in time for
		  this meeting.</p>
          <p>The President of the Association, ex-Governor John Motly Morehead,
		  then delivered an address, a fit model for all to come afterward. It was in his
		  peculiarly felicitous style and aroused much enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>To the surprise of the Trustees a proposal was received from Rev. Dr.
		  Francis L. Hawks, the author of valuable historical works, Rector of Calvary
		  Church, New York, and eminent as an orator, expressing his willingness to
		  accept the Chair of History in the University. He was a native of this State,
		  born in Newbern, a graduate of this University, was a rising member of the bar,
		  being at one time Reporter of the Supreme Court decisions. Quitting the bar he
		  became an Episcopal minister, <pb xml:id="p502" n="502"/>distinguished as a
		  preacher. He was in 1846 engaged on his history of North Carolina, two volumes
		  of which, coming to 1729, were published in 1858. The Trustees declined to
		  establish the Chair, as suggested.</p>
          <p>There was some correspondence with Mr. S. Charles Ball to procure the
		  delivery of lectures embracing “the geological structure of the earth,
		  the origin of soils, the history of organic life, animal physiology, etc., and
		  so on to the food plants, the manufacture and application of manures and the
		  mechanical cultivation of the soil.” It does not appear why the project
		  was not carried into effect.</p>

          <head>DEATH OF MRS. CALDWELL.</head>
          <p>Dr. Caldwell's widow died October 30, 1846, while on a visit to
		  Professor DeBerniere Hooper at Chapel Hill. Her maiden name was Helen Hogg, she
		  being a daughter of James Hogg. I repeat some facts of her history. Her first
		  husband was Wm. Hooper, son of “the signer.” He died early, leaving
		  two sons, William and Thomas Clark, and when the elder was prepared for the
		  University she moved to Chapel Hill in order to have them with her. Dr.
		  Caldwell had married Susan Rowan, daughter of Robert Rowan of Fayetteville who,
		  with her infant daughter, died soon, leaving him a widower and childless.
		  Before many years elapsed the fascinating young widow Hooper became the
		  President's wife, and she adorned the station by the graciousness of her
		  manners, the activity of her benevolence and leadership in good works. Her
		  elder son, Rev. William Hooper, D.D., became eminent as is told elsewhere.
		  Thomas was a lawyer, died early. After the President's death she moved back to
		  Hillsboro, where were many relatives.</p>
          <p>The following letter from the accomplished authoress, Mrs. Caroline
		  Lee Hentz, well expresses the impression Mrs. Caldwell made on all who knew
		  her:</p>

                  <p>I always recur with pleasure to our residence at Chapel Hill. There was so much kindness, warm feeling, hospitality, union, and we all loved Mrs. Caldwell so much, and relied so entirely on her sincerity. I have often thought since I have been here<pb xml:id="p503" n="503"/>
that I would give all the world if I had another Mrs. Caldwell living just as near. I should now love her better than ever, for my own beloved mother, for whom I was then yearning, is now dead, and there is no one like her left behind.</p>
                  <p>The following notice, kindly copied for me by Miss Alice C. Heartt from the Hillsboro <hi rend="italics">Recorder,</hi>of which her father, Mr. Dennis Heartt, was for many years editor and owner, is a truthful estimate of Mrs. Caldwell's character.</p>

                  <p>Died at Chapel Hill on Friday morning, the 30th ultimo, in the 78th year of her age, Mrs. Helen Caldwell, relict of the Rev. Joseph Caldwell, late President of the University of North Carolina. The deceased was a woman of extraordinary endowments, blending in her character the highest mental culture with all the Christian graces in their liveliest exercise. She has left few superiors; and those who enjoyed her acquaintance will feel that, by her removal, a space has been left in society which will not soon be filled. But with what confidence can her friends and relatives commit her to the tomb! She was a bright and shining light in the church, and it was impossible to be in her company without admiring the Christian cheerfulness which she at all times exhibited.”</p>
                  <p>“The funeral obsequies were performed at Chapel Hill on Sunday last, the President and Faculty of the University acting as pall-bearers on the occasion. The sermon was delivered by the Rev. Dr. Mitchell from Phil. 4:3. ‘Endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace,’ and her remains were deposited with those of her late husband at the base of the monument erected to his memory by the Trustees of the University.”</p>

          <p>Her son, Dr. William Hooper, on his death-bed requested that his body
		  be placed by that of his mother, which was done August 19, 1876. In July, 1894,
		  the remains of the three were reverently re-interred by the east side of the
		  Caldwell monument, the wife being between her husband and her son.</p>
          <p>It was at this Commencement that a dangerous panic occurred in the
		  Chapel which created much fright, but no damage to anyone. The galleries were
		  supported by very slender pillars, widely separated. While the exercises were
		  in progress, every seat taken and many spectators standing, some one, alarmed
		  perhaps by the breaking of a stick, shouted “The gallery is
		  falling!” There was a general rush for the doors, and some
		  <pb xml:id="p504" n="504"/>young men had the pleasure of showing their gallantry by
		  catching young ladies as they jumped from the windows. There was real danger to
		  those in the galleries as the staircases were narrow and winding. Returning
		  sense soon discerned the fact that the danger was imaginary. Some attempted to
		  jump from the upper windows, but were held back.</p>
          <p>The coolness of President Swain, Governor Graham, and other Trustees,
		  contributed to pacifying the excited crowd and after an interval the exercises
		  were resumed. Before the next Commencement additional pillars were placed, and
		  a competent architect pronounced the galleries perfectly safe.</p>

          <head>PRESIDENT POLK'S COMMENCEMENT.</head>
          <p>The Commencement of 1847 was the most interesting and conspicuous in
		  our history up to that time. The President of the United States accepted the
		  urgent invitation of President Swain and revisited his Alma Mater after an
		  absence of twenty-nine years. He was accompanied by his Secretary of the Navy,
		  John Young Mason, a Senior, when his chief was a Sophomore. With him, too, was
		  Lieutenant Matthew P. Maury, then in the beginning of his great career in the
		  study of the air and ocean. His classmate, Thomas J. Green, of Virginia,
		  generally regarded at the University as the greater genius by nature, also
		  accompanied him, as did also Branch, once Secretary of the Navy and Governor of
		  this State and of Florida, and Wm. A. Graham, Governor of North Carolina,
		  ex-Governor Morehead, and other prominent men. A classmate, Professor Green,
		  was on hand to welcome his old associate. The chronicler averred that no other
		  institution ever had a President and member of his cabinet and Governor of a
		  distant State in attendance on its exercises.</p>
          <p>The occasion was likewise memorable because the Senior Class contained
		  many strong men, but <choice><sic>especally</sic><corr>especially</corr></choice>two uncommonly
		  conspicuous, and destined to eminent careers. These were James Johnston
		  Pettigrew, whose brilliancy of scholarship has never been excelled, if
		  equalled, at this institution, and Matt Whitaker Ransom, a close second to
		  Pettigrew in scholarship, and superior to all in oratory.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p505" n="505"/>
          <p>Numerous visitors overflowed the little village, and while the
		  hospitality of the Professors and the other whole-souled citizens was stretched
		  to the utmost, the popular hostess of the hotel, Miss Nancy Hilliard, erected a
		  special addition to her building for the accommodation of the chief officer of
		  the Republic.</p>
          <p>The President and his suite arrived at five o'clock on Monday, in
		  carriages from Raleigh. The Faculty and students in double line received them
		  at the hotel. After allowing a short while for brushing off the dust of the
		  journey, the visitors were conducted to Gerrard Hall, where they were received
		  with enthusiasm, such as students know how to accord. The speech of President
		  Swain was “distinguished by eminent courtesy of sentiment and chasteness
		  of diction.” The answer of the President was most felicitous. His tribute
		  to President Caldwell was extremely touching. Secretary Mason was as usual most
		  happy in his answer to the cordial welcome extended.</p>
          <p>On Monday night there was the Valedictory sermon, now called the
		  Baccalaureate, by Bishop Levi Silliman Ives, then in the zenith of his fame as
		  a pulpit orator.</p>
          <p>Tuesday was occupied by the examination of the Seniors in
		  Constitutional and International Law in presence of the distinguished visitors,
		  and in Astronomy for the special honor of the Superintendent of the National
		  Observatory, Captain, (afterward Commodore), Maury. He was so struck by the
		  brilliancy of our mathematical champion, Pettigrew, that he offered him a
		  situation in the Observatory, which was accepted.</p>
          <p>The number of competitors in Declamation was reduced to four in each
		  class and their exercise was on Tuesday night. Those from the Freshman class
		  were William Henry Johnston, Joel C. Blake, Richard Hines and Samuel E.
		  Whitfield. The Sophs were Charles R. Thomas, William H. Jones, Thomas J.
		  Robinson and Augustus S. Graves. All became graduates except the last, who
		  settled as a farmer in Texas.</p>
          <p>The Address before the two Societies was by choice of the Dialectic
		  Society, James W. Osborne of the Class of 1830. He had been very prominent in
		  the Legislature, on the hustings and at the bar and was afterward a Judge of
		  the Superior Court. <pb xml:id="p506" n="506"/>Expectation ran high, somewhat
		  dampened, however, when it was learned that he wrote much of his address after
		  he reached Chapel Hill. Being so fresh from his manuscript his delivery was
		  tame. His subject was, “Causes tending to retard literary taste and
		  excellence in the United States.” The contemporary chronicler, however,
		  pronounced the effort “one of the most chaste and eloquent addresses he
		  had ever listened to. Especially great was his tribute to Judge Gaston, who
		  died three years before.” “No literary flounces decorated the
		  skeleton of thought, but there was throughout the rich embroidery, which can be
		  found only in the storehouse of a well cultivated mind.”</p>
          <p>The pupils of Dr. Caldwell beheld with sorrow the unseemly condition
		  of the old sandstone monument which was the only outward evidence of the
		  reverence felt by the Alumni to his memory. On motion of John Y. Mason,
		  advocated by President Polk, it was resolved that the Alumni, by small
		  contributions of three dollars each, erect a marble memorial of his virtues in
		  a central part of the Campus. Two hundred and ten dollars was raised at once,
		  showing the presence of seventy Alumni. It became afterward necessary to remove
		  the limit.</p>
          <p>The Alumni Address was by John Y. Mason, of the class of 1816, on
		  Wednesday night. He was accompanied on the stage by Hon. John H. Bryan, of that
		  of 1815, and Professor W. M. Green, of 1818. The address, in manner and matter,
		  was uncommonly successful. The speaker had a well-modulated silvery voice. The
		  chronicler expressed the views of the audience when he said that “trope
		  and simile flashed in quick succession, electrifying at times the dullest
		  intellect. The subject was, “The substantial advances and glories of this
		  country—the mysterious links by which a general education, an omnipotent
		  free Press, a common object and a Religion, under different manifestations, one
		  and the same, bound together the destinies of a mighty people, the benefactors
		  of this generation and the last hope of the world.”</p>
          <p>The deaths of five Alumni, William F. Brown, William H. Bell, Lawrence
		  W. Scott, John A. Graves, and Dr. John Hill were reported. The obituaries of
		  Messrs. Brown, Bell and Hill were prepared, but could not be read for want of
		  time.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p507" n="507"/>
          <p>The first honor in the class of 36 members was awarded to James
		  Johnston Pettigrew and Matt Whitaker Ransom “in the order of their
		  names,” the former allowed the Valedictory because of being a shade
		  better than the latter. In Mathematics, Pettigrew's mark was
		  “excellent,” while Ransom's was “very good.” In other
		  respects they were equal.</p>
          <p>The second distinction went to Alfred Alston, Jr., John C. Coleman,
		  Samuel J. Erwin, Wm. M. Howerton, John Pool, and Robert H. Winborne; the third
		  distinction to Joel D. Battle, John A. Guion, Lionel L. Levy, Wm. Lucas, W. H.
		  Manly and John J. Kindred.</p>
          <p>The subsequent careers of the honor men were mostly continuations on a
		  grander scale of their University successes. Pettigrew, after a short service
		  in the Nautical Almanac office, embraced the profession of the law. He settled
		  in Charleston and during a term in the South Carolina Legislature distinguished
		  himself by a very able minority report opposing the revival of the Slave Trade.
		  Foreseeing the Civil War he studied the science of war and when the disastrous
		  struggle came he rose rapidly until, with the rank of Brigadier General, he was
		  placed in command of Heth's Division and led it in the far-famed assault on
		  Cemetery Hill at Gettysburg. He was killed during the retreat into Virginia.
		  His old superior officer, Commodore Maury was so impressed by his genius as to
		  declare that he was well fitted to take General Lee's place if it should
		  unfortunately be vacated. Ransom's long term in the United States Senate after
		  being Attorney General, and high reputation as Brigadier General in the
		  Confederate Army are well known, as is his fame as an orator.</p>
          <p>Ransom was the only member of the class who attended punctually the
		  required nearly 5,000 exercises, Prayers, Church and Recitations. Because of
		  his special powers of oratory a Salutatory in English was created for him and
		  he won much distinction by his effort. The Salutatory in Latin came next, by
		  Samuel J. Erwin. Then followed:</p>

          <p>Among those with the Class not graduating was Edmund Burke Haywood,

		  the State Medical Society, President of the Raleigh Academy of Medicine and of
		  the Board of Directors of the State Insane Asylum, Chairman of the State Board
		  of Public Charities; also Jonathan Osborne, a Judge in Louisiana, a native of
		  Oxford.</p>
          <p>The matriculates during the year 1847, who gave their lives for the
		  Southern cause were: George B. Anderson, Brigadier General; Isaac E. Avery,

          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on Benjamin Peirce, of
		  Harvard University, and of Master of Arts on Matthew Fontaine Maury, of the
		  National Observatory.</p>
          <p>It is evidence of the extreme carefulness with which was guarded the
		  granting of degrees, that even Maury, of worldwide fame, for his work on Winds
		  and Currents, was not deemed worthy of the Doctorate of Laws.</p>
          <p>The procession on Thursday, Commencement Day, was the largest ever
		  seen, but was well conducted by the efficient corps of marshals, Thomas J.
		  Person, Chief, and his “Subs,” John B. Bynum, John W. Cameron,
		  Lorenzo D. Pender and John K. Strange. Their watchful efficiency met with
		  universal praise.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p509" n="509"/>
          <p>The public agreed that all things passed off well and the University
		  had acquired more than ever a National standing President Polk was applauded
		  for his total absence of ostentation, his sincere and unassuming courtesy. The
		  contrast of the thoughtful, tranquil expression of his classmate, Thomas J.
		  Green, of Virginia, looking twenty years younger, with the President's anxious
		  countenance, his silvered hair and careworn features, denoting incessant toil
		  and perhaps suffering, was observed. Green, his equal in talents, had chosen a
		  private life. Judge Mason was considered a fair example of a Virginian in the
		  best days of the Old Dominion, of frank, generous temper, always willing to be
		  pleased. Lieutenant Maury, high in the world of science, able and studious, won
		  all hearts by his sunny temper and genial manners. It was said of him that in
		  the seclusion of the closet he had not lost the characteristics of the sailor.
		  The President's Lady, as his wife was called, was pronounced by all classes to
		  be peculiarly fascinating.</p>
          <p>The President's party remained until the conclusion of the exercises
		  on Thursday and, greatly to the regret of the Ball managers, journeyed to
		  Moring's eight miles, and thence next morning took the train to Raleigh. With
		  the party was a correspondent of the New York Herald, the first reporter of our
		  Commencements to a Northern newspaper. He was fair and, as a rule,
		  complimentary.</p>
          <p>The chronic grumbler praised the music, but felt outraged because it
		  was by Signor George's band, of Richmond, Va., instead of one vastly inferior
		  from our own State. He made no converts to this heresy.</p>
          <p>The Ball was as usual brilliant and well managed, cotillons and reels
		  being more prominent than the waltz and polka. The pleasure was marred by the
		  bad floor, low ceiling and dingy walls of the Hotel dining room, the only
		  available room in the village, and the dancers complained of the absence of
		  violin strains from the music.</p>

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1848.</head>
          <p>The Commencement of 1848 showed a distinct reaction from the greatness
		  of that of the preceding year. It was noted with sharp censure that there were
		  only six or seven Trustees <pb xml:id="p510" n="510"/>present. On Monday there was
		  an examination of the Senior Class in Chemistry in presence of Messrs. Nicholas
		  L. Williams and Wm. Eaton, Jr.</p>
          <p>The Freshman Competitors in Delcamation were John McK. Henson, Joseph
		  B. Bryan, Claudius B. Sanders, Malcolm J. McDuffie, Charles C. Terry, Rufus L.
		  Patterson, Samuel B. Morisey, Neill McKay, Jr., and David M. Carter. The
		  Sophomores were Joel C. Blake, Alexander R. Strange, John Manning, Washington
		  C. Kerr, Richard Hines, Jr., Henry Hardie, Samuel E. Whitfield and Benjamin R.
		  Huske. All were graduated except Henson, Morrisey and Strange.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday Hon. William Eaton, Jr., of the class of 1829, then in
		  the height of his reputation on account of the publication of his excellent
		  book of Legal Forms, delivered the annual Address. His theme was the
		  “Future Literary Prospects of America.” The reporter voiced the
		  sentiments of the audience in saying that his ability as a writer was only
		  exceeded by his modesty as a man.</p>
          <p>A very able eulogy on John Quincy Adams, who died on the 23rd of the
		  preceding February, was then pronounced at the request of the Historical
		  Society by Hon. Samuel Field Phillips of the Class of 1841.</p>
          <p>At night the sermon before the Graduating class was preached by an
		  eminent Presbyterian divine and teacher, Rev. John A. Gretter, D.D. It was full
		  of wise thought, clothed in devout and chaste language and delivered in a most
		  reverend and earnest style.</p>
          <p>The Alumni Association held their business meeting in the Library on
		  May 31st, 1846, Governor Graham, Vice-President, in the Chair. The Committee
		  for collecting funds for a new monument to Dr. Caldwell reported progress and
		  were instructed, in conjunction with the Executive Committee, to decide on a
		  suitable plan and to call on the Alumni for the necessary funds.</p>
          <p>In order to provide for contingent expenses each of the Alumni was
		  required to pay one dollar, unless he had already paid the same.</p>
          <p>At the public meeting in Gerrard Hall obituaries of the
		  <pb xml:id="p511" n="511"/>Alumni who had died during the past year were read as
		  follows:</p>
          <p>That of Hinton James, the first student, by Governor Graham; Thomas D.
		  Bennehan, by President Swain; John B. Brown, by Prof. W. M. Green; Wm. P.
		  Ferrand, by Wm. Eaton, Jr.; Dr. James B. Slade, by Rufus Barringer; Rev. Philip
		  W. Alston, by Prof W. M. Green; Captain Exum L. Whitaker, by James Johnston;
		  Peter G. Burton, by Owen H. Whitfield; Wm. Henry Manly, by Menalcas
		  Lankford.</p>
          <p>The obituary of Dr. John Hill, prepared for the meeting in 1857, was
		  read by the Secretary, Charles Phillips. President Swain paid a feeling tribute
		  to the memory of Dr. James A. Washington and promised an extended notice for
		  the next meeting.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>NEW SOCIETY HALLS.</head>
          <p>As long ago as 1837 Gaston H. Wilder, James M. Burke and Dennis D.
		  Ferebee were appointed a Committee on behalf of the Philanthropic Society to
		  petition the Trustees for a new Hall. This was followed the next year by a
		  similar petition on behalf of the Dialectic Society. A new building was
		  estimated to cost $5,000. The Society agreed to subscribe liberally and
		  the members on their own account promised subscriptions. It was urged that the
		  exercises were seriously injured by the small size of the debating halls and
		  the increase of the library was prevented by want of shelf room. The Committee
		  of the latter body were Tod. R. Caldwell, Isham W. Garrott and William
		  Johnston. The Trustees referred the petition to Messrs. D. L. Swain, Andrew
		  Joyner and W. A. Graham, who reported in January, 1839, that the societies had
		  accumulated libraries, aggregating about seven thousand volumes, which were in
		  the shingle-covered South building, having in the winter season over
		  twenty-five fires constantly burning. The erection of one or two new buildings
		  would enable the Trustees to have six dormitories, out of the vacated halls,
		  and at least four more could be had in the new building. The present
		  dormitories accommodated one hundred and thirty students, whereas there were
		  one hundred and sixty-five, one-fifth of whom reside in the village. Another
		  consideration was that the existing Philanthropic <pb xml:id="p512" n="512"/>rooms
		  were smaller than those of the Dialectic, whereas there should be perfect
		  equality. The Special Committee therefore recommended that the Executive
		  Committee, after the payment of the debt to the Banks, as soon as the State of
		  the funds would admit, join the Societies in the erection of two fireproof
		  halls of the same dimensions and external plan, or one building of suitable
		  proportions, the University to pay at least two-thirds of the cost. The Board
		  concurred in the report.</p>
          <p>Probably because of suits for Tennessee lands, the title of which the
		  University had warranted, which as a rule, however, after considerable delay,
		  were decided in its favor, nothing was done under the resolution for several
		  years. In 1843 President Swain was instructed to correspond with Mr. Robert
		  Donaldson, of New York, “on the best mode of procuring plans for the
		  Society Halls, and of obtaining the services of an individual skilled in laying
		  out pleasure grounds, landscape gardening, etc.” Under these instructions
		  Mr. A. J. Davis, an architect of New York, was employed.</p>
          <p>In the next year the plans and specifications for the enlargement of
		  the East and West buildings for the accomodation of the two Societies with
		  Halls and Libraries were submitted and approved. The Societies asked that the
		  Trustees should credit their one-third subscription with fourteen hundred
		  dollars for each society, that is, allowing one hundred dollars for every
		  dormitory room added by the improvement. The East and West buildings were to be
		  extended toward the North, one-half their former length, the halls for the
		  meetings to be in the second story of the extension and the Libraries divided
		  into alcoves in the third. The charges of the architect seem very moderate,
		  namely one hundred dollars, besides expenses of his trip to and from New York,
		  and an additional hundred on completion of the work. The improvements were
		  finished four years later. The narrative of the ceremonies attending the
		  removal of the Societies into the new quarters will be hereafter given. The
		  Societies eventually were released from their promise to pay one-third of the
		  cost.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p513" n="513"/>
          <p>In 1846 the Trustees concluded to grant by lot the East building and
		  the Eastern half of the South to the members of one Society, and the West
		  building and the Western half of the South to those of the other. After the
		  allotment the East and West buildings were to have the names of the Society of
		  the occupants. Wm. M. Howerton, the Dialectic President, and Matt. W. Ransom,
		  the Philanthropic President, were to cast the lots in behalf of their
		  respective Societies in presence of Governor Graham, President Swain and
		  Secretary Manly. The Philanthropic Society won the Eastern division and of
		  course the Dialectic the Western. The plan was, however, so modified by
		  agreement in regard to the South building, that all the rooms looking North
		  were given to the Philanthropic and all looking South to the other. The
		  arrangement lasted until the closing of the doors in 1868, and was acceptable,
		  because it was considered desirable to have the members on the same side as
		  were their Halls and Libraries. The rooms to the North have the advantage of
		  the outlook on the Campus; those to the South are much cooler in the summer, a
		  matter of moment when the exercises began in July.</p>
          <p>The extensions planned by Davis of the Old East and the Old West were
		  executed under the supervision of President Swain and Judge Battle, by Isaac J.
		  Collier and Kendall B. Waitt, the contract price being $9,360, and were
		  finished in 1848. Mr. Samuel F. Phillips, of the class of 1841, superintended
		  the removal of the books into the Dialectic alcoves. He adopted the plan of
		  arranging by subjects. The books of the Philanthropic Society were rearranged
		  by Mr. Joseph F. Cannon, a law student, who adopted a somewhat similar plan,
		  deviating from it where economy of space required.</p>
          <p>The inauguration of the Societies into their new debating halls was
		  attended with interesting proceedings. In the Dialectic Hall the first
		  President of the Society, in 1795, James Mebane, was present, having come from
		  his home near Milton. Rev. Professor William M. Green offered up a prayer. Then
		  Mr. Mebane, who had been speaker of the House of Commons and a very influential
		  citizen, by request took a seat by the side <pb xml:id="p514" n="514"/>of the
		  President, Kemp. P. Battle. In complying he delivered a neat and appropriate
		  address, giving reminiscenses of the past and sound advice to the students. He
		  was followed by Mr. Samuel Field Phillips, with a most masterly history of the
		  Society, which has unfortunately been lost. The Society afterward asked the
		  privilege of having painted, by Wm. Garl Brown, an oil painting of the First
		  President. It is a perfect likeness as he appeared, when <hi rend="italics">causa honoris</hi>presiding, fifty-three years after he was the
		  first executive officer of the Society.</p>
          <p>The orator of the Philanthropic Society was Tutor Ashbel Green Brown,
		  a graduate of 1843, a man of fine talents and attainments. The Secretary of the
		  Society informs me that no additional ceremonies were had.</p>
          <p>It is perhaps needless to say that the resolution to change the names
		  of the Old East and Old West buildings to the Philanthropic and Dialectic
		  buildings was never carried into effect. There are associations connected with
		  the old names too precious to be lost.</p>
          <p>The following shows the names and subjects of the Graduating Class,
		  Wilson drawing the Valedictory, leaving the Latin to Gales, who exchanged with
		  Baskerville. Barringer, Gales and Jenkins won most plaudits:</p>
          <p>Salutatory Oration (in Latin), George T. Baskerville.</p>

          <pb xml:id="p515" n="515"/>
          <p>The first distinction was awarded to Seaton Gales and John Wilson.</p>
          <p>The second to George T. Baskervllle, John W. Cameron, Thomas H.
		  Holmes, William A. Jenkins, Willie P. Mangum and James N. Montgomery.</p>
          <p>The third to Victor C. Barringer, Oliver H. Dockery, Peter H.
		  McEachin, Thomas J. Person and Robert W. Wilson.</p>
          <p>No member of the class was entirely punctual. The class, with three or
		  four exceptions, was commended for punctuality, fidelity and courtesy in the
		  recitation room, but a similar compliment could not be recorded for punctuality
		  at Prayers. The worst offender had 370 absences, the next 339, then 286 and
		  276, out of 520 attendances required for four years.</p>
          <p>Following the honor men in after life we find Gales editor of the
		  Raleigh Register, Adjutant of a Brigade in the Confederate Army, celebrated in
		  the State as a lecturer. Wilson was a physician of repute.</p>
          <p>Of the rest, Jenkins was a very able Attorney General of the State and
		  a Confederate Lieutenant Colonel; Mangum, Consul and Consul General for China
		  and Japan.

          <p>In 1848 Rev. Charles F. Deems resigned the Adjunct Professorship of
		  Rhetoric and Logic and the Chair was not filled. I give a short sketch of this
		  eminent and most useful divine.</p>
          <p>Charles Force Deems, D.D., LL.D., was born in Baltimore, December 4,
		  1820, and died in New York, November 18, 1893. He was trained at Dickinson
		  College and, before he was twenty-one, began preaching at Asbury, N. J. In 1840
		  he came to North Carolina as Agent of the Bible Society. Two years afterward he
		  was made Adjunct Professor of Rhetoric and Logic in the State University, an
		  office created especially for him. In addition to the work of this Department
		  he had classes in Latin and the Bible. After leaving the University in 1848 he
		  was for a year Professor of Natural Sciences in Randolph-Macon College. He then
		  had a pastoral charge at Newbern, and was elected Delegate to the General
		  Conference. Then he successively had pastoral charges and was Presiding Elder
		  of the Wilmington and Newbern Districts. After a tour of Europe and the Holy
		  Land he declined the Professorship of History in our University. He was the
		  founder of a school of high rank in Wilson and during the war was active in
		  raising funds for an orphanage for the children of Confederate soldiers, a
		  laudable purpose defeated by the calamities of the war. After the sun of the
		  Confederacy went down he projected a newspaper, the Watchman, designed to aid
		  in bringing the hearts of the two sections together. He changed his residence
		  to New York, where it was published, but was obliged, for want of support, to
		  discontinue it. Nothing daunted he began to administer to the religious needs
		  of the numerous strangers in the city, and such was his enthusiasm and
		  eloquence that he built up a flourishing Church, which he appropriately called
		  the Church of the Strangers. In a few years he had organized the American
		  Institute of Christian Philosophy, and was editor of its magazine, Christian
		  Thought.</p>
          <p>Besides his arduous labors as a preacher Dr. Deems found time for much
		  literary work. For five years he was editor of the Southern Methodist Episcopal
		  Pulpit; for ten years of the Annals of Southern Methodism; for some years of
		  Leslie's Sunday Magazine, and of Christian Thought. He was author of the
		  following books: Triumph of Peace, and Other Poems; <pb xml:id="p517" n="517"/>Life
		  of Adam Clarke; Devotional Melodies; Twelve College Sermons; Home Altar; What
		  Now? Forty Sermons in the Church of the Strangers; Jesus (or Life of Christ);
		  Light of All Nations; Weights and Wings; Sermons, 1855; A Scotch Verdict
		  <hi rend="italics">in re</hi>Evolution; Gospel of Common Sense; Gospel of
		  Spiritual Insight; Chips and Chunks; My Septuagint.</p>
          <p>His Doctorate of Divinity was conferred by Randolph-Macon College;
		  that of Doctor of Laws by the University of North Carolina.</p>
          <p>The Deems Fund, to be loaned on security to needy students, now about
		  $20,000, has been of signal benefit to worthy and aspiring young men
		  being trained at our University. It was established by Dr. Deems in memory of
		  his son Theodore Disosway Deems, a Confederate Lieutenant, who was killed in
		  the famous charge at Gettysburg. His friend, William H. Vanderbilt, largely
		  added to it for his sake.</p>
          <p>In the same year Professor John DeBerniere Hooper resigned his
		  Professorship of Latin. It was understood that he thought that the methods of
		  discipline, handed down from Dr. Caldwell's day, caused a feeling of hostility
		  of students against the Faculty and led to secret mischief and immorality. He
		  had been one of the most faithful and able teachers and the loftiness of his
		  character was conspicuous. In exchanging a congenial position for the uncertain
		  and unpleasant task of managing a miscellaneous school, while he had a wife and
		  three children to support, he showed the spirit of a martyr.</p>
          <p>Professor Hooper, after leaving the University, opened a classical
		  academy in Warren County, near Littleton. He was assisted by his father-in-law,
		  Rev. Dr. Wm. Hooper. Thence he removed to Fayetteville and conducted a similar
		  school. Afterward we find him in charge of a flourishing female seminary in
		  Wilson, from which he was elected in 1875 to be again a Professor in the
		  University. He died at Chapel Hill, January 27, 1886.</p>
          <p>Those nominated for Professor Hooper's chair were Benjamin Summer, of
		  the class of 1822, who had been a member of the General Assembly; Rev. Moses A.
		  Curtis, an Episcopal <choice><sic>ministerof</sic><corr>minister of</corr></choice>great learning,
		  especially in Botany; Jefferson M. <pb xml:id="p518" n="518"/>Lovejoy, a native of
		  Vermont, Principal of the Raleigh Male Academy; Rev. Fordyce M. Hubbard, a
		  gifted classical scholar. All were, or had been, Principals of classical
		  schools.</p>
          <p>Rev. Fordyce M. Hubbard was an Episcopal clergyman, born in
		  Connecticut, and an alumnus of Williams College in Massachusetts. He was for
		  some time a Rector of Christ Church, Newbern, and then became Principal of
		  Trinity High School in Wake County. Thence he was elected to the Professorship
		  of Latin in the University, and entered on his duties the following year.</p>
          <p>He had a well deserved reputation for extensive acquaintance with the
		  Classics and English Literature. He had a keen eye for discerning their force
		  and beauty. He published no book, but his fugitive writings on biographical and
		  other subjects were models of elegance of style and propriety of diction. His
		  teaching was quiet and scholarly. If a pupil showed flippancy or pertness he
		  met it with an aptness of sarcasm, which crushed the tendency, but left no
		  sting. He was made Doctor of Divinity by Williams College.</p>
          <p>It was with great reluctance that the Professors and Trustees of the
		  old school gave up even in part compulsory worship in the Chapel on Sundays.
		  Professor Green, after the Episcopal Church was finished in 1848, moved for the
		  privilege of members of that denomination to attend worship in their Church. He
		  was fought vehemently and sometimes with scant courtesy, but, although in
		  non-essentials mild in manner, in matters of conscience he was firm as a rock.
		  He ultimately triumphed, but not until he became Bishop of Mississippi, and not
		  completely until after Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist Church edifices in
		  the village were erected.</p>
          <p>The Chapel services were held at eleven o'clock in the morning, the
		  roll being called after the second bell. Dr. Mitchell as a rule officiated one
		  Sunday and Professor Green the next. The latter omitted the Ante-Communion
		  service, and the Litany. There was no heating of the Chapel in the winter and
		  in cold weather there was sad shivering in overcoats and cloaks. As a rule
		  self-respect caused the students to don their best clothes, because ladies were
		  present, and did not appear in shirt and <pb xml:id="p519" n="519"/>drawers,
		  covered by a bed quilt as was often the case at Morning Prayers. The service
		  lasted about one hour and a half. Although Dr. Mitchell disapproved of forms,
		  his long prayer was always the same. We all knew its successive stages and
		  could accurately estimate how many minutes there were to the longed for end.
		  The music was led by Tutor Charles Phillips, armed with tuning fork, but few of
		  the students could be induced to join him. No discouragements, however, could
		  daunt his persevering pluck. Once at the funeral of his oldest child Dr.
		  Mitchell said, “It is painful for me to call on a parent of the deceased
		  to raise the tune, but there is no other course to pursue.” Right
		  manfully did Mr. Phillips respond, by painful effort subordinating private
		  grief to religious duty. The sermons were not adapted to the young, orthodox
		  thoroughly, but solemn truisms, not animated sufficiently to awaken a
		  slumbering youth or keep him awake after attention had been secured. I must not
		  be understood as censuring the eminent preachers. Their style was the fashion
		  of the age. Young Dr. Deems, who <choice><sic>accasionally</sic><corr>occasionally</corr></choice>
		  occupied the pulpit, was the pioneer of discoursing on live subjects. His
		  little book, Twelve College Sermons, has brightness as well as truth.</p>
          <p>The Presbyterian Church was built by the energy particularly of Tutor
		  Phillips, who, in addition to the large subscriptions of himself and his
		  father, procured aid from members of the denomination all over the State. The
		  list of names with amounts paid embraces nearly all of the influential
		  Presbyterians of North Carolina about the middle of the century.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>COMPULSORY CHAPEL WORSHIP.</head>
          <p>The efforts of Professor Green to procure liberty to students to
		  worship at the Church of their choice met, for some years, with little
		  success.</p>
          <p>There was excitement on the subject in distant quarters. On December
		  11, 1849, at a meeting of the Trustees it is recorded “that sundry
		  petitions from different parts of the State and different Christian
		  denominations on the subject of the modification of the ordinance relating to
		  public worship in the College Chapel on the Sabbath was laid before the
		  Board.” Ex-Governor <pb xml:id="p520" n="520"/>James Iredell offered an
		  ordinance that attendance at some Church should be obligatory, but that
		  students of full age might choose their places of worship, and parents and
		  guardians might choose for their sons and wards under age. This was referred to
		  a Committee, viz: Walter F. Leak, B. F. Moore and Calvin Graves.</p>
          <p>Mr. Leak, for the Committee, submitted a substitute, embracing the
		  Iredell ordinance, with the addition that the places of worship should be
		  selected within ten days after the admission of the student, and could not be
		  changed during the session, except to the Chapel service.</p>
          <p>The Board adjourned to January 4, 1850, when the Leak ordinance was
		  voted down. There was so much feeling that the ayes and noes were called. Wm.
		  B. Shepard, Wm. H. Washington, Wm. Julius Alexander, Robert B. Gilliam, James
		  Iredell, John H. Bryan, are recorded in the affirmative, and Charles Manly,
		  Daniel W. Courts, George P. Davidson, James C. Dobbin, John A. Gilmer, William
		  A. Graham, Charles L. Hinton, Giles Mebane, Frederick Nash, Samuel F.
		  Patterson, David L. Swain, Hugh Waddell and Nicholas L. Williams in the
		  negative. General Samuel F. Patterson then offered a substitute, which was
		  unanimously adopted, that communicants within ten days after entrance, on
		  notifying the Faculty of their wishes, could attend the church of their choice,
		  but could not change during the session. The Faculty should require regular
		  attendance by all somewhere as a University duty. Here the matter rested for
		  ten years, communicants only being excused from Chapel worship. There are some
		  names recorded in the negative, whose sentiments in favor of liberality are so
		  well known that it is clear their votes were given in deference to President
		  Swain. His vote was, it is suspected, determined more by considerations of
		  discipline than of religion.</p>

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1849.</head>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1849 the large audience was arranged, said the
		  reporter, to produce a beautiful and artistic effect. The assemblage of ladies
		  was especially brilliant. The explanation of this improvement is that the
		  ladies were all <pb xml:id="p521" n="521"/>seated together, experience having
		  proved that the sexes, when within talking distance, will effervesce in
		  unseemly chatter. The change was very beneficial to order.</p>
          <p>The Baccalaureate sermon was preached by Rev. Dr. Charles Force Deems,
		  and fully sustained his reputation as a pulpit orator.</p>
          <p>The Declaimers from the Sophomore class were Bartholomew Fuller,
		  Malcolm J. McDuffie, Neill McKay, Thomas J. Norcom, Rufus L. Patterson, James
		  A. Patton, Claudius B. Sanders, Francis E. Shober and Charles C. Terry. For the
		  Freshman class were Wm. D. Barnes, Thomas B. Burton, Wm. M. Carrigan, Thomas H.
		  Gilliam, Benjamin A. Kittrell, Joseph A. Manning, Wm. A. Moore, James J. Slade,
		  Basil M. Thompson, and Legh R. Waddell. All became graduates except Kittrell
		  and Moore. Of these, Kittrell was a lawyer and politician of promise but died
		  early. Moore became a Judge and Speaker of the State House of Representatives.
		  He had a large brain, but lacked continuity of effort.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday morning ex-Governor William A. Graham, of the class of
		  1824, chosen by the Dialectic Society, delivered the Literary Address. It was
		  read from manuscript, and there was no room for oratory, but the thoughtful
		  auditors pronounced it admirable. The subject was Popular Education, and his
		  thoughts were full of wisdom.</p>
          <p>After this, Dr. ——Togno, a native of Corsica, gave an
		  instructive lecture on grasses, demonstrating their value as a crop, and the
		  neglect of our farmers in cultivating them.</p>
          <p>At twelve o'clock on Wednesday the Alumni Association had their
		  meeting. Plans for the Caldwell monument were submitted. Only $600 had
		  been raised, and it was estimated that $1,000 would be needed. The
		  Committee were instructed to continue their efforts to secure additional funds,
		  and the $3 limit was removed. Obituaries were read of Wm. Sneed (1799),
		  by Prof. W. M. Green; Durant Hatch (1806), by Charles Phillips; James McClung
		  (1816), by Judge Battle; H. W. Covington (1830), by S. F. Phillips; James S.
		  Johnston (1844), by J. H. Horner; David W. Stone, by Dr. Thomas H. Wright.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p522" n="522"/>
          <p>Next in order was an oration by Hon. James T. Morehead, who was a
		  successful lawyer and a member of the General Assembly and of Congress. It was
		  said to exhibit much research of a practical nature and allusions to great
		  minds. He was a favorite with the members of the bar in his circuit, who
		  affectionately called him “Uncle Jimmy.” He was naturally a
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">laudator temporis acti</foreign>.</hi>
		  The last time I saw him he was denouncing the Code of Civil Procedure, then
		  recently imported from New York, and declaring that he would spend the rest of
		  his life procuring its abolition and return to the good old practice. The Code
		  modified outlived him and has come to stay.</p>
          <p>Other Alumni had died during the year, but their obituaries had not
		  been obtained, viz., Francis L. Dancy (1801), Thomas J. Lacey (1821), James
		  Saunders (1830).</p>
          <p>The first distinction was awarded to Kemp P. Battle, Peter M. Hale and
		  Thomas Jefferson Robinson; the second to Thomas Devereux Haigh, James M.
		  Johnson, Charles Eden Lowther, John A. Whitfield. The third to Wm. B. Dortch,
		  Peter E. Hines, J. Calvin McNair, Malcolm McNair, Wm. G. Pool, Charles R.
		  Thomas, and Needham B. Whitfield.</p>
          <p>The Senior speakers were as follows, the three first-honor men having
		  drawn lots as usual for the Latin and the Valedictory. P. E. Hines, James M.
		  Johnson and M. McNair were excused from appearing on the stage, and at their
		  request Thos. M. Arrington, James P. Scales and Fourney George were
		  substituted.</p>
          <p>Salutatory (in Latin), Peter M. Hale.</p>
          <p>“Palestine,” Thomas J. Robinson.</p>

          <p>The Valedictory, Kemp P. Battle.</p>
          <p>Of the honor men of the Class of 1849, Battle was Tutor of Mathematics
		  for four years, then a lawyer, Member of the Convention of 1861, State
		  Treasurer, President of the University, and now Professor of History. Hale was
		  a distinguished editor of the <hi rend="italics">Fayetteville Observer</hi>and
		  the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Observer.</hi>Robinson was a Professor of
		  Mathematics in the United States Naval Academy, a teacher in North Carolina,
		  and Secretary of the State Agricultural Department. Haigh was President of the
		  North Carolina Medical Association and a very prominent physician of
		  Fayetteville; James M. Johnson had uncommon natural talent, singular aptitude
		  for scientific research, but lacked ambition; J. Whitfield was a lawyer of fine
		  promise, reached the rank of Colonel as a dashing soldier, and was killed in
		  the battle of the Wilderness. Hines, Director-General of North Carolina
		  Hospitals, a Brigade Surgeon, C. S. A., and President of the North Carolina
		  Medical Society; John Calvin McNair was a Presbyterian minister, entered the
		  University of Edinburgh and died while a student. He left by will, after the
		  death of his mother, a valuable property in land, slaves and securities to the
		  University of North Carolina for the establishment of a course of lectures by
		  eminent divines on the Harmony between Science and Religion. Owing to the
		  losses of the war nothing was left but land, which has recently been sold for
		  $14,500. Thomas had uncommon gifts as an orator, was Judge and
		  Representative in Congress, member of the Convention of 1861, and Secretary of
		  State. His son of the same name in Congress inherits his gifts.</p>
          <p>Of those matriculating with the class but not graduating, Almand A.
		  McCoy was a State Senator, member of the Convention of 1865, and a Judge of the
		  Superior Court: William H. Moore, a physician and Superintendent of the Colored
		  Insane Asylum at Goldsboro; Alfred Moore Scales, LL D., was a member of the
		  Legislature, a Brigadier-General, C. S. A., a Representative in Congress,
		  Governor of North Carolina, and President of a bank.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>DR. SHIPP.</head>
          <p>Rev. Albert Micajah Shipp was elected Professor of English Literature
		  and History. In 1851 French was <choice><sic>stubstituted</sic><corr>substituted</corr></choice>for
		  English Literature, and in 1854, the French being transferred to M. Herrisse,
		  he had charge of History only and so continued until 1860.</p>
          <p>Dr. Shipp was born in Stokes County, North Carolina, February 15,
		  1819. He was a graduate of the University of North Carolina in 1840, one of the
		  first honor men. He was a Methodist preacher of uncommon power. He was not
		  perhaps a specialist in the studies of his department, but had general
		  cultivation and talents sufficient to enable him to qualify himself. His
		  teaching lacked animation, though in the pulpit his manner was vigorous and
		  exceedingly impressive.</p>
          <p>In the fall of this year Rev. Wm. M. Green left the University to
		  become Bishop of Mississippi, and in 1850 Rev. John Thomas Wheat, of Nashville,
		  Tennessee, took his place. Bishop Green continued in his high office until his
		  death in 1887. After the Civil War he was made Chancellor of the University of
		  the South and often resided at Sewanee. Shortly before his death he revisited
		  his Alma Mater, and the inscription on his tablet in Memorial Hall was penned
		  by himself. He was a saintly man.</p>
          <p>It was determined to enter in earnest on the improvement of the
		  Campus, then still in its primeval state. One thousand dollars yearly for
		  several years were spent under the supervision and personal labor of gardeners
		  trained in England, first one Loader and soon afterwards Paxton, with colored
		  laborers to assist them. They dug up many useless trees, macadamized a large
		  part of Cameron Avenue and the three larger walks leading to the village,
		  bordered two of the latter with beautiful <pb xml:id="p525" n="525"/>flowers,
		  especially roses, and hid the hotel back-yard and stables with osage oranges,
		  hollies and shrubs. After the University lost its endowment the flowers were
		  gradually destroyed by fire or neglect, but the other work is of value to this
		  day. It is possible that the plan of A. J. Davis, architect, of New York, made
		  some years before, may have been followed, but the gardeners understood their
		  business.</p>

          <head>RECOLLECTIONS OF U. N. C. IN THE 40'S.</head>
          <p>After he was made a Judge, an office during good behaviour, that is,
		  practically for life, my father removed his home to Chapel Hill in order to
		  educate his five boys. This was in June, 1843. I was prepared for the
		  University by recent graduates—A. G. Brown and R. Don Wilson— and
		  entered Freshman in 1845. After graduating I was an instructor for one year and
		  Tutor 1850-1854, sleeping in the old East Building. I have therefore vivid
		  recollections of the Faculty and villagers, students and employees, the
		  teaching and curriculum, manners and customs of this period. I propose to
		  introduce them to the reader. The description will show what the University was
		  under President Swain before it reached its greatest numbers.</p>
          <p>1. Taking 1844 as a typical year. There were 64 Trustees They were
		  then chosen by the General Assembly for life. It was considered to be a great
		  honor to be a member. The Board was truly a noble body. At the head was Judge
		  Henry Potter of the United States District Court, elected in the year in which
		  Washington died. Next to him was Judge Gaston of the Supreme Court, elected in
		  1803, and then came John D. Hawkins and Judge Frederick Nash, both chosen in
		  1807. And then came a line of men prominent in our State.</p>
          <p>The Trustees in attendance on the Commencement of 1843 were the
		  following: John M. Morehead, Governor and <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi>
		  President of the Board; George E. Badger, Simmons J. Baker, Wm. H. Battle, John
		  H. Bryan, Weston R. Gales, Wm. A. Graham, James Iredell, Andrew Joyner, Charles
		  Manly, Secretary and Treasurer of the University, Samuel F. Patterson, Thomas
		  Ruffin, James Webb and Jonathan Worth. It would hardly be possible to get
		  together an abler or more worthy body of men. As a rule, they were of imposing
		  physique. Nearly all had attained or were destined to attain high office.
		  Morehead, Graham, Iredell, Manly and Worth occupied. <pb xml:id="p527" n="527"/>the
		  Governor's chair; Badger and Graham were Secretaries of the Navy and Senators
		  of the United States, Iredell likewise a United States Senator, Ruffin was
		  Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and Battle Judge of the Superior and then
		  of the Supreme Court; Bryan had been a member of Congress; Hinton, Patterson
		  and Worth, State Treasurers, and Baker a State legislator, and he and Webb very
		  prominent physicians; Joyner Speaker of the Senate; Gales editor of the leading
		  newspaper and Mayor of Raleigh. “Old Dr. Baker,” as he was then
		  called, wore an old-fashioned cue, and had the courtly manners of the old
		  school. The Trustees sat on the rostrum with President Swain, and each student
		  felt that, whenever in coming years he could be elevated to similar honors, his
		  noblest ambition would be realized.</p>
          <p>Judge Wm. Gaston, one of the greatest “all-round” men this
		  State ever had, was absent from the Commencement of 1844. He died suddenly on
		  January 23d previously. A Faculty Committee, Judge Battle being chairman,
		  reported resolutions on the subject. They declare that his death was “a
		  great loss to the Union, to the State, and to this University,” that
		  “as members of an institution of which he was more than forty years a
		  guardian and benefactor, we feel ourselves called upon in an especial manner to
		  honor his memory, and to propose to the youth committed to our trust his life
		  and character as a noble example of the legitimate results of a pure,
		  well-regulated and virtuous ambition.” This is high praise and is well
		  deserved. It was on his motion, as has been told, seconded by another active
		  and sagacious Trustee, Judge Duncan Cameron, that the Board in 1804 resolved to
		  have a President of the University, instead of a “Presiding
		  Professor,” and unanimously elected the first President, Rev. Joseph
		  Caldwell, twelve years afterward honored with the degree of Doctor of
		  Divinity.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE FACULTY.</head>
          <p>In addition to President Swain and Professor Mitchell, Phillips and
		  Tutor Owen heretofore mentioned, the heads of the departments were John
		  DeBerniere Hooper, A.M., of the Latin and French Languages; Manuel Fetter,
		  A.M., of the Greek <pb xml:id="p528" n="528"/>Language and Literature; Rev. Wm. M.
		  Green, A.M., of Rhetoric and Logic; Rev. Charles M. F. Deems, A.M., Adjutant
		  Professor of Rhetoric and Logic; Ralph Henry Graves, the elder, Tutor of
		  Mathematics.</p>
          <p>In 1844 there were two changes in the Faculty. In January, Ashbel G.
		  Brown, graduate of 1843, took the place Owen resigned, and Charles Phillips, of
		  1841, succeeded Graves, resigned.</p>
          <p>President Swain—never so called, but always Governor
		  Swain—was at the height of his powers, mental and physical. He was bright
		  in conversation, fond of punning, had a powerful memory stored with genealogies
		  of North Carolina families, and anecdotes of public men. He had a kind heart
		  and genial manners. He was not an extensive reader. His range of learning was
		  not wide, but accurate as far as it went. Having lived through important parts
		  of our history, he had absorbed much. When sent by Governor Vance to meet
		  General Sherman, and introduced to one of his aides, Colonel Hitchcock, he
		  surprised the party by saying to the Colonel: “Your mother was a
		  ——. She married your father at ——.” Similarly,
		  students found that he could give them lessons about their ancestors,
		  concerning whom, paternal and maternal, he diligently enquired. He was
		  accustomed to talk familiarly with the students, especially the Seniors. He
		  often visited them at their rooms in the daytime. He seldom went out at night
		  on account of consumptive tendency. In wet weather he would walk to his lecture
		  room, Indian moccasins in one hand and rubber shoes on his feet. His habit was
		  to knock at the doors of students, and, being somewhat deaf, an infirmity which
		  increased as he grew old, to walk in without waiting for a bidding. He thus
		  occasionally found a party seated around a table enjoying a game of cards, then
		  against the laws whether for stakes or for fun. He would confiscate the pack.
		  It was said that he had a bushel basket full at home. He never reported the
		  offenders, except in one case when the playing was on Sunday, and then the
		  perpetrators were suspended. He was too nervous, but after a few pleasant
		  words, would take his leave, making a pun or other humorous remark as a parting
		  gift. His puns were sometimes atrociously bad. I have known
		  <pb xml:id="p529" n="529"/>him to be called back by his visitee with the words,
		  “Come back, Governor; that is not good enough to leave on.” He was
		  always welcomed except when there was a game of cards or other breach of the
		  regulations going on. There was only one instance of disrespect, and that was
		  at a later day, and intended as a practical joke. A student kept excellent
		  shaving apparatus with razor especially sharp. The President often asked the
		  privilege of using it. One morning the owner of the razor substituted a very
		  dull instrument. After making one stroke the President silently washed off his
		  face and left the room never to return, to the penitent grief of the joker. As
		  a rule, however, he took good naturedly impudent fun though aimed at
		  himself.</p>
          <p>He was extremely restive under adverse criticism, and in his
		  precautions to avoid censure was sometimes thought by some not to be ready to
		  sustain in public items of reports of a harsh nature which he approved in
		  committee. The late Colonel W. L. Steele, a Trustee, regular in attendance at
		  Commencements, and on the preliminary examinations, when it was his duty as
		  committeeman, made this charge against the President. The explanation probably
		  was that while he agreed to the truthfulness of the report, he considered it
		  bad policy to communicate names of delinquents to the public. A Mr. Land, of
		  Louisiana, conceiving that his son, who was expelled from the institution, and
		  forced to pay money for damages to University property, had been badly treated,
		  sent a challenge to the President to mortal combat. Prof. Kimberly, with mock
		  gravity, moved that, inasmuch as the age and station of the President prevented
		  acceptance of the challenge, Prof. Fetter should be requested to take his
		  place. Mr. Fetter, although fond of jokes on others, was sensitive at their
		  being perpetrated on himself, repelled the motion with ludicrous heat. “I
		  will not fight! I don't believe in duels.” Young Land was a good soldier,
		  howbeit an unruly student, was killed in the early part of the war.</p>
          <p>One impudent fellow had the presumption to call attention to the
		  President's extraordinary knock-kneed conformation, by <pb xml:id="p530" n="530"/>
		  questioning his ability when a youth to successfully drive a pig, explaining
		  that the animal must have escaped by running between his feet. The silence with
		  which he received this attempted wit was a caustic rebuke. Good mimics, John H.
		  Manly, for example, afterwards Colonel of a regiment and Mayor of Galveston,
		  often imitated his peculiar voice, but never knowingly in his presence. At the
		  sale of the old furniture of the Dialectic Society, the amateur auctioneer, the
		  late Major R. S. Tucker, offered a pair of plated silver candlesticks.
		  “Here, gentlemen, is a combination candlestick and mirror. They have the
		  peculiar power of making an ugly man look handsome. Governor! they are the very
		  thing for you!” The victim laughed as much as the crowd. Tucker was one
		  of his favorites.</p>
          <p>Later on the Governor made a bid on some article. Tucker rattled on,
		  “Don't you hear, gentlemen? Governor Swain bids $—. Don't
		  you know he never pays more than half price for anything?” He took the
		  hit in good part. It was founded on fact, as he was a careful economist. He
		  laughed and said, “That is true—at auctions.”</p>
          <p>Nor was he offended at ridicule of his bad puns, of which he made
		  many. Professor Fetter's name was an obvious target, and the Professor's
		  invariable retort was, “That will do for a beardless Swain.” The
		  Governor's face was nearly free from capillary adornment. He was much pleased
		  at compliments to those puns which were worthy of applause. The following is
		  one of his best. Robert H. Tate, in his Senior speech, spoke of the many uses
		  of the Longleaf Pine, and bemoaned the recent losses to the State from the
		  destruction of extensive forests of that valuable tree by myriads of
		  pestilential insects. “What?”, he asked, “will become of our
		  good old State, if this devastation of our pines goes on?” The answer of
		  the President was, “Re-pine, of course!”</p>
          <p>The following shows in a piquant way the friendly relations between
		  the President and the students. After the marble shaft was erected to the
		  memory of <choice><sic>Presdent</sic><corr>President</corr></choice>Caldwell, leaving the
		  dilapidated sandstone monument first erected, gaunt and hideous, several young
		  fellows waited on President Swain in <pb xml:id="p531" n="531"/>mock gravity,
		  saying, “Governor! we boys have had a meeting and resolved to keep the
		  old monument for you.” For once he did not take the joke with his
		  accustomed hilarity.</p>
          <p>His curiosity for the news was insatiable. Every person arriving on
		  “the Hill” was called on at once by the President and catechized as
		  to what had happened of interest or importance within his knowledge. He kept
		  up, even after postage fell to five cents for any distance, the old custom of
		  sending letters by the hand of travellers, who often had to pay more than the
		  postage to a specially employed delivery messenger. He retained always the
		  practice of economy, which he learned in his straitened youth.</p>
          <p>Although extremely knock-kneed and round-shouldered, and with homely
		  features, his face illumined by a kind heart and by a strong mind, and his tall
		  figure gave him a commanding appearance. On account of his intellectual power,
		  the great offices he had held, his influence over Faculty and Trustees,
		  together with courtesy to old and young and his inclination to merciful dealing
		  with offenders, “Old Bunk,” as he was called behind his back, was
		  almost universally popular with the students. I think he was intentionally
		  insulted only once during his incumbency. That was when a Mississippi student,
		  really crazy from whiskey, threw a chair in his direction, but did not touch
		  him. The offender was dismissed, then expelled for refusing to leave Chapel
		  Hill as the law required. He redeemed his wildness by becoming a good citizen
		  and an officer in the church, and was killed in the Civil War, having reached
		  the rank of Captain.</p>
          <p>The President's deafness, which sorely affected him in his latter
		  years, was of no great inconvenience at this period of his life.</p>
          <p>For the most of the period the President taught the Seniors
		  Constitutional and International, or as he published it, National Law,
		  Intellectual Philosophy and Moral Science. The mode of recitation was almost
		  altogether by questions and answers, the President adhering closely to the
		  text. He required the table of contents or marginal topics to be memorized in
		  order, an exaction considered by the class as burdensome. Occasionally
		  <pb xml:id="p532" n="532"/>he lectured most interestingly on such subjects as Magna
		  Carta, the Petition and Bill of Rights, the character of the great men of North
		  Carolina and the United States.</p>
          <p>He introduced greater system in keeping the records of the students
		  for scholarship and punctuality. Tables exist showing in his handwriting the
		  standing of each after every examination, and the absences from Prayers, from
		  Recitations, and from religious services in the Chapel.</p>
          <p>Circular letters were sent to each parent or guardian, showing the
		  standing of the student, and earnestly advising that they should not be allowed
		  to buy anything on credit. At the end of the terms, then called sessions, the
		  grades were reported. The President filled these out with his own hand, which
		  was often tremulous. One parent told him that after careful study he had been
		  unable to ascertain whether his son's standing was g-o-o-d or b-a-d.</p>
          <p>President Swain was strict in requiring formal Faculty meetings once a
		  week, usually on Friday night. At first these were held at the dwellings of the
		  Faculty alternately, but afterwards at the President's. Tutors were considered
		  regular members, entitled to vote. Informal meetings were held in the
		  afternoons after Prayers, a majority of the Faculty usually being present. He
		  introduced the practice of having the regular meetings opened with prayer by
		  one of the clergy present. Then the roll of the students was called over twice,
		  absences recorded, and all instances of misbehaviour discussed. The following
		  partial list shows the character of the offences appearing on the Conduct Book:
		  “Talking or laughing at recitations or Prayers”; “Spitting on
		  the floor”; “Blowing a trumpet in study hours”; “Being
		  out of one's room in study hours”; “Bringing book into recitation
		  room”; “Throwing a bucket of water on a student”;
		  “Shouting too loud when drenched”; “Loud shouting”;
		  “Riding horseback in Campus”; “Shooting pistols”;
		  “Exploding gunpowder”; “Hoisting pigs with ropes as they fed
		  under the windows,” and so on.</p>
          <p>The next business in order was the trial of those who were cited to
		  appear to answer serious charges. The Professor making the charge was first
		  heard, and then the accused answered. <pb xml:id="p533" n="533"/>As a rule his
		  statement was accepted. The members of the Faculty were then invited one by
		  one, beginning with the youngest, to ask questions or make comments, which were
		  sometimes caustic, sometimes kindly. Some made it a rule to keep silence. After
		  this ordeal the offender retired and the vote was taken on the case, beginning
		  with the Tutors, according to the court-martial rule, adopted to prevent junior
		  officers being overawed by their superiors. The theory was that the majority
		  ruled, but in practice, if the President thought best not to punish, he was
		  sure to carry his point. Sometimes his leniency did not escape criticism on the
		  part of his colleagues, and on one occasion a committee of the Trustees
		  instructed their chairman, ex-Governor Iredell, to announce publicly from the
		  rostrum at Commencement their opinion that it was injuring the institution. The
		  President answered the charge with spirit, even with heat, we must presume
		  satisfactorily, as the subject was not mentioned again.</p>
          <p>The cases of discipline being disposed of, opportunity was given for a
		  general discussion of the condition of the institution. No rules of order were
		  deemed necessary, nor were lacking agreeable pleasantries and instructive
		  comments on the affairs of the State and General Government. Sometimes, but not
		  often, there would be heated differences of opinion.</p>
          <p>Whether it arose from the President's politic carefulness or his
		  nervousness, his usual rule was to appoint professors to write to parents about
		  the delinquencies of their sons. Professors were also entrusted with the duty
		  of admonishing those who needed to be rebuked or stirred up. In choosing the
		  mentors, regard was had to considerations of their likelihood of being able to
		  exert special influence from acquaintance with parents, church affiliations and
		  the like.</p>
          <p>As a rule he consulted the Faculty about other matters before acting,
		  but was annoyed when they differed from him. By adroit management he generally
		  carried his point, without causing dissatisfaction. He had decided ideas in
		  regard to his prerogative. He often quoted the words of ex-Judge Duncan Cameron
		  that the Captain of the University should have powers similar to those of a
		  captain of a ship. When Professor DeBerniere <pb xml:id="p534" n="534"/>Hooper
		  wished for leave of absence at the close of the academic year, 1836-'7, the
		  year be it noted of his marriage, the President, who believed that Commencement
		  should be made as imposing as possible, declined permission, whereupon
		  Professor Hooper appealed to the Faculty with success. Nothing daunted, the
		  President carried the question before the Trustees and triumphed. He was a
		  Trustee for life before he became President, and attended the meetings of the
		  Board by right and not by courtesy. In general it may be said that the Trustees
		  carried into effect his recommendations, but it should be observed that he was
		  a cautious man and was careful to recommend nothing which would probably be
		  disapproved. He prided himself on being independent of the Trustees, and often
		  stated that for this reason he made it a rule never to invest a dollar in
		  Chapel Hill property. He was prudent in money matters, as was his wife, and at
		  death was worth at least $60,000, notwithstanding the losses of the war.
		  It was an instance of his prudence that about 1862 he sold $10,000 stock
		  in the Bank of North Carolina and invested the proceeds in a plantation in Pitt
		  County.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Swain, a granddaughter of Governor Caswell, a woman of fine
		  intellect but retiring disposition, cared nothing for Society, and therefore
		  the President did not dispense a large hospitality. As he did not for reasons
		  of health often attend entertainments at night, there were not many at his
		  home. Occasionally, however, he was the host of distinguished visitors, such as
		  President Buchanan and Secretary Thompson, President Johnson, Secretary Seward,
		  Postmaster-General Randall, and Governor Graham. And rarely he gave a banquet
		  to the Trustees, Seniors and others.</p>
          <p>In his domestic government he was conspicuously lenient. The neighbors
		  thought that he “spoilt,” to use a common term, his children and
		  his slaves. A story was told with much glee, how, when irritated beyond measure
		  by his washerwoman, he seized a switch to punish her, she said with satirical
		  emphasis, “Whip away! I can supply back as long as you can supply
		  whip!” His female slaves multiplied rapidly, although they did not enter
		  into the matrimonial engagements usual among <pb xml:id="p535" n="535"/>slaves,
		  which though not binding in law, were as much respected in fact as are now
		  legal marriages in some of our States. One of his women was a grandmother at
		  twenty-seven years of age. Some of them became conspicuous for fidelity and
		  efficiency in after life. One, Wilson Swain Caldwell, for instance, was for
		  many years one of the most trusted and efficient University servants, with the
		  unbounded respect of Faculty and students. He held the office, though not with
		  the name, of Janitor.</p>
          <p>President Swain occasionally gave public lectures to the University
		  officers and students, the villagers being also invited. I can recall one on
		  the early history of the University, one on the comparative rank of North
		  Carolina in geographical position, wealth, and population; another on the
		  Importance of Agriculture; a fourth, which was published, on Military
		  Operations in North Carolina in 1776. He had a floating intention to visit
		  England in search for papers relating to our history, but the General Assembly,
		  while appointing him agent for this purpose, made no appropriation for
		  expenses. He wrote in an uncommonly good style some historical papers for the
		  <hi rend="italics">University Magazine</hi>on the War of the Regulation, and
		  edited publications of papers of Governor Burke, Whitmill Hill, Cornelius
		  Harnett, and others, mostly obtained from the collection of Judge Murphey. The
		  history of this collection will be found in the second volume.</p>
          <p>The President was a Presbyterian, an Elder in the Church, but I never
		  heard of his praying or discoursing in public. There is a tablet to his memory
		  in the Presbyterian Church at Chapel Hill. Mrs. Swain was a Methodist, but an
		  infrequent attendant at church.</p>
          <p>The President is commonly censured for using his influence to keep the
		  North Carolina Railroad from coming to Chapel Hill, alleging that it would
		  facilitate the running off of students during term time. It certainly was his
		  policy, as was the policy of his predecessors, to keep the University
		  dormitories isolated. No road was allowed through the Campus. A rail fence,
		  along which a hedgerow grew up, separated the tree-covered part of it from the
		  open field on the eastern side, and there was no <pb xml:id="p536" n="536"/>access
		  to the Raleigh road. Carriages could only reach the buildings by the west. Dr.
		  Mitchell, as had been said, endeavored to have two public roads, one in the
		  rear of the South Building and the other along the Old East, but the project
		  failed. Still, I think that Governor Swain should not be held responsible for
		  the railroad going by Hillsboro. In the first place its most powerful
		  <choice><sic>promotors</sic><corr>promoters</corr></choice>, ex-Governor Morehead, ex-Governor
		  Graham, John W. Norwood, Giles Mebane, Cadwallader Jones, the elder, John A.
		  Gilmer, Ralph P. Gorrell, Paul C. Cameron, Calvin Graves, and other men,
		  influential not only as stockholders to a large amount but as public leaders,
		  without whose active labors the State appropriation could not have been
		  procured, lived along the Hillsboro route. In the second place, the Chief
		  Engineer, Col. Walter Gwynne, reported against the route by Chapel Hill. In his
		  report of 1851 he says, “The result by any combination that could be made
		  would be in favor of the route by Hillsboro in all the essentials of grades,
		  cost, curvature and distance.” Again, “Owing to the frequent
		  deflections this, (the Chapel Hill) route, although called the direct route,
		  would be about two miles longer than the line by Hillsboro, and a comparison of
		  the grades, curvature and cost would also be against it.”</p>
          <p>Against the opposition of the most powerful stockholders and the
		  adverse report of the Chief Engineer, of course President Swain could do
		  nothing. It was wise in him to yield gracefully and to get what comfort he
		  could from the inevitable.</p>
          <p>As sustaining my charitable view, I add on the testimony of Mr. Paul
		  C. Cameron that President Swain certainly advocated the Chapel Hill route
		  before a meeting of the stockholders, while he himself urged that the road
		  should go by his Farintosh and Flat River plantations, east of the adopted
		  line. On the whole, I conclude that the President would not have opposed its
		  location near the University if it could possibly have been procured, and that
		  he persuaded himself that its loss was best for University discipline.</p>
          <p>The Faculty of President Swain's early incumbency was very little
		  changed for many years. When changes occurred by death or resignation, the new
		  professors did not sensibly <pb xml:id="p537" n="537"/>modify the accustomed order.
		  The fashion of discipline and instruction set by Dr. Caldwell and his
		  coadjutors, less sternly administered, however, was continued.</p>
          <p>The Senior Professor, Dr. Elisha Mitchell, nicknamed “Old
		  Mike” by the students, had a big frame and a big brain. While his body
		  was formed for strength and not for grace, his face was handsome and
		  intellectual. He might have been among the great specialists of this country,
		  if he had not aspired to be universally learned. To his students he appeared to
		  know everything in literature and science. He seemed familiar not only with
		  flowers and rocks, minerals and ores, and the secrets of chemistry and physics,
		  but with questions of fiction and poetry, theology and law, history and art. He
		  was a strong mathematician, indeed, as has been shown, was professor in that
		  department for several years. He once taught rhetoric and logic. He read
		  Blackstone for recreation. He was well versed in the classics and was a good
		  theologian. When a Junior he said to me, “Do you believe that Solomon had
		  seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines?” I replied that I
		  thought I was bound to believe it. He said, “Well! I do not. The Bible
		  comes to us after numerous transcriptions. A slight mark in Hebrew will make
		  hundreds or thousands more or less. Perhaps some transcriber, Jewish of course,
		  accidentally, or on purpose to increase the glory of Solomon, altered the
		  figures.” This was my first experience of the Higher Criticism. His
		  sermons were good, but were delivered in such a tame manner, without gesture
		  and without raising his eyes from the manuscript, that they left no lasting
		  impression as a whole. Particular expressions were remembered from their
		  quaintness. For example, he began a sermon on Moral Courage thus: “If a
		  man walking on the street sees a mad bull charging on him with lowered horns,
		  and hastens to leap the fence to escape, he is not a coward. If he does not, he
		  is a fool.” His prayers appeared to the youthful mind of undue length.
		  They were always the same, and when he came to “line upon line, precept
		  upon precept, here a little and there a little,” we knew that he was half
		  through and a thrill of gladness entered our souls.</p>
          <p>While Dr. Mitchell was curious to know everything, he was
		  <pb xml:id="p538" n="538"/>also ready for active work wherever called for. It was
		  said that a year's term of Chairman of the Faculty after Caldwell's death left
		  him willing to undertake the Presidency. He was one of the most diligent in
		  enforcing discipline, and as he had a bed in his private room in the South
		  Building, in which he frequently spent his nights, was commonly on hand to lend
		  his aid in preventing or suppressing riotous conduct. Once while Faison was
		  running from hot pursuit of a Tutor, he leaped out of a door of the South
		  Building right into Dr. Mitchell's arms, and was held in his embrace. The fun
		  of the thing moved F.'s risibles and he burst into a jovial laugh. While often
		  detecting offenders, the good Professor was very merciful in punishment.</p>
          <p>He was, as has been told, the Bursar, and kept the accounts of the
		  students. This involved much labor both of collecting and paying out money for
		  tuition, room rent, servant hire, board, washing, and other expenses. The law
		  required all funds of students, even pocket-money, to be deposited with him, a
		  law smacking of espionage, and not obeyed except as to what was needed for
		  expenses of board, books, and the like. No one ever saw his books, and it was a
		  common belief that he carried all their accounts in his head, but this could
		  not have been true. The only concrete criticism by the students was as to the
		  deposit money. Each was required to pay $4 per annum to defray the
		  expenses of damages to University property not traceable to any perpetrator. At
		  the end of the session the unused residue was returned. As the students knew
		  nothing of the aggregate damages, there was ample room for disappointment, and
		  so they jocularly called the Bursar's old gray horse “Old
		  Deposits,” as having been paid for out of the fund. Often in emergencies
		  he employed his own property, slaves or horses and wagons, in aid of the
		  University, and repaid himself in a rough way in kind.</p>
          <p>As Bursar he took charge of all needed ordinary work and repairs,
		  building stone walls and the like. As Town Commissioner, he improved our
		  streets by supporting walls and culverts, and as Justice of the Peace he was
		  always ready to try the petty cases of a sparse neighborhood. Occasionally in
		  <pb xml:id="p539" n="539"/>affrays among students, where serious trouble was
		  threatened, he forced the fighters to give security to keep the peace.</p>
          <p>As a teacher he was very interesting, often illustrating the subject
		  by facts of history and even amusing anecdotes, at which he laughed as heartily
		  as the students. I remember that one of my classmates had the habit of giving a
		  convulsive snort, instead of genuine laughter. Once this was not uttered until
		  the rest of us subsided into quiet, so that it sounded like ridicule. The
		  Professor angrily said, “Is that man a fool that he cannot appreciate a
		  joke?” At one period he read written lectures of his own on Chemistry,
		  Geology and Mineralogy. The notes of these were handed on from class to class,
		  and on the margin were the entries, “Here comes in the joke about A.
		  B.,” “Here comes in the joke about C. D.,” and so on. He did
		  not often make a slip. I remember one. He taught the Junior class Sunday
		  afternoons in the Books of Kings. During the first term he finished the first
		  book. The next term we were dreading the complicated reigns of the kings of
		  Judah and Israel, when to our delight he began the first book again and never
		  discovered the reiteration. We did not undeceive him.</p>
          <p>In the laboratory he performed experiments well. The transformations
		  he predicted all came according to the prophecy. But he did not require the
		  students to work with their own hands. Indeed, there was not room for it in the
		  combined lecture-hall and laboratory, which was on the first floor of the South
		  Building, south side.</p>
          <p>As a citizen, Dr. Mitchell was kind-hearted and public-spirited, ready
		  to give counsel or material aid to all who asked for it, fond of humor, as well
		  as grave conversation. He enjoyed a joke on himself if there was no malice. To
		  a retort of a member of my class he laughed and said, “Well, Mr.
		  Dusenbury! I forgive the impudence of that for the wit of it.” On a
		  geological excursion with his class, when Vance invited him to go out of his
		  way to inspect a newly found red stratum, and he found a divided watermelon, he
		  said, “That Vance is a funny fellow,” but he declined to partake of
		  the fruit because he doubted Vance's title and would not be guilty of
		  concealing <pb xml:id="p540" n="540"/>stolen goods in his capacious stomach.
		  Passing an old mill-house near an empty pond he was much <choice><sic>amuused</sic><corr>amused</corr></choice>at Vance's pretended grave inquiry, “Doctor,
		  do you think that mill is worth a <hi rend="italics">dam?</hi>” Once when
		  I showed displeasure at a coarse joke by a Professor in which the name of a
		  refined young lady, then a guest at my father's, was mentioned, he paid me a
		  special visit to endeavor to persuade me that I was wrong. “People are
		  becoming too squeamish,” he said; “when my wife was a girl she and
		  her friends used to play dolls with human bones, which her father, Dr. North,
		  had in his garret. The relations between the sexes were established by God, and
		  there is no harm in talking about having children.” I was not convinced,
		  although I appreciated his kindness.</p>
          <p>The Doctor was one day explaining the transmission of qualities of
		  mind and body by heredity. “Yes, gentlemen, often if you know the father
		  and mother of a student and their idiosyncracies, you can form a fair estimate
		  of his character.” Then turning to a tall, dignified member of the class,
		  whose father he well knew, he said, “Mr. Alexander! what is your mother's
		  name?” “Vi'let, sir!” was the answer. The Doctor laughed with
		  the class and said, “well, I admit that I can not estimate your character
		  from that name. I enquired after her family name.”</p>
          <p>He explored thoroughly the woods and fields around Chapel Hill,
		  showing the love for solitary journeyings which led him to make excursions over
		  our mountains and other parts of the State, evincing the same self-reliance
		  which led him to his death on Mt. Mitchell. The University has his manuscript
		  book of notes. It has a dedication “To Myself.”</p>
          <p>He was charitable to the extent of his ability. My observation was
		  that he and others of like heart in Chapel Hill were greatly imposed upon by a
		  few who were, not too proud, but too lazy to dig, and not ashamed to beg. One
		  of his benefactions was a standing source of merriment to the villagers. He
		  lent money to a neighbor on mortgage of his home. He was compelled to foreclose
		  and buy the property to save his debt. The wife of the debtor, Mrs. Snipes,
		  declared that she would not vacate her dwelling. Her husband died, and still
		  she stood <pb xml:id="p541" n="541"/>firm. The good Doctor was too kindhearted to
		  eject her by legal process, and so she continued for years, paying neither
		  interest nor rent. The Doctor was reading in the Bible one Sunday,
		  “Beware of Scribes . . . which devour widows' houses and for a pretense
		  make long prayers.” My next neighbor, his son-in-law, Ashe, whispered to
		  me, “the widow Snipes!” The remark exactly fitted the controversy
		  of Mitchell <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi>Snipes, coupled with the Doctor's
		  longitudinous petitions, and was acutely ludicrous.</p>
          <p>One weakness the Doctor had—impatience of criticism or
		  contradiction. I will give an instance. When the old road, ascending the Piney
		  Prospect hill on the north, became, about 1840, almost impassible, it was
		  resolved to make a new road on the south side, beginning about two miles from
		  the village. He was selected as the engineer, and laid out a fairly good
		  highway, but ascending the hill by quite a steep grade. Afterwards Professor
		  Green was made road-overseer, and he deemed it his duty, although at
		  considerable expense to himself, to adopt a much more gentle grade, using his
		  own negroes in aid of the county “hands.” Dr. Mitchell was so
		  incensed at this implied reflection on his skill that he called Professor Green
		  “no gentleman” and declined to speak to him afterwards.</p>
          <p>He also showed much intolerance against allowing any students to
		  attend church services on Sunday morning elsewhere than in the University
		  Chapel, as proposed by Prof. Green, and he, as well as other members of the
		  Faculty, always became heated in discussing the subject. He was engaged
		  <choice><sic>occasionaally</sic><corr>occasionally</corr></choice>in newspaper controversies,
		  notably with the State Geologist, Dr. Emmons. The dispute was whether the Deep
		  River coal deposit is a veritable coal bed or only a vein. Although denounced
		  and ridiculed by speculators who wished that Emmons was right, the developments
		  since, it is said, show that the dip of the stratum of coal is holding the same
		  angle as was then known and that Mitchell possessed the superior sagacity. In
		  his controversy with General Clingman on the subject of Mount Mitchell,
		  conducted in excellent temper on both sides, he carried his point. After his
		  death the General magnanimously yielded.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p542" n="542"/>
          <p>The Professor of Mathematics, Rev. James Phillips, to whom this
		  University gave the degree of D.D. when he was absent as a Visitor to West
		  Point in 1851, was a very strong character. As a preacher he was singularly
		  gifted in the ability by words, tone and sincerity of manner to touch the
		  heart. His prayers were with the earnestness and pathos of one standing in the
		  presence of God. His heart was large and kindly. He was as firm as adamant in
		  his opinions. He was a most accurate scholar, especially in Theology and
		  Mathematics, Natural and Applied. His lectures on Physics are written elegantly
		  and clearly, without interlineation, and embracing the latest researches of his
		  time. When the teaching force was enlarged, his work was confined mainly to
		  Pure Mathematics. His teaching was somewhat mechanical, taking the propositions
		  in regular order and, as a rule, calling up the students alphabetically. The
		  idlers took advantage of this and calculated not only the day when their turn
		  came, but often the problems which would fall to their lot. Like many teachers
		  he had certain phrases, which he was fond of using. He would say, “Mr.
		  B., I don't see dat,” “Mr. A., that oversteps the modesty of
		  nature!”</p>
          <p>In my day he kept excellent order in his classes. Besides his natural
		  dignity, the boys were impressed by the fact that his youth had been spent in
		  Old England, his native land, and he had gazed on the great Napoleon as he
		  paced the deck of the <hi rend="italics">Bellerophon.</hi></p>
          <p>It was believed, too, that he was an expert in fencing and the use of
		  the single stick, and the knotted cane with which he walked was looked on with
		  awe. Freshmen were stuffed with the absurd story that he was a reformed pirate,
		  but the truth was that he had been a church member from boyhood, first of the
		  Church of England before reaching maturity, and then a devout Presbyterian.</p>
          <p>The following rhymes by James D. Lynch, of Virginia, afterwards of
		  Mississippi, author of a Centennial Ode of merit, who was a student in
		  1855-'58, well expresses the fate of an ignorant student:</p>

          <p>Owing to his English birth, his college name was Old Bull, or Old
		  Johnny.</p>
          <p>Dr. Phillips occasionally preached at night in the village chapel. His
		  regular charge was New Hope Church, about six miles north of the village.</p>
          <p>He was a hard student. The light from his little window upstairs over
		  the parlor of the dwelling, where resides President Venable, was one of the
		  latest in the village. He had a good library, mainly theological, which, after
		  his death, was given by his daughter to the University.</p>
          <p>Professor Manuel Fetter, although his students teased him in his
		  recitation room, had a warm place in their hearts. He was well versed in the
		  reading and parsing of Greek, but had the defect of most classical teachers of
		  his day, that of not calling attention to the literary excellence of the books
		  he taught. He was minutely strict in carrying out the rules, and was very
		  sensitive to ridicule. Sometimes students intentionally committed breaches of
		  the regulations or of etiquette, in order to laugh at his evidences of
		  annoyance. But even these, and certainly all the well-behaved, carried to their
		  homes respect and affection for “Old Fet.”</p>
          <p>In teaching he placed great stress on the “Dictionary
		  meaning,” Liddell and Scott being his <hi rend="italics">sine qua
		  non.</hi>No alternative reading was favored, so that those who wished good
		  marks were driven to much turning of leaves. Those who studied Greek for the
		  grandeur of thought and beauty of imagery were not pleased, but those who
		  wished familiarity with the grammatical structure of the language, the
		  declensions and tenses, dialects and derivations of words, obtained as much as
		  they could carry off.</p>
          <p>It is said that when he first came from the North he knew nothing of
		  gardening. After he planted his “sweet potato” slips, he was
		  shocked to find that the growing of the tubers had <pb xml:id="p544" n="544"/>
		  caused little fissures in the earth of the hills. He consulted his neighbor,
		  Mr. Snipes, about the difficulty. “The remedy is easy,” said
		  Snipes, “take some lime mortar and plaster up the cracks.” And so
		  indeed he did. He afterwards became a most skillful gardener.</p>
          <p>He was perhaps too strict in reporting indecorums for the demerit
		  roll, and calling larger offenders before the Faculty. Once he brought on
		  himself some ridicule. He asked a student, James W. Wilson, who afterward
		  became an eminent Civil Engineer, the name of an ancient river, Oenoe, or Enoe,
		  pronounced En-o-e. Wilson, who had often fished in the stream running through
		  Orange County, confidently replied, “E-no, Sir!” There was a
		  general laugh and he was ordered before the Faculty for disturbing the
		  recitation. In reply to the charge he said, “Governor! how do you
		  pronounce E-n-o-e?” “E-no, Sir!” was the reply. “Well,
		  Sir! Mr. Fetter summoned me for pronouncing the word just as you do.” Of
		  course he was acquitted and the Faculty thought the joke was against the
		  Professor.</p>
          <p>Sometimes a student would hold his text-book under his cloak and gaze
		  intently at it as if he were reading a novel. The Professor would administer a
		  rebuke for violating the law, when the cloak would be thrown open and, with an
		  injured tone, the question would be asked, “What, Mr. Fetter! is it
		  against the law to read my text-book?” Sometimes his feet, uncommonly
		  large, would be gazed at with faces expressing wonder. As his chair was on a
		  platform elevated two feet above the floor, there was no way of avoiding the
		  inspection, and his annoyance was plainly visible.</p>
          <p>Occasionally several students would groan without opening their lips,
		  so that it was impossible to discern which of the innocent-looking youths were
		  guilty. Occasionally nearly all the class would march behind the Professor, as
		  he repaired to the Chapel for Evening Prayer. Those in front were usually
		  summoned before the Faculty for a reprimand. Of course ridiculous questions
		  were sometimes asked as gravely as if the speakers actually sought knowledge.
		  The old torment of cat calls was not wanting and in acorn and chinquepin
		  seasons these nuts would be rattled across the room.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p545" n="545"/>
          <p>Another mode of teasing Mr. Fetter was to induce a large number of the
		  class (there were always about a half a dozen who would not join them) to
		  “snap,” that is, to absent themselves from the recitation room, or
		  to “fess,” that is, to decline answering questions. They invariably
		  were discomfited in the end, the Faculty requiring them to recite the lesson,
		  with the alternative of being dismissed. Twenty-five members of a Freshman
		  Bible class, however, submitted to this penalty, because when their regular
		  teacher was absent, they claimed that they were not bound to recite to another.
		  Of course there was the usual submission and restoration.</p>
          <p>Similar to this was the fate of a class locked out of their room by
		  some sly youth pouring shot into the capacious key holes, into which fitted
		  brass keys nearly or quite a foot long. The locked out Professor would direct
		  the class to follow him to the Chapel or to other vacant rooms, but was
		  generally disobeyed, except by a faithful few. Other instructors anticipated
		  the ringing of the bell by five minutes so that, if the lock had been tampered
		  with, a servant with an axe could break into the room and the damage charged to
		  “Deposites.”</p>
          <p>In 1844 Professor Fetter, as the phrase of the day had it,
		  “disapproved,” or “glistered,” all the Junior class,
		  except three, on the Medea of Euripides. The unfortunates dressed the book in
		  black crape, marched by the Professor's home in solemn procession, and then
		  back to the Davie Poplar and buried it with funeral honors. Over it was a slab
		  of sandstone on which was inscribed <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Hic
		  Jacet Medea</foreign>.</hi>On the corner, in small letters, was “E.
		  Hinton, sculpsit.” It is to be regretted that it was not allowed to
		  remain in honor of the graduating class of 1845.</p>
          <p>These instances suffice to show the nature of the teasing to which the
		  Professor was occasionally subjected.</p>
          <p>Professor John DeBerniere Hooper, descended from a brother of the
		  Signer of the Declaration of Independence, and on his mother's side from a
		  noble French Huguenot family, was Professor of Latin and French until 1848. He
		  had a strict sense of duty. In enforcing the old-fashioned rules of discipline
		  he concluded that they caused evasions and deceits <pb xml:id="p546" n="546"/>among
		  the students and hostility toward the Faculty. So he afterwards resigned his
		  Professorship and undertook the work of school teaching. He was a man of
		  peculiarly gentle manners, but he gave the impression of possessing great
		  reserve power. The noisiest students were quiet in his presence. He was
		  regarded as a broad and accurate scholar. He was such an excellent writer that
		  he was more than once selected to deliver Commencement addresses, but his
		  modesty forced him to decline. No student ever dared to treat him with
		  ridicule. His manner was gentlemanly, and so decided and firm, and his rebukes
		  so just, that offenders could not answer him with rudeness. He had no other
		  nick-name than the abbreviation Hoop, or Old Hoop.</p>
          <p>As a teacher of Latin, while exacting in parsing and constructions, he
		  took pains to point out the excellencies of style and thought, but neither he,
		  nor the Professor of Greek, required the translation of English into Latin or
		  Greek. In teaching French he was successful in regard to reading and
		  construction, but his pronunciation was said by experts to have been formed
		  from the teaching of books. There was no attempt to train the students in
		  conversation in that language.</p>
          <p>Professor Hooper was brother of Johnston Hooper, the Alabama lawyer,
		  who wrote Simon Suggs and other humorous stories, once very popular.</p>
          <p>Professor William Mercer Green, afterward Bishop of Mississippi,
		  Professor of Rhetoric and Logic, also Chaplain of the University, combined in a
		  great degree suavity of manners with strength of character. He was a good
		  teacher, as far as he went, but his heart seemed to be in his clerical duties
		  more than in his department. In his Chapel preaching he carefully refrained
		  from inculcating doctrines peculiar to his denomination. His sermons were
		  always sensible and interesting, but he could not be called eloquent. His
		  delivery was smooth and graceful, but not energetic.</p>
          <p>In 1844 he inaugurated two enterprises which he prosecuted with great
		  energy, which will be more fully described. The first was the building of the
		  first church in the village, the Episcopal, which he succeeded in finishing
		  largely of his own <pb xml:id="p547" n="547"/>means. The second was allowing the
		  students the option of attending divine service in the village instead of in
		  the University Chapel (Gerrard Hall). A full account of this controversy is
		  given elsewhere. The whole system of compulsory attendance may sound well, but
		  in practice it did not conduce to edifying. There are very many more active
		  religious men under the voluntary plan.</p>
          <p>His instruction in Blair's Rhetoric was satisfactory, but in Logic it
		  was deficient, merely requiring the careful study of Hedge's treatise, a
		  diminutive book. Besides these he had a class in Vandenhoff's Elocution. We
		  thought the gesticulation and intonation too mechanical, indeed unnatural.
		  There was a similar defect in his preaching. The language and style were good,
		  the thoughts excellent, of the most approved orthodoxy, but there was lacking
		  fire, enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>He was of boundless kind-heartedness and benevolence. I heard him say
		  that when a boy he shot a woodpecker and grieved over it with occasional tears
		  for a whole day. He allowed his slaves to impose on his easy temper to the
		  indignation of his neighbors. Particularly one Sam, by deception as to his sore
		  hand, escaped all work. My classmate, Young, one of the best men in the world,
		  who had a room on the Professor's lot, was so delighted at seeing him,
		  irritated beyond endurance, take up a switch to punish Sam, that he forgot
		  himself, threw up his window and shouted, “Give him h—l!”</p>
          <p>Once, when there was a scare about the insurrection of the negroes,
		  for which there was not the slightest foundation, Sam loudly asserted his
		  innocence; “When I rises I rises to do my master's work!” The
		  ludicrousness of this declaration from one who avoided all work tended to allay
		  the panic. The Bishop's conscientiousness is evident by the fact that he lost
		  most of a brick kiln, worth $250, by having the fires extinguished on
		  Saturday night, so as to relieve the <choice><sic>loborers</sic><corr>laborers</corr></choice>from
		  work on Sunday, a strange construction of Christ's words about the ox or ass
		  falling into a pit. He carried on a small farm, now called Tenny's plantation.
		  I have known of his lending a driver and a pair of mules for several days to a
		  neighbor for a trip to Raleigh, when they were needed on the farm.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p548" n="548"/>
          <p>Besides conducting prayers every morning and preaching every alternate
		  Sunday in Gerrard Hall, Professor Green officiated once a month in a Chapel
		  erected by Judge Duncan Cameron on his Farintosh plantation. He also
		  occasionally conducted the services of his church in his parlor and in the
		  Episcopal Church, when finished. He, however, declined being Rector of the
		  Parish.</p>
          <p>His manners under all circumstances were those of a polished
		  gentleman; his conduct regulated by a Christian's sense of duty.</p>
          <p>Professor Charles Force Deems, in addition to his work in his own
		  department, had a class in Horace and the Bible. He did not care for the
		  niceties of parsing and grammar, but brought out the literary power of the work
		  studied remarkably well. He was not much over twenty-one years old, was admired
		  as a preacher of clearness, force and eloquence. He seldom officiated before
		  the students, but often preached at Orange Church in the country, and was
		  pastor of the Methodist congregation of the village, whose church, named
		  Bethesda, was a plain room above a store, with only backless benches for seats.
		  Of all the teachers of Latin I have known he was the most happy in showing the
		  force and beauty of the poetry of Horace. He treated everyone with the utmost
		  politeness and kindness, and was not watchful in preventing fraud. It was not
		  uncommon for students to recite to him out of Smart's Horace, which had
		  interlinear translations. At one time by a strange misunderstanding he was
		  exceedingly unpopular. He was involved in a controversy with the father of two
		  students and the strong feeling engendered was of course shared by the sons. It
		  led to throwing stones into a room which he visited in pursuance of his duty.
		  It is evidence of his freedom from resentment that he always retained love for
		  the University and showed it practically years afterward by a beneficient
		  donation of money to be loaned to needy students, called the Theodore Deems
		  Fund. It was named in honor of his oldest son, who was born at Chapel Hill and,
		  becoming a Confederate soldier, was killed in service. Except with the students
		  mentioned and their immediate friends he was very popular.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p549" n="549"/>
          <p>As a preacher his sermons were distinguished by clearness and
		  practical bearing on the duties of life. His manner was simple and unaffected,
		  and his discourses so impressive as not easily to be forgotten. I remember much
		  of one of his sermons, the subject being “Truth,” after the lapse
		  of sixty years. He left the University in 1848. Nominally he was Adjunct
		  Professor of Rhetoric and Logic. His work in the department was chiefly the
		  correction of compositions and original speeches. He published a volume of
		  discourses preached at Chapel Hill, entitled “Twelve College
		  Sermons.” After he became a distinguished preacher in New York he gave,
		  in one of his books, a list of those who most influenced his life. Among them
		  were of the University of North Carolina Faculty, David L. Swain, Elisha
		  Mitchell, James Phillips and William H. Battle.</p>
          <p>On October 3, 1845, the Department of Law was established with William
		  Horn Battle as Professor, but without any responsibility for the discipline of
		  students. Indeed, for several years the names of his students were not
		  published in the catalogues. A native of Edgecombe, he graduated at the
		  University in 1820 among the highest in his class. Studying law at the school
		  of Chief Justice Henderson in Williamsboro, Granville County, he settled in
		  Louisburg. In addition to his practice at the bar he republished Haywood's
		  reports with annotations, was one of the Revisers of the Revised Statutes of
		  1835, and for several years joint Reporter of the Decisions of the Supreme
		  Court with Thomas P. Devereux. On the resignation of Mr. Devereux in 1839 he
		  became sole Reporter and removed his residence to Raleigh. In 1840 he was
		  elected Judge of the Superior Court and soon afterward made his home in Chapel
		  Hill for the purpose of educating his sons. He was an ardent lover of his
		  profession and engaged in politics only a short while, serving in the General
		  Assembly as a Whig from a Democratic County in 1833-35. He was one of the few
		  members from his part of the State who voted for the Constitutional Convention
		  of 1835 as an act of justice to the Western Counties, which they always
		  remembered with gratitude. In 1848 and from 1852 to 1868 he was a Judge of the
		  Supreme Court.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p550" n="550"/>
          <p>While at his Court Judge Battle had as his assistant in the Law School
		  Samuel F. Phillips, who after a distinguished career as a lawyer, member of the
		  House of Commons, Commissioner of Claims against the State, and Auditor, held
		  during the administration of Grant, Hayes, Garfield and Arthur, the high office
		  of Solicitor General of the United States.</p>
          <p>The Tutors were Ralph Henry Graves, father of the Professor R. H.
		  Graves of a later date, in charge of Mathematics and Wm. H. Owen of Languages.
		  Graves filled his chair ably and, when he went off to take charge of classical
		  schools, at first alone, afterward in conjunction with James H. Horner, much
		  regret prevailed among Faculty and students. Owen was of lighter calibre, but
		  equal to his duties. He had a habit of using great words, which gave much
		  amusement. Here is a specimen of one of his reports, if we may credit the
		  students. “I was aroused from my slumber by the untimely ringing of the
		  bell and forthwith vigorously pursued the perpetrator in cloudy and moonless
		  darkness. Suddenly with painful violence I struck my pedal extremity on an
		  excressence of a gigantic oak and fell supine on my mother earth.” He was
		  a good man, however, and fully deserved his elevation to a Professorship in
		  Wake Forest College. It was his uncommon dignity of manner which gave him the
		  College name of “Judge” Owen.</p>
          <p>Tutor Graves was succeeded by a man whose brain well corresponded to
		  his huge frame of 230 pounds, Charles Phillips, son of Professor James
		  Phillips, a first honor graduate of 1841. After spending some time in Princeton
		  Theological Seminary he became Tutor of Mathematics in our University in 1844.
		  He loved hard work and soon acquired the reputation of being the first of the
		  young mathematicians of the South. He published a text-book on Trigonometry,
		  which showed a firm grasp of the subject, and was highly regarded by scholars.
		  The eminent preacher and College President, Rev. Dr. J. H. Thornwell said of
		  him, “where have you been hiding this man Phillips? Why, sir, he has a
		  brain as big as his abdomen!” He, however, declined being a specialist,
		  and devoted much time to preaching and the study of theology, and after some
		  years to Political Economy. He was very active 
		  <figure><graphic xml:id="ill15" url="bat1-550.jpg"/><p>CHARLES PHILLIPS.</p><p>RALPH H. GRAVES, SR.</p><p>JOHN KIMBERLY.</p></figure><pb xml:id="p551" n="551"/>in enforcing discipline of the
		  institution, and sometimes temporarily lost popularity by his zeal. But his
		  untiring unselfishness in helping those who asked his aid, spending hours often
		  in explaining difficult questions out of recitation hours, his open-handed
		  charity, his skill as a teacher and his deserved reputation for intellectual
		  ability, always won the respect of all, and the affection of most of the
		  students. His college name was “Fatty,” which he accepted with good
		  humor. A French merchant in Fayetteville, seeing him panting after a hot walk,
		  earnestly inquired, “Fat is de mattaire?” “That is it,”
		  said Tutor Phillips, “you have it exactly. Fat <hi rend="italics">is</hi>
		  the matter.” It was one of his characteristics that he scorned to take
		  care of his bodily health. He would rise from a hasty dinner and at once lead
		  an engineering class in practical exercise in the field in the hottest weather,
		  on one occasion eleven miles to University Station and back in one afternoon.
		  He has been known to spend the whole of the last night of Commencement, after
		  attending all the exercises and all the duties of hospitality, in preparing for
		  the press the story of the happenings of the week. Once, after burying a member
		  of his church, he became drenched with a wintry rain on his return and
		  conducted a recitation for an hour without changing his clothes. The result of
		  this indiscretion was that he lingered for days between life and death.</p>
          <p>In consequence of this neglect of the laws of health he was soon
		  grievously afflicted with gout, which pursued him from time to time to the end
		  of his days. He was thoroughly unselfish and desirous of doing his duty, and
		  much more. In the class room he was a luminous teacher. His aim was to inspire
		  the desire of learning more than the lesson assigned. His instruction was of
		  chief advantage to the best scholars. At this period he was admittedly one of
		  the ablest teachers in the University. In after life he often shot above the
		  heads of his pupils and the best students complained of being made to appear as
		  if they were ignorant, while the less diligent were hopelessly lost. He
		  contended that by this method the pupils were aroused to aspire to higher
		  things.</p>
          <p>The mathematical text-books used at this period were those of
		  Professor Benjamin Peirce, which the average student <pb xml:id="p552" n="552"/>
		  thought to be “hard” and uninteresting. After awhile it was
		  ascertained that the edition of Calculus was exhausted. So a secret committee
		  of students raided every room in the University, and collected all the
		  obnoxious volumes. A fire was kindled and soon the dark places of those books
		  became light. Church and Loomis superseded Peirce on Calculus and Analytical
		  Geometry and proved to be more easily understood. Trigonometry, by Professor
		  Charles Phillips, was also used and highly steemed.</p>
          <p>Mr. Phillips was Secretary of the Faculty and had charge of the
		  preparation of schedules and other University papers. Indeed, he was so fond of
		  work that he induced his father to turn over to him the lectures and
		  Experiments in Natural Philosophy. He repaired and polished up the dust-covered
		  instruments bought by Dr. Caldwell in 1824, and proved to be a brilliant
		  experimenter. Many regretted that he did not refrain from journeys into other
		  fields and gain for the University the honor of having among its Alumni a man
		  acknowledged to be one of the greatest mathematicians of America.</p>
          <p>The Tutor of Ancient Languages, Ashbel Green Brown, elected in 1844, a
		  graduate with second honor in the class of 1843, was an excellent teacher of
		  the construction of sentences, the tenses and conjugations and declinations of
		  words, but like Professor Fetter, gave little idea of the beauty of classical
		  literature. He was a serious man, devoid of humor, a good disciplinarian. He
		  was of abnormal nervous sensitiveness, which grew on him as time wore on and
		  became so severe that after a few years he was given a vacation for a year, and
		  as he did not recover, he thought best to resign in 1855.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE CURRICULUM EXERCISES</head>
          <p>were chiefly Latin, Greek and Mathematics. Chemistry, Geology,
		  Mineralogy, Botany, Zoology, occupied only three hours a week for nine months;
		  Methaphysics, Political Economy, Constitutional and International Law occupied
		  the same time. Even after the inauguration of the School of Engineering and
		  Agricultural Chemistry more than one-third of the student's time was spent in
		  the Dead Languages; one-half in the Languages, Ancient and Modern; three-fifths
		  in Languages <pb xml:id="p553" n="553"/>and Pure Mathematics; only one-fifth in
		  Physics; in Mental Philosophy, Logic and Rhetoric only one-twentieth; and in
		  Political Science, Law, Psychology and Rhetoric, all combined, only one-eighth
		  of the time of four years. The English studies were assigned to the department
		  of Metaphysics and allowed three hours a week for one year. In that time were
		  attempted to be taught Logic, Psychology, Rhetoric, and the English Language
		  and Literature. This is a brief statement of the curriculum for the twelve
		  years of the period beginning with June, 1856. Prior to 1856 the proportion of
		  Latin, Greek and Pure Mathematics was much greater.</p>
          <p>No laboratory work was required before 1854, but the Professors of
		  Chemistry and Natural Philosophy (Physics) performed experiments in presence of
		  the classes. The Geology and Surveying students were once or twice a year taken
		  out on excursions into the field to receive practical instruction. The teaching
		  was generally quite thorough, but theoretical in its character. Much attention
		  was paid to pure Mathematics, less to its application. In the classics there
		  was no instruction in Latin and Greek composition, but there was required a
		  minute acquaintance with the grammar and dictionary. The effect was to make
		  these languages disagreeable to the average student. Recitations were
		  exceedingly tedious and consequently disorder was common in more than one of
		  the rooms.</p>
          <p>The impression on the mind of the student was that the chief object of
		  the Professors was to ascertain whether they had learned the lessons assigned.
		  The rule was to mark the value of the answers as soon as the catechising ceased
		  and the average of these showed the standing. There were seven grades,
		  “very good,” “good,” “very respectable,”
		  “respectable,” “tolerable,” “bad” and
		  “very bad.” Those who obtained “very good” in all, or
		  nearly all, their studies, had the first distinction. Those who averaged
		  “good” obtained the second distinction. The “very
		  respectable” had the third distinction. The students, however, classed
		  these as 1st, 2nd and 3rd “might” men. I have been unable to
		  discover any institution where the word “might” was used in the
		  sense prevalent at Chapel Hill. It was usually spelt mite, but I think that the
		  other is probably correct.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p554" n="554"/>
          <p>The examinations counted hardly more than single recitations.
		  Sometimes they were oral, sometimes in writing, lasting one hour or an hour and
		  a half. Occasionally some were held on Tuesday of Commencement week, in
		  presence of Trustees, an ordeal quite formidable.</p>
          <p>Diplomas were easily gained. They were, in fact, nothing else than
		  certificates of behaviour and attendance on the University exercises. The
		  distinctions showed the proficiency obtained in the year's work. In the class
		  of 1844 one student obtained his degree of A. B. whose grades in the Senior
		  year were “very bad” in Latin, “tolerable” in Chemistry
		  and in Constitutional Law. Another equally fortunate was “bad” in
		  one study, “tolerable” in two, and “respectable” in the
		  fourth. Nor was the man “very bad” in Latin passed through because
		  of his orderly behavior. It is recorded that during his Senior year he was
		  absent from prayers 227 times, from recitation 137, and from church 19 times,
		  while there were charged against him 44 demerits. The Faculty Journal shows
		  that a special committee of two Professors were requested to call on him, about
		  three months before graduating day, and warn him that his absences from duty
		  were jeopardizing his chances of obtaining a diploma. It seems not to have been
		  necessary to hint to him that the “very bad” standing in Latin
		  should be improved.</p>
          <p>The distinctions awarded were read out publicly and published in the
		  newspapers. Those who obtained them did faithful work. While the minimum
		  standard of scholarship needed for obtaining a diploma was lower than at
		  present, the honor men studied as hard and as successfully as those in similar
		  ranks today.</p>
          <p>The chambers in which instruction was given were called Recitation
		  Rooms. Person Hall, or the Old Chapel, was in 1842 divided by thick walls and
		  large chimneys, so as to make four of these, one to the Latin, one to the
		  Greek, one to the Rhetoric Professor, and one to the Tutor of Ancient
		  Languages. The Tutor of Mathematics had two rooms with partitions removed on
		  the second floor of the Old East, North end, possessing a tragic reminiscence
		  from the futile efforts of <pb xml:id="p555" n="555"/>an insane student to hang
		  himself therein. The other recitation rooms were in the South building. That
		  used by Governor Swain and that by Dr. Phillips, both on the second floor, had
		  the ambitious names of the University Library and the Philosophical Chamber,
		  respectively, while that by Dr. Mitchell on the first floor, originally
		  designed for a Chapel, was called “the Laboratory.” When the
		  Dialectic and Philanthropic halls on the third floor were vacated in 1848 they
		  were used for class purposes. When the members increased so greatly afterward
		  other apartments were brought into use.</p>
          <p>The Seniors of those days were specially privileged and as a
		  consequence were expected to show superior dignity and manliness of conduct.
		  They were exempt from attending the most odious recitation, that before
		  breakfast, so that they had one-third less attendance on lectures than the
		  others. This was in accordance with President Swain's policy of dignifying this
		  class. His maxim was “as is the Senior class so is the University.”
		  They were presumed to be improving their minds by reading and writing. To them
		  was given a month's holiday anterior to Commencement. This was preceded by
		  “Senior Speaking,” original orations being delivered in the
		  “New Chapel,” i. e., Gerrard Hall, before the public. A student
		  band, generally two violins and a flute or two, furnished the music, which was
		  uncommonly sweet and enlivening. Richard, or “Dick,” Weaver was a
		  noted flute player. The orations were of the usual dignity and solemnity, but
		  there was always what was called a “Funny.” In 1844 Long was the
		  comical man. I recall only one passage. He began,</p>
          <lg type="poem">
            <l>“You'd scarce expect one of my size</l>
            <l>Before the public gaze to rise!</l>
            <l>And if I shall chance to fall below,</l>
            <l>Horner high and Duncan low,</l>
            <l>Don't view me with a critic's eye</l>
            <l>But pass my imperfections by.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>As Horner (James H.) was about six and a half feet in height, and
		  “Duncan,” i. e., Alexander Duncan Moore, though very active and
		  strong for his inches, was only about five feet two, the students rewarded the
		  hit by kicking the uncarpeted <pb xml:id="p556" n="556"/>floor with resounding
		  heels, making a noise which echoed from McCauley's Mill to Piney Prospect. They
		  were allowed to use their heels <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">ad
		  libitum</foreign>,</hi>but not to applaud with canes.</p>
          <p>The speeches were submitted to the censorship of the Professor of
		  Rhetoric. How the following gorgeous metaphor escaped the knife of Dr. Wheat in
		  1851 is certainly strange. A Senior wound up a glowing description of the
		  future greatness of the United States with this prediction, “And the
		  Angel of Liberty will plant one foot on the Alleghanies and the other upon the
		  Rocky Mountains and spread her white skirt over all this broad land!”
		  This was paralleled by a Missionary, who visited Chapel Hill in the interest of
		  his mission and was invited to preach in Gerrard Hall. He was portraying the
		  sublimity and terror of the Last Day of Judgment. His closing was, “And
		  the avenging Angel will plant one foot on the Ganges”—Dr. Mitchell
		  said that he expected, of course, that the other foot would be on the
		  Mississippi or the Amazon—but no, “one foot on the Ganges and the
		  other on the Georgium Sidus!” The Georgium Sidus or Uranus was then
		  thought to be the outermost planet.</p>
          <p>These exercises were attended by the ladies and gentlemen of the
		  village. Perfect decorum was observed. The speakers wore black silk gowns,
		  belonging to the two Societies. No manuscripts nor prompting were allowed. If
		  memory failed the unfortunate Senior took his seat and his eloquence was lost
		  to the world, a tragic ending as painful to the sympathetic audience as to the
		  victim. To avoid this peril the halls and forests around for weeks previously
		  resounded with oratory.</p>
          <p>Long speeches were <choice><sic>taboed</sic><corr>tabooed</corr></choice>, eight minutes
		  being the limit. Allusions to politics, to differences between religious
		  denominations, all advocacy of the Higher Criticism of the Bible, and any
		  doctrines offensive to average orthodoxy, especially all ridicule or censure of
		  the Faculty, were rigorously excluded. Notwithstanding this handicapping there
		  were many speeches of marked excellence. I recall particularly those of Wm. K.
		  Blake, M. W. Ransom, Victor C. Barringer, W. A. Jenkins, and Seaton Gales. Some
		  were allowed to be repeated at Commencement, but generally new orations were
		  prepared.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p557" n="557"/>
          <p>At Commencement the prize oration, the Valedictory, was sometimes a
		  short address at the end of an oration on another subject. Usually, however, it
		  was a genuine farewell to Faculty, students and classmates, and sometimes
		  Trustees, full of tender reminiscences, or regret of separation, of educational
		  advantages realized, of wise counsel for the future. According to the
		  temperament of the speaker, some of these orations were very touching and were
		  listened to with more interest than all the others. The Faculties of the
		  present day think that such speeches are beneath the dignity of Universities,
		  but the old-time Faculties saw no triviality in a student, at the close of his
		  labors, and entering on manhood's work, speaking to his fellows words of
		  affection, of gratitude, of warning, of encouragement, of hope and lofty
		  purpose.</p>
          <p>The Latin Salutatory was regarded as the second prize. It was listened
		  to with interest, although understood by few. There were certain catch phrases
		  always recognized and vehemently applauded. The most common was
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">formosissimae puellae Septentrionalis
		  Carolinae</foreign>.</hi>The other speeches were by the honor men—each
		  being required as a rule to perform his duty. Occasionally a non-honor man of
		  superior repute as an orator was allowed by consent to take the place of a
		  kindly friend willing to avoid the trouble and forego the glory of appearing on
		  the stage. When the number of students largely increased only the first and
		  second distinction men were awarded speeches. Occasionally, not often, a
		  Salutatory in English was given to one possessed of extraordinary powers as a
		  speaker, as in the case of Matt W. Ransom.</p>
          <p>There was much interest in the Freshman Declamation on Monday night of
		  Commencement week, and those of the Sophomores on Tuesday night. The speakers
		  wore black gowns, the property of the two Societies, which disappeared at the
		  time of the occupancy of the Federal soldiers. Pinned on the lapels of the
		  gowns were blue and white ribbons, the society colors. While there was much
		  commonplace in the speeches there was much of great excellence. I recall
		  particularly those of Wm. Henry Manly and Alonzo T. Manning as meeting
		  universal commendation. The importance given <pb xml:id="p558" n="558"/>the
		  declamation, although considered by some as below University dignity, certainly
		  was a valuable aid to the polishing of orators.</p>
          <p>After the Sophomore declamations the Societies held secret meetings,
		  during which honorary members were admitted. Questions were discussed by four
		  Juniors elected by the Societies, who were called “Debaters.” These
		  studied the questions with great care and many of them delivered speeches of
		  conspicuous merit. The election was considered as an honor much to be desired.
		  They had the peculiar privilege of free access to the Society libraries at all
		  hours, and their orations were filed in the Archives.</p>
          <p>Declamations were required of all students, except Seniors, in the
		  Chapel after evening prayers, formerly before Faculty and students; at this
		  time only before the Faculty. Webster's peroration in his reply to Hayne,
		  Emmett's defence on trial for treason, and Charles Phillips' turgid eulogium of
		  Napolean, beginning “Grand, gloomy and peculiar he sat on the throne,
		  wrapped in the solitude of his own originality,” were looked on as the
		  perfection of oratory. Poetry was seldom chosen. Occasionally, however, one of
		  dramatic instincts and manner would attempt an extract from a great tragedy and
		  procure boundless applause. I think John T. Taylor, of Oxford, excelled in this
		  line. Theophilus Terry, of Texas, produced a thrilling effect without a
		  gesture, solely by the appropriate intonations of his voice.</p>
          <p>“Deviling” certain Professors, whose defective powers of
		  command made them targets for such treatment was, as I have explained, because
		  of the school boy mode of discipline, led to resentments toward the Faculty.
		  Among other arbitrary rules the members of the class were required to sit in
		  alphabetical order, to sit upright on benches, whose backs were of rigid
		  perpendicularity, to stand in most departments in front of the Professors while
		  reciting. All books, except classical books, were forbidden to be taken into
		  the recitation rooms. All students were compelled to attend prayers every day
		  long before sunrise in winter, and near sunrise at other seasons, and each
		  afternoon, except Saturdays. Compulsory attendance on divine worship in the
		  Chapel on Sundays at 11 o'clock a. m., <pb xml:id="p559" n="559"/>was insisted on,
		  even in bitter cold weather without fires. The classes must all sit together,
		  and the roll was called by a Tutor beginning with the Seniors in alphabetical
		  order, then with the Juniors, and so on. The President sat on the rostrum with
		  the officiating minister at evening prayers, the other members of the Faculty
		  being located so as to enclose the “student body” with a cordon of
		  detectives. Absences were carefully noted and delinquents often offending were
		  called up for reprimands and even subjected to deprivation of diplomas.
		  Napoleon Daniel, A.B., 1846, was notified that his cup of grace was run over.
		  He determined to be on hand. He carried into the Chapel at bed time a blanket
		  and spread himself for sleep on a rear bench. The backs of the benches were
		  high and he was unobserved. When he awoke the sun was high in the heavens and
		  the worshippers had dispersed.</p>
          <p>In the afternoons of Sundays there was compulsory Bible class,
		  excepting that the Seniors exchanged the Bible for Wayland's Moral Science. As
		  answers were required to be substantially in the words and order of the book,
		  this last was a difficult study.</p>
          <p>There were no recitations before breakfast on Saturdays and Sundays,
		  and consequently students could, after attending prayers, sleep until breakfast
		  hour. On those mornings particularly the spectacle was by no means edifying.
		  Numbers would rush into the Chapel, with faces unwashed and hair uncombed, clad
		  only in chamber wrappers, great coats, or counterpanes, and as soon as the
		  longed for Amen was pronounced, hurry back to bed.</p>
          <p>The following doggerel, slightly altered, written concerning the
		  morning exercises at Harvard, is an exact description of the similar
		  experiences at Chapel Hill.</p>

          <head>THE DISCIPLINE.</head>
          <p>Even as late as this period the discipline was so harsh as to lead to
		  hostile feelings and to greater disorder than it prevented. The crashing of
		  stones through a Tutor's window was not then fashionable. But knowing that some
		  of the Faculty would leave their warm beds and engage in a race after the
		  offenders it was piquant fun to ring the bell, which was in a belfry near the
		  well, shout, fire pistols and make other like noises. If caught the offenders
		  were probably suspended, or in their own language “rusticated” for
		  two or three weeks. Sometimes, I grieve to say, there would be bad corn whiskey
		  which would incite to worse actions. The superior temperance of the students of
		  today is a source of pride and joy to all who love the University and feel a
		  kindly interest in young men.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p561" n="561"/>
          <p>The feeling of irritation on the part of students was not
		  universal.</p>
          <p>Most of them obeyed the laws with true Anglo-Norman loyalty. Warm
		  feeling of friendship sprang up between them and their able and kindly
		  instructors. The Faculty were hardly responsible for the rules. These were
		  probably similar to the rules in all other institutions. They were the fashion
		  of the age. They descended from old times. But they were productive of serious
		  evils, and when the University was revived in 1875, they were allowed to lie
		  dormant forever. The students have responded nobly to the change of policy to
		  the “great and endless comfort” of all the members of the
		  University.</p>
          <p>Demerit marks were imposed for many minor breaches of the regulations.
		  If the Professor or Tutor thought an offense too great to be punished by a
		  demerit mark, the sinner was ordered to appear before the Faculty. I give the
		  number of delinquencies for which offenders were summoned in 1850-51, before
		  the Faculty for punishment, reprimand, notification to parents, suspension or
		  dismissal during one year. For talking and other misbehavior at Prayers there
		  were 68; for misbehavior at recitation rooms there were 114, of which 67 were
		  to annoy Professor Fetter and 18 to annoy Tutor Brown. For tardiness at
		  recitations there were 26; not making up omitted recitations 7; 10 were up for
		  riotous conduct at night; 14 for being out of their rooms while the riots were
		  in progress, and 3 for riding horses in the Campus, one of whom shocked the
		  Faculty by forcing his steed through the West building; 3 were up for shooting
		  a pistol in the woods South of the Campus, and 1 for not sending away his dog;
		  4 were called before the Faculty for fighting, of whom one frankly confessed
		  that he was in the wrong and apologized, and another was forced by the Faculty
		  to do likewise; 7 were up for general impropriety of conduct, and 8 for
		  drunkenness. All of the last were suspended or dismissed.</p>
          <p>The prohibition against having dogs and guns was gradually relaxed on
		  condition that the dogs should not be kept near the <pb xml:id="p562" n="562"/>
		  University buildings. Only one student brought a horse or horses for personal
		  use. Colonel W. H. S. Burgwyn had a pair, which he used for visiting relatives
		  in Hillsboro. President Swain suggested to him that his example might encourage
		  similar expense by those unable to afford it. He readily sent them home.</p>
          <p>When the punishment of suspension was inflicted the offender usually
		  spent his period of “rustication” at the home of a substantial
		  citizen, father of our present Bursar, on New Hope Creek. The penalty of
		  passing on the studies pursued by his class during his absence was more or less
		  strictly enforced.</p>
          <p>One Tutor was required to reside in the East, the other in the West
		  building, in the second stories, both looking toward the well in the
		  quadrangle. All classes recited at the same hours, the first before breakfast,
		  the second at eleven o'clock a. m., the third at four o'clock in winter and
		  five in summer. From the afternoon recitations all proceeded to the Chapel for
		  Prayers. “Study hours” were from nine to twelve, and two to five in
		  the afternoon in one term, and from eight to twelve, and three to six in the
		  other. Then in one term at eight o'clock at night, in the other at nine
		  o'clock, the notice bell was rung and the students were supposed to be in their
		  rooms engaged in study or sleep. It was a breach of the rules, for which they
		  were liable to be called to account, to visit the village, engage in any game,
		  or sit on the steps during study hours, or sleep hours. A standing joke was,
		  when the Freshmen were green and tender, for an idle upper class man, usually a
		  Soph, to watch for the appearance of one in the area between the buildings,
		  East, South and West, and shout “Fresh in the Campus,” whereupon
		  almost every window facing this area would be thrown up, and numerous yelling
		  throats would take up the chorus. It was trying to the nerves, as I well
		  recollect. After the Fresh joke became stale, any unusual appearance, except
		  ladies, who were gazed on in courteous silence, was greeted by similar
		  shouts.</p>
          <p>President Swain once became so annoyed at the shouting from doors and
		  windows that he announced from the rostrum that the next offender would be
		  dismissed. Coming down stairs from his room in the East building a Tutor came
		  upon <pb xml:id="p563" n="563"/>a knot of students sitting on the steps, one of
		  whom, a large raw-boned Scotch Highlander from the Cape Fear country, was
		  bawling Fresh! Fresh! at the top of his voice. The Tutor tapped him on the
		  shoulder, saying, “Don't bawl so loudly! I might hear you and have you
		  sent off.” There was a merciless laugh by the other students at his
		  discomfiture. The case was not reported as the officer knew that the
		  President's threat was <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">in
		  terrorem</foreign></hi>only.</p>
          <p>Cheating on examination when the object was only to pass and not to
		  get an honor was not considered dishonorable. It was a trial of wit between the
		  class and the Professor, and it was considered good fun to win. One of the most
		  ingenious plans was to cut a hole in the floor of the recitation room in an
		  upper story under the benches, then to lower the questions by a string, and
		  haul up the answers worked out by a number of good scholars underneath. These
		  were then distributed. This was called “working the telegraph.” A
		  Tutor of Mathematics exhorted the boys to study, telling them that he knew all
		  about their telegraph. Great was his chagrin to discover afterward by accident
		  that they had already prepared to play a similar trick on him through a wood
		  closet in rear of the benches underneath a similar closet on the floor above,
		  the answers being lowered to the eager hand. Another plan was to obtain a copy
		  of the printed questions in advance from the printing office in Raleigh.
		  Sometimes a rapid worker, after finishing his task would ask for a plug of
		  tobacco and the lender, when it was returned, would find answers hid in its
		  recesses. Sometimes a paper containing questions would be thrown from a window
		  and the solution wrapped around a pebble would be returned through the same
		  opening. Once a selfish boy, J—, well up in his studies, was working away
		  on his solutions, the first two or three of which were easy. His neighbor,
		  C—, in trepidation begged earnestly for one. “Don't bother
		  me,” said J—, “I want to do them all.” He soon,
		  however, “struck a snag,” and became demoralized. In the meantime
		  C— had shot the questions out of the window and received several
		  solutions from a watchful upper classman. “C—,” said
		  J—, in terror, “let me have one of your solutions.”
		  “Don't bother me,” said C—, copying <pb xml:id="p564" n="564"/>
		  industriously, “I want to do them all.” He took care, however, to
		  solve only as many as his class standing made reasonable. It was as dangerous
		  to do too much as too little.</p>
          <p>The heated excitement of the Log-cabin and Hard-cider campaign of 1840
		  reached the secluded groves of Chapel Hill. I find that the Faculty, fearing
		  trouble, made a formal request of the county candidates not to speak at Chapel
		  Hill, a request probably not granted. And when three of the students were
		  chosen to be managers of a Whig dinner, which was to be given in the village,
		  they were peremptorily forbidden to accept the honor. Nearly all of the Faculty
		  were Whigs, but it was the settled policy of President Swain to keep the
		  University out of politics. The deviation in this policy in the first years
		  after the war by some of the Professors led to disaster in 1868 as we shall
		  see.</p>
          <p>It was impossible, however, to keep down party enthusiasm among the
		  students. There was considerable electioneering by them, and the Democrats were
		  greatly elated when the Whigs clubbed together to buy fifty acres for
		  “old blind Pendergrass,” to enable him to vote for their candidate
		  for the Senate, and he traitorously put in his ballot for the Democrat.</p>
          <p>The anxiety of the Faculty about these gatherings was not alone that
		  the University might get the hostility of one of the parties. Corn whiskey was
		  abundant in almost every covered wagon; the bullies of the county early in the
		  day were loaded with this maddening stuff and there was considerable danger of
		  collision. The Faculty and cooler portions of the students managed to keep the
		  peace. There was pointed out to me a giant of a man, said to have been
		  regularly hired to protect the college boys from hostile engagements. Though
		  there were occasional angry words, there were no blows. Those fond of
		  gladitorial contests were content to witness the fights between the country
		  people. Of these there were seldom less than four or five. I recall a fisticuff
		  between a town and country boy, about fifteen years old each. The former was
		  clearly in the wrong, yet all boys in Chapel Hill ranged themselves on the side
		  of the wrongdoer and proclaimed their thirst for the gore of his adversary and
		  every rustic siding with him. It was analogous to the old Oxford “Town
		  and Gown” rivalry <pb xml:id="p565" n="565"/>on a small scale, but peace
		  prevailed. The elders interfered. I saw the leader of the town belligerants,
		  ignominiously spanked by his elder brother. Enthusiasm could not be sustained
		  for a spanked hero. The country boys did not accept the gage of battle. The
		  town boys threw their clubs into ditches.</p>
          <p>The abstention from political discussion was, however, not so rigorous
		  as to prevent the Faculty giving a half holiday in order that the students
		  might hear the speeches of Romulus M. Saunders and Henry W. Miller, candidates
		  for Congress. This was probably for their improvement in oratory. Saunders,
		  although a ruthless murderer of “the King's English,” was a strong
		  stump speaker, and the Whig, Miller, who answered him, was famous as an orator.
		  As an example of the pronunciation prevalent near the Virginia line I give a
		  colloquy between Saunders and Morehead, when candidates for the Governorship,
		  “Whar?” said Saunders, “did the gentleman get his authority
		  for that thar assertion? I ask him whar?” “Thar!” said
		  Morehead, “thar, sir! in them thar dockyments!” Both knew better,
		  but thought it politic to imitate the idiom of their hearers. Miller always
		  used polished language.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE TWO SOCIETIES.</head>
          <p>Until 1848 the two Societies held their meetings in their library
		  rooms, which were in the third story of the South building, the Dialectic
		  occupying the central hall on the South, the Philanthropic being opposite.
		  These halls were considered attractive. The students were proud to show them.
		  The books, the portraits of eminent members, and the chairs for the members in
		  session were all in the same room. Conversations with ladies, after
		  introductions, were not on the hackneyed theme of the past or prospective state
		  of the weather.</p>
          <p>The first question was, “Is this your first visit to the
		  Hill?” The second was, “Have you visited the Halls?” The
		  third, “Are you a Di or a Phi?” It was then fair sailing. If the
		  lady claimed to be of a different society from the questioner, a mock quarrel
		  followed; if of the same a sweet bond of sympathy was established. From these
		  beginnings there ensued hundreds of pleasant acquaintances and many ardent
		  loves. <pb xml:id="p566" n="566"/>Commencements were famous for making matches.
		  This was aided by the non-accessibility of Chapel Hill by railroad or water.
		  Scores of gentlemen and ladies came in carriages and buggies drawn by noble
		  trotters. These were extensively used in the intervals of the exercises for
		  flirtation purposes. They led often to life-long unions.</p>
          <p>The order and decorum of the meetings of the two Societies were worthy
		  of all praise. Not only was parliamentary law learned, but the power of
		  extempore speaking and writing compositions, as well as gracefulness in
		  delivery were acquired. The members were proud of their society and afraid of
		  its censure. The habit of self-government, of using their own liberty so as not
		  to interfere with the liberties of others, was inculcated. Many young men who
		  neglected text-books obtained here a valuable education, while those who were
		  candidates for offices learned here what they could not learn in the class
		  room—how to manage men. Indeed, men who attained distinction in after
		  life as Senators, Governors, Judges, and the like, have been known to date
		  their beginning of success from their forensic exercises in the Society Halls.
		  The chief debaters studied their subjects well and argued them with intelligent
		  zeal and often eloquence. Of course these questions were generally those
		  discussed in Congress, in the journals, and on the hustings, but sometimes the
		  time-honored historical disputes about the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots;
		  whether the career of Cromwell was beneficial to England, whether the
		  civilization of Greece or Rome was most beneficial to the world, whether the
		  United States was bound by treaty to aid France in her Revolutionary wars, and
		  the like, were fought over again.</p>
          <p>Of course, among a number of members of verdant hue, there were
		  ludicrous sayings. For example, a Freshman, who had undoubted talent, though
		  untrained, denounced the argument of his opponent as a “tissue of
		  unintel-ligible jar-goon.” When he saw that he had caused merriment, he
		  explained, “I know there is some tautology in the expression, but it is
		  true.” He rose to be a very successful jury lawyer. Another, now a most
		  reputable physician, whose duty it was to prosecute Warren Hastings for his
		  conduct in India, contended that it was <pb xml:id="p567" n="567"/>“atrocious
		  robbery in him to despoil the Princesses of Oude of their <hi rend="italics">bee-hives</hi>(Begums). But such mistakes were rare.</p>
          <p>It was praiseworthy that the President and other officers were voted
		  for, not on account of personal popularity, but for the substantial reason of
		  attention to Society duties and attaining high marks in the class room. The
		  members, too, listened with interest to the written theses, or compositions
		  which were read on each alternate Saturday, and one deemed of sufficient
		  excellence was on motion, by a vote of the members, filed in the archives. I
		  recall that those of Dr. Theodore Kingsbury were repeatedly so honored. The
		  Presidents were required to deliver inaugural addresses, which were bound in
		  books and preserved in the archives, as a matter of course.</p>
          <p>The relations between the Societies were, as a rule, harmonious. Once
		  there was danger when two leaders had a fight in front of the Chapel and the
		  “Dis” supposed that two or three “Phis” were helping
		  their member. It was soon found that they were parting the combatants and
		  hostile feelings vanished. Once when the <hi rend="italics">sarcoptes
		  scabei</hi>had affected certain individuals of both societies, so that the
		  authorities quarantined them at Craig's, a farm house a mile from the town, in
		  sulphurous loneliness, the other students were merry over the incident.
		  “Phis” posted handbills warning all to avoid the dormitories
		  inhabited by “Dis.” I heard an eloquent speech from a
		  “Di” on the enormity of thus displaying “black-guards,”
		  as he called placards. The “Dis” retaliated by inventing a story
		  that the “Phis” had a scratching post in their Society Hall; that a
		  member was overheard to say, “Mr. President! may I scratch?”
		  “No, sir!” was the reply, “not at present, Mr. Koontz has the
		  post.”</p>
          <p>There was much emulation at Commencement. The “Di” color,
		  blue, was worn by the Marshals, Ball Managers and Speakers of that Society,
		  while the Representatives of the other Society wore white. Emulation was shown
		  in inducing distinguished visitors to become honorary members. Committees were
		  appointed to wait on them. The Eastern and Western dividing line was not
		  recognized until after about 1850, so that there was great zeal, sometimes
		  leading to bad feelings, in procuring recruits from the new members. Old
		  <pb xml:id="p568" n="568"/>students sometimes rode miles into the country to meet
		  the incoming Freshmen. This electioneering, although bad, was not an unmixed
		  evil. It often led to protection from hazing.</p>
          <p>As such books as they desired were not purchased for the University
		  Library, the two Societies levied a tax for supplying their own needs. Dr.
		  William Hooper, in his “Fifty Years Since,” states, of course with
		  some exaggeration, that in his day, whenever one Society bought a new book, the
		  other duplicated it. This was by no means the case in “the
		  forties,” but there was duplication of most reference books. The two
		  libraries together had probably the best collection in the State. They were not
		  accessible to the public, except for a few hours per week, so that continuous
		  research was impossible. Certain costly works were marked
		  “prohibited,” especially those with engravings placed on tables for
		  the inspection of all comers. All the others could be borrowed for two weeks.
		  Covers of cloth of various sizes were provided, to be fitted on by the
		  borrower, but eventually the practice was discontinued because of injury to the
		  backs of volumes. Fielding, Scott, James, Bulwer, Cooper, Irving and Dickens
		  were the favorite authors. Shakespeare was much read. The “Dis” had
		  quite a collection of antiques and curios, the larger part given by Lieutenant
		  Boudinot, of the Navy, retired, but it has come to nothing.</p>
          <p>If the law against Fraternities was violated, the secret was well
		  kept. Occasionally a few students would associate together in such manner as to
		  incur suspicion.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the Society seemed to have more power than the Faculty. A
		  youth of well-known and honorable family stole ten dollars from his room mate,
		  a poor boy—all he had. He was not prosecuted in the Courts, but of course
		  was dismissed from the University. He met this with brazen effrontery, but when
		  his Literary Society, after a fair trial, convicted and expelled him, his
		  spirit was broken. The piteous appeal of his mother, his only parent, for his
		  restoration, moved every heart, but it was impossible to grant it.</p>
          <p>I witnessed prior to 1849 a trial on impeachment for slander in one of
		  the Societies. The proceedings were as orderly, and as carefully secured to the
		  accused the provisions guaranteed by our Declaration of Rights for a fair
		  trial, as may be seen <pb xml:id="p569" n="569"/>in our Superior Courts. The
		  members of the Society voted <hi rend="italics">viva voce</hi>and there was a
		  large majority for acquittal. Very rarely a course analagous to Lynch law was
		  adopted outside the Societies. When a student perpetrated an act that made him
		  unworthy to associate longer with gentlemen, a number of his fellows would give
		  him notice to leave the institution at once, which order was obeyed. For
		  example one —— slandered a virtuous young lady and was glad to be
		  allowed to depart by the next train. This was deemed better than a formal
		  trial. If he had denied his guilt a trial in his Society would have been
		  promptly held.</p>

          <head>COMMENCEMENTS.</head>
          <p>As the Chief Marshal was elected out of the Junior class by all the
		  students there was generally active electioneering, sometimes lasting for two
		  years or more. One of the most heated contests was between Thomas J. Person of
		  Northhampton, afterward a Militia General of North Carolina, and Bryan Grimes
		  of Pitt, afterward a Major General of the Confederacy. Grimes' chances were
		  ruined by the charge that he was the candidate of the aristocracy, while Person
		  courted the democracy. Occasionally, however, as in the case of William M.
		  Howerton of Virginia, in 1846, and William H. Hall of Wilmington, in 1854, the
		  popularity of the candidate ensured no opposition. As treating to ardent
		  spirits was fashionable everywhere in the country, there was no lack of it
		  here. It was a serious evil. Libations were offered to secure victory and then
		  to celebrate it. Sometimes the quantity furnished was the cause of a general
		  spree. One Marshal, on account of his wealth, natural generosity and
		  determination to win, left the University two thousand dollars in debt. Such
		  results of universal suffrage led to the election of a Junior by the Senior
		  class by order of the Trustees.</p>
          <p>The greatest man at Commencement, except the Governor of the State,
		  the President of the University and the Orator before the two Societies was the
		  Marshal. The selections were, as a rule, excellent. The Marshal was conspicuous
		  for good manners, a handsome person and savoir faire. He selected six
		  assistants, called “Subs,” three from each Society, and took
		  <pb xml:id="p570" n="570"/>pains to make his term successful by having them
		  possessed of qualities similar to his own.</p>
          <p>Part of their duties was to ride out on the Raleigh road to meet and
		  escort the band into the village. Truly it was a gallant sight. All the
		  students and Faculty, and all the village turned out to listen to the music,
		  and to witness one of the noblest spectacles in all the world, graceful young
		  men, skillfully managing spirited horses.</p>
          <p>Another duty of the Marshals, now partially discontinued, from which
		  they probably got their names, was forming and preceding a procession of the
		  men at Commencement to the Chapel. Standing on the steps of the South building
		  the Chief called out sixteen classes, beginning with the Orators of the Day,
		  then the Governor and President of the University, then the Trustees, Faculty
		  and students of the University and so on, ending with the citizens and
		  strangers generally.</p>
          <p>As these were called they were arranged two and two by the
		  “Subs,” along what was then a mere road, now Cameron Avenue, with
		  the head of the column, including high officials, distinguished visitors, and
		  the speakers of the day, toward the West. The Marshal placed the band at the
		  east end, conducted the column in reverse order by the most convenient route
		  around the old Caldwell monument, then a conspicuous object. As the monument
		  was passed, all raised their hats. Arriving at Gerrard Hall a halt was called
		  and the Marshal, leaving the band to play near the door, marched through the
		  column dividing the men right and left, with his gold-headed cane. Through the
		  lane of students and undistinguished visitors he conducted the officials and
		  speakers into the Hall, the rest of the procession falling in behind them,
		  according to the rule of precedence. This imitation of martial pomp was kept up
		  successfully until our people became sickened by the results of the great Civil
		  War. A revival of the procession was attempted in recent years, but after two
		  or three failures they were discontinued. Our people were sick of war and all
		  imitation of war.</p>
          <p>The Chief Ball Manager was likewise elected by all the students and
		  appointed three assistants from each Society. Although they had for dancing
		  only the large dining room of <pb xml:id="p571" n="571"/>the Hotel, and the ball
		  was closed long before daylight, and, notwithstanding cotillons and waltzes and
		  occasional reels were in place of Germans and Lancers, there was as much
		  enjoyment as now, if not more. Pre-engagements for sets, long in advance, were
		  not common. Such a thing as a young lady willing to dance not having an
		  opportunity was never heard of. It was the duty of the managers to supply
		  beauless ladies with partners. Then, as now, however, there was panicky terror
		  at the prospect of being chained to a “wall-flower.”</p>
          <p>The Band was composed of colored men—very much
		  colored—mostly black. The leader was famous, Frank Johnston. They did not
		  play as artistically as the Richmond Band of our day, but they were more
		  enduring and accommodating. Frank's orders to the dancers, “Promenade
		  all.” “Chassez.” “Dos-a-dos.” “Ladies to
		  the Center.” “Turn Corners,” etc., floated into the air a
		  mile from the Ball room.</p>
          <p>An elaborate supper was always provided, usually by the skill of Miss
		  Nancy Hilliard. It was the rule that gentlemen could not go to the “first
		  table,” unless accompanied by a lady. It was not a violation of
		  etiquette, when a Freshman, fourteen years of age, and not tall for his age,
		  walked up to a stout old maid, weighing over two hundred pounds, and obtained
		  her hand to be escorted to the feast. It was certainly a proof of his
		  resourcefulness and pluck, which has led him to the presidency of a great and
		  progressive State institution of learning.</p>
          <p>The Managers, as well as the Marshals, wore very elaborate regalia,
		  usually a broad band of silk ribbon diagonally from shoulder to waist, the
		  “Dis” having blue upon white and the “Phis” the
		  reverse. Sometimes the regalias were streamers of broad ribbon, worn on the
		  left arm. It was the custom then, as now, to donate the regalias to chosen
		  ladies at the close of the Ball, and very proud were the recipients.</p>
          <p>“Commencement Day” being on Thursday, the ball was given
		  that evening. It did not continue all night as now, but only to about three
		  o'clock. There were short dances likewise Tuesday and Wednesday nights after
		  the exercises in the Chapel. The Chapel exercises were usually attended by the
		  dancing ladies. There were no Fraternity or other banquets, so that the Ball
		  began about 9 o'clock. There was no expressed opposition <pb xml:id="p572" n="572"/>
		  to it among the people of the State, doubtless because it came down from the
		  beginning of the University. Tradition is that in old times President Caldwell,
		  a Presbyterian minister, often attended them, and a still more daring tradition
		  asserts that, arrayed in shorts, silk stockings and pumps, he actually danced.
		  I am unable to verify this startling statement and do not credit it. I add that
		  no ladies ever came to Chapel Hill for the sole purpose of dancing, but all
		  made it their duty and pleasure to be present at the exercises and cheer the
		  speakers. Always the behaviour was good, the obedience to the Marshals and
		  Managers being without question.</p>
          <p>There were, of course, notable triumphs among the votaries of
		  Terpsichore. I recall one. Ladies wore low-quarter and heelless slippers. A
		  very vivacious and handsome girl from Warrenton, while waltzing, had one of her
		  slippers to come off. Without stopping she adroitly, on the next round,
		  inserted her <choice><sic>stockined</sic><corr>stockinged</corr></choice>foot into the vacant
		  slipper without losing time in the waltz. The gracefulness with which this feat
		  was accomplished was much admired.</p>
          <p>It would be an endless task to mention all the ladies at our
		  Commencements distinguished for beauty, grace or vivacity. According to my
		  memory Miss Sallie R. Jones, of Hillsboro, was conspicuous for splendid beauty
		  and queenly bearing. We had a German artist, named Weigandt, under the
		  patronage of Rev. Dr. Wheat, who worshipped her at a distance with the devotion
		  shown by Petrarch to Laura. He wrote a poem addressed to “Lady Sallie R.
		  Jones,” whether above mediocrity or not, I have forgotten.</p>
          <p>A student who was leaving the University “under the
		  weather” because he would not attend to his duties, suddenly attained
		  fame by daring conduct which averted almost certain disaster to many. He had
		  taken passage in one of the large four-horse stages. There were nine passengers
		  inside and a number outside going home from Commencement. One of the horses
		  fell, pulling to the ground the driver, who carried the reins with him. The
		  spirited horses made a wild dash down a rocky hill. Our student crept out on
		  the tongue, gathered up the reins and stopped the horses. His praise was in
		  every mouth. His shortcomings in the matters of differential
		  <pb xml:id="p573" n="573"/>co-efficients and Ionic dialects and Juvenal's satires
		  were forgotten. He became a hero.</p>
          <p>The disposition of the students to stand by one another, whether right
		  or wrong, came near leading to a serious affray. The boys were coming up from
		  the direction of Raleigh at the end of a vacation. The popular dinner-house,
		  Moring's (often called Moreen's), was eight miles from Chapel Hill. A Raleigh
		  student inclined to be wild became engaged in an altercation with a passenger
		  on the stage, named Carson. Feeling aggrieved by the result of the quarrel, the
		  student and his friends hurried to their destination and roused up their
		  fellows to meet the stage and punish the adversary. Carson had true pluck. With
		  a pistol in each hand he marched through the angry crowd calmly to his supper.
		  By this time President Swain appeared on the scene and induced the students to
		  retire to their rooms.</p>
          <p>Another incident illustrates this thick and thin comradeship. The
		  University gardener, a powerful Englishman, became angry with a student and
		  struck him. He said that he expected a ring would be formed and they would
		  fight out the dispute according to the rules of the ring. He was surprised,
		  however, to find a number of athletic youths rushing all at once with fire in
		  their eyes to avenge their fellow. Like Hector from Achilles he fled from the
		  danger, the pursuing company increasing in size at every leap. Fortunately
		  President Swain was near enough to quiet the trouble, the gardener tendering an
		  apology which was amicably accepted.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>FACETIAE.</head>
          <p>I give some incidents and sayings, which were the cause of interest or
		  merriment in the past, now become “old times.”</p>
          <p>A practical joke which gave much amusement to bystanders was for an
		  upper classman who combined humor and gravity to be introduced as a member of
		  the Faculty to an applicant for admission into the University who wished to
		  stand an entrance examination. The mystification was sometimes considerably
		  prolonged, until the overawed mind of the greenhorn was brought to realize the
		  truth by the absurdity of the questions.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p574" n="574"/>
          <p>All collections of young men, and possibly girls, have their
		  simpletons of whom absurd stories are told. I give specimens, in some degree
		  true, of the tales told of one in the forties and another of the same name in
		  the fifties. I can not distinguish between the two. He took some friends to a
		  restaurant for a treat. “Burnett! Give me a sixpence worth of vari-egated
		  candy. Dog the expense!” He enquired of a Senior whether
		  “Robespierre was any kin to Shake—.” Showing a lady into a
		  library in which were alcoves, the books being arranged by subjects, he said,
		  “Now, Miss Mary, I will show you the concave of fictionary novels.”
		  In a dry goods store he asked the price of a cake of soap. “Fifteen
		  cents,” said the clerk. “Oh! that is too dear!” “I will
		  sell you two for thirty cents.” “I will take a couple then.”
		  Once in the Library he was surrounded by several large volumes. To a friend he
		  said, “You see I'm literature as the Dickens.”</p>
          <p>There was current the story that one of his letters to his father was
		  found on the campus open, and it ran thus, “Dear Father! Please send me
		  some money. Peas is good but they is 'spensive.” He meant groundpeas, of
		  course.</p>
          <p>A student going into the room of another of the verdant men found his
		  watch on the table. He inserted a tack into the wall next the ceiling and hung
		  the watch thereon, writing underneath <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Tempus fugit</foreign>.</hi>The owner, named Tyler, coming in,
		  after considerable search, espied his property and read the legend. “I
		  know what that is: <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Tempus
		  fugit</foreign></hi>means Tyler's watch.”</p>
          <p>The Tutor of Mathematics once ordered a student of Geometry,
		  “from a point without a line to drop a perpendicular on the line.”
		  The student with his chalk carefully made a mark on the vacant blackboard, and
		  said “Take a dot,” and could go no further. “Well, sir, said
		  the teacher, “where is your line?” The reply was, “You said
		  from a point <hi rend="italics">without</hi>a line.”</p>
          <p>The Tutor gave a problem to Engelhard, a very good mathematician, in
		  which the number of cards in a pack was one of the data. He pretended to be
		  disturbed. Surprised at this, the teacher said, “What is the matter, Mr.
		  Engelhard?” “You have not given me the number of cards. I lack one
		  of the data.” The Tutor said, “Oh! I thought every student in
		  college <pb xml:id="p575" n="575"/>knows there are fifty-two.” The problem
		  was solved, and he afterwards ascertained that the wily Freshman had played a
		  joke on him—that he was considered the best whist player in the
		  University.</p>
          <p>The Tutor called up P. G. and began to give him a problem in
		  Navigation. “Mr. G., a ship sails from Charleston, S. C.” He broke
		  in despairingly, “Mr. B., you might as well stop. I never could do one of
		  them ship sailing sums in my life!”</p>
          <p>A big-mouth Sophomore once caught a Tartar. A shabbily dressed,
		  slouchy country boy was passing near the well. The smart student shouted from
		  his window, ba-a-a! The country boy drawled out, “Yer looks more like a
		  sheep than yer bleats like one!” The discomfiture of his assailant was
		  intensified by the <choice><sic>jerring</sic><corr>jeering</corr></choice>laughter of four score
		  college mates. They are merciless always to the under dog in such a fight. This
		  story is authentic. The late Dr. Richard B. Haywood, of Raleigh, told me that
		  he witnessed the scene.</p>
          <p>The young son of the President, Richard, known as “Little
		  Bunk,” made a reply to a student which was quoted often afterwards. He
		  spoke one day of what “Thad” had done, meaning his cousin, Thaddeus
		  Siler. The student said, “What Thad? Who is Thad?” With great
		  indignation little Bunk burst out, “Don't you know Thad? Everybody knows
		  Thad? Anybody is a fool who don't know Thad!”</p>
          <p>Of course there were occurrences of an amusing nature connected with
		  spirituous and vinous liquors, malt liquors not having then flowed into this
		  inland region. Many stratagems were resorted to in order to secure the coveted
		  stimulant without being detected. A favorite scheme was to hide bottles in
		  boots returned from the shoemakers. It is said that Governor Swain brought from
		  Durham what he thought was a can of kerosene oil, but instead of oil was corn
		  whiskey. Tutor Brown once at night caught a negro with a jug of spirits in the
		  Campus. He promptly arrested him, and haled him to the gate of President Swain.
		  ‘Now, sir! stay here until I turn you over to the President.”
		  Leaving the darkey at the gate, he walked up the avenue and summoned his chief.
		  Great was their disgust, when the twain returned, to find that the liquor man
		  had gone with his liquor, his identity enveloped in the darkness. There
		  <pb xml:id="p576" n="576"/>was great merriment in the University circles, but not
		  in Mr. Brown's presence, for he was a fierce man and could not with impunity be
		  laughed at. He once struck a Professor in retaliation for a sarcasm.</p>
          <p>One afternoon a wagon loaded with peach brandy passed through the
		  village and its owner encamped outside the prohibition zone, then two miles,
		  now four, from the town. A company of students got together and, pooling their
		  funds, called for and obtained two volunteers to purchase and bring in a
		  jugful, while the rest waited impatiently for the coming treat. The volunteers,
		  one afterwards a Governor, trudging over a road deep in wintry mire, with half
		  frozen toes, brought in the prize. Bursting into the room with a triumphant
		  shout, “Boys! we've got it,” the future Chief Executive struck the
		  jug on the floor with miscalculating violence. The treacherous earthenware was
		  shattered and the red brandy sought the cracks of the floor.</p>
          <p>It was on this same floor that Professor Fetter found a tall Sophomore
		  of Scotch Highland lineage seated helpless by the side of a jug emptied of
		  everything except the odor of its recent occupant. With a charming naivete he
		  queried, “Mr. ——, haven't you been drinking?” The reply
		  was with thick-tongued gravity, “Yes, sir, a little.” How much, Mr.
		  ——?” “About a gallon, I reckon.” He was allowed
		  to return, graduated and became eminent in his profession. It was a saying
		  among the students that, when a “Mac” drank whiskey at all, he was
		  “<foreign xml:lang="lat">capacissimus vini</foreign>,” as Tacitus
		  described the Germans.</p>
          <p>Hazing was infrequent and quite mild. “Newies,” who were
		  not Freshmen, were never molested. Sophs would not allow hazing of a member of
		  their class, on the principle that “dog does not eat dog, nor pup eat
		  pups,” and Juniors and Seniors felt it a point of honor to preserve their
		  class-mates from all indignities. The hazing of Fresh was merely
		  “blacking” their faces one time, after which they were considered
		  acclimated. Usually there was no resistance, the victim submitting almost
		  willingly as to a practical joke. A brother of General Evans, of South
		  Carolina, of Leesburg fame, however, prepared in 1853 <pb xml:id="p577" n="577"/>to
		  resist even unto death. With cocked pistol he awaited the assault, led by one
		  McRae, who had all the uncalculating daring of his Highland ancestors. A
		  student knocked up Evans' hand as he pulled the trigger and the ball penetrated
		  the fleshy part of McRae's arm. This led to the discovery of the hazing party.
		  The two Societies offered to stop the practice if the Faculty would not dismiss
		  the offenders. The bargain was made and was very effectual for years. McRae
		  encountered a truer bullet in the great Civil War.</p>
          <p>An amusing exercise of the art of teasing took its place. A number of
		  students would call on a Freshman, dropping in casually as if without concert.
		  Then one would tell an anecdote, followed by others. Finally the Freshman would
		  be beguiled into perpetrating a joke. Instead of laughing, each visitor gazed
		  solemnly and mournfully at the joker, with mouths wide open, loudly
		  ejaculating, HA! The discomfiture of the victim was painfully ludicrous.</p>
          <p>The initiation into the mysteries of the Empire of the Grand Mogul
		  could not be called hazing, as admission was entirely voluntary. The ceremony
		  was in the attic of the South Building, on the stair-case of which was written
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Sic itur ad astra</foreign>.</hi>T. J.
		  Robinson, one of the best students and most courteous gentlemen, was Grand
		  Mogul when his class was Junior, and the office was usually held by good men.
		  There was much fun and frivolity, but no indignity nor cruelty. The
		  self-possession and mother-wit of the novitiate were tested by the questions of
		  the Grand Mogul and his officers. It was admitted that the late Senator Vance,
		  when he joined, discomfitted the questioners by his apt retorts. And no
		  impression was made on the imperturbable coolness and pluck of Senator John
		  Pool, although he was sentenced to be thrown from a window and was suspended
		  over the abyss by sinewy arms.</p>
          <p>A trick played on a Professor at a later date was very dangerous,
		  although intended only for amusement. The Professor's chair was on a hollow box
		  in front of, and fastened to, which was a desk, all rudely made of pine.
		  Shortly before the recitation opened, two youths placed under the box a ball
		  <pb xml:id="p578" n="578"/>of gunpowder to which was attached a time-fuse lighted.
		  When all were assembled the explosion came with unexpected violence. Although
		  the Professor was projected into the middle of the room, no one was injured. W.
		  H. S. Burgwyn, a model student, who had “smelt gunpowder” in actual
		  battle, was earnestly attentive to his French lesson, then being recited. The
		  sudden noise and smoke transported him to a field of battle in Virginia. He
		  leaped to his feet and gave the appropriate order, <hi rend="italics">“Steady, boys! Steady!”</hi></p>
          <p>The guilty youths were so alarmed that they consulted counsel, but
		  their names were never known until they became staid Senators and Trustees of
		  the University.</p>
          <p>A youth from a distant State who lacked neither intellect nor pluck,
		  but was abundantly endowed with greenness, was often made a butt for practical
		  jokes. A mock quarrel was fastened on him. He was challenged to mortal combat
		  at Piney Prospect with pistols. He promptly accepted. A liquid of a red color
		  was provided, and when the innocent weapons were exploded at the word Fire!,
		  his adversary fell. Apparently his shirt front was bathed in blood. The green
		  man showed no agitation but, calmly remarking, “he brought it on
		  himself,” walked back to his room and began to study his lessons. He was
		  teased no more. Respect for his nerve counteracted the disposition to ridicule
		  his verdancy.</p>
          <p>The late genial Francis E. Shober, a popular member of Congress,
		  related with inimitable mimicry his adventure, when during a dark night some of
		  his friends were “out on a lark” and he was trying to protect them
		  from discovery. There was then a five-foot high terrace around the East
		  Building. As he emerged from one of the entrances, he was seized by Tutor
		  Charles Phillips, who was of heavy weight and of ponderous strength. Being
		  strong himself he resisted, and in the struggle they rolled down the terrace.
		  When they reached level ground Shober was at the bottom, Phillips mashing the
		  breath out of him and panting, “Who are you? Who are you?” To avoid
		  suffocation he gasped out, “Francis E. Shober, confound your soul!”
		  Not one of his friends rushed to his rescue, which in the darkness could easily
		  have been effected, but one <pb xml:id="p579" n="579"/>more sympathetic a few score
		  yards off shouted, “Give him ——!” On his trial Shober
		  was saved by the President from dismissal because he had not been drinking, was
		  out of his room from motives of friendship, was not engaged in the disturbance,
		  and had a good character for orderly behaviour. His swearing at the Tutor was
		  excused because the words were forced from him by heavy pressure. Some of the
		  Faculty, however, were displeased at the lenity. Shober to his dying day
		  thought his sympathetic friend was either selfish or showed the white feather.
		  He notwithstanding attained very high position afterwards and often showed
		  conspicuous courage.</p>
          <p>Good humored tricks which boys play on one another often have an
		  educating effect. For example, a green Freshman would be induced to take a sip
		  of wine or other spirits. In a few minutes comments would be made on his
		  appearance. He would be assured that he was tipsy and warned to avoid the
		  Faculty. He would deny the allegation, and, as the politician said, “defy
		  the allegator.” In the midst of the dispute a proposal would be made to
		  leave the question to an umpire. The umpire would avow his inability to decide
		  without the walking-a-crack test. The accused would begin to walk a crack in
		  the floor with confidence, when the umpire would decide against him on the
		  ground that no sober man would ever undertake to do so simple a feat. A boy
		  thus caught would be wary thereafter. I saw General Matt. W. Ransom once act as
		  bogus umpire.</p>
          <p>A favorite joke on the trusting Freshman was snipe-hunting. His
		  imagination was stirred by stories of great catches at night of this excellent
		  food-bird. The woods were said to be full of them. One hunter must hold the bag
		  while three or four others should drive them into it. The Freshman was of
		  course the bag-holder, while the others making a circuit hastened to their
		  rooms and hilariously waited for their victim, who, alone in the forest,
		  longingly watched for the luscious snipes that never came. Such tricks probably
		  saved him in later life from the wiles of “confidence men” and
		  gold-brick dealers, or even from a corner lot in a “boom town,” but
		  it was often a cruel lesson.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p580" n="580"/>
          <p>It was considered a good joke to notify in a mysterious manner some
		  soft-hearted Professor or Minister of the Gospel, or a physician, that a duel
		  to the death was contemplated at a certain spot in the forest or field.
		  Occasionally a fruitless walk in the dark was the consequence. Once the sham
		  duel took place when the peace-maker was hundreds of yards off, and at the
		  explosion of the powder load he hurried home in terror. Dr. W. P. Mallett, who
		  knew not fear, turned the joke on the student, who called for him, by charging
		  him $2 as for a professional visit, and making him pay for it. At
		  another such trick a member of the Faculty rushed in, caught the dead man much
		  to his horror, but did not report him.</p>
          <p>The genial and witty Z. B. Vance, as soon as he stepped out of the
		  stage after the long ride from Asheville at four miles an hour, showed his
		  humor and intuitive perception of what would give pleasure to his comrades. His
		  fellow travelers were old students and were cordially shaking hands with those
		  who came to meet the arrivals. Vance had not an acquaintance, but instead of
		  moping on account of his lonesomeness, he ran up to an old negro standing by,
		  whom he had never seen before, Ben Booth by name, and shook his hand with
		  effusive cordiality—declared that he had been seeking him for years. It
		  made Vance a favorite at once. Handshakings rained on him.</p>
          <p>Students of law, reading without a teacher to test their acquisitions,
		  are at a great disadvantage as compared with those regularly catechised by
		  competent instructors. A young man, a cousin of Vance's, of decided talent,
		  Augustus S. Merrimon, came down from Asheville on his way to the Supreme Court
		  to be examined for his license. He stopped for a day in Chapel Hill and was
		  invited to go before the Professor with the class. He found that although he
		  had a general knowledge of the subject, he was unable readily to answer pointed
		  questions. In truth, his failures to answer were lamentable. As he came out of
		  the room, Vance remarked, “He went in a Merri-man, he came out a sorry
		  man.” He secured his license, however, and became Chief Justice of the
		  Supreme Court.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p581" n="581"/>
          <p>Of course the Temperance Lecturer came to Chapel Hill. Philip S.
		  White, a reformed drunkard, delighted old and young with his oratory, and
		  induced many to join his Society. While the lecture was progressing, some
		  waggish students collected all the bottles that could be found and breaking
		  them made a pyramid of the fragments in the chief walk leading to the village.
		  This novel mode of signifying the success of the movement was greatly
		  enjoyed.</p>
          <p>Another lecturer met a very painful rebuff, a militia Colonel of
		  Georgia, named Dawson. David M. Carter, a man of genius and oratorical ability,
		  very striking in looks, with large rosy face and flaming red hair, a leader in
		  the Philanthropic Society, introduced him to the audience. It was soon after
		  Webster delivered his great speech in favor of the Compromise of 1850. The
		  Colonel illustrated his address by the evil examples of great men, among others
		  Webster, who, he said, often drank to excess, whereupon Carter, who adored
		  Webster, stalked down from the rostrum and out of the hall with an
		  indescribable expression of disgust. Professor Wheat arose and stated that
		  doubtless the speaker would be glad to learn that the distinguished Defender of
		  the Constitution had given up the habit of drinking alcoholic stimulants, but
		  the Colonel declared that he had seen to the contrary at Webster's own
		  sideboard within two or three weeks. Notwithstanding his pluckiness, he was
		  visibly chagrined—his speech was a failure.</p>
          <p>Vance aforesaid of course directed his wit at the Temperance
		  Societies, though he was by no means a drinker to excess. One morning a knot of
		  students were gathered about the well. “Vance,” said Lewis,
		  “what are those boys doing?” His answer was, “Governor Swain
		  was in hot pursuit of Doug. B. Afraid of being caught with whiskey on him,
		  Doug. threw his half-emptied tickler into the well. The temperance boys have
		  been drinking the water ever since, hoping to get a taste of the
		  spirits.”</p>
          <p>A prank for which the perpetrator was sentenced to rustication for a
		  fortnight was by a Raleigh student, generally orderly but of a most humorous
		  turn. There was an immense hat, about a yard high, used as a sign over a
		  sidewalk in Raleigh, <pb xml:id="p582" n="582"/>in front of the dry-goods store of
		  Wm. Peck. The student bought this magnitudinous and altitudinous tile and by
		  tying tape across it managed to balance it on his head. He then stuck a red
		  wafer in the centre of a pair of large green goggles, and with these on his
		  nose and the mountainous hat on his head, marched into the Chapel one afternoon
		  while the roll was being called for Prayers. There was an uproar which for many
		  minutes could not be silenced.</p>
          <p>Another impious prank, which tradition vouches for, was that shortly
		  before the 40's, a youth who had an undue share of deviltry, a few minutes
		  before Chapel service on a summer Sunday morning, dragged a fox skin by devious
		  ways into the Chapel and through the aisles. After the preacher began he turned
		  aloose a pack of hounds on the track, who soon made the building resound with
		  their eager yelps. The records have no allusion to this, from which it may be
		  inferred either that it did not happen, or that the perpetrator was not
		  detected. The preacher could have preached appropriately from the text,
		  “Beware of Dogs.”</p>
          <p>When the boys went off by night to Hillsboro, Pittsboro, or Raleigh,
		  (Durham did not then exist), there was occasionally dissipation and sometimes
		  danger. The University came near losing a handsome legacy on this account.
		  There was an implied agreement that some should remain so cool as to take care
		  of the others. Once Treadwell, of Mississippi, was talking in too loud a tone
		  on the sidewalk in Hillsboro, when his Mentor gave him a caution. “Never
		  mind!” said he, “I do not expect to marry in this burg.” This
		  became a proverb in Chapel Hill circles, as did another expression of his. He
		  was telling of a certain student having been on a “bus.” “I
		  thought,” said the lady, “that he was too stingy.” “Oh!
		  it was only a cheap bus.” Some of these nocturnal journeys to neighboring
		  towns were at a marvellous speed. There was a gray horse named Toodlem, who
		  would cover uninjured the twenty-eight miles to Raleigh in three hours. He was
		  such a favorite that his owners, Mr. and Mrs. Mason, were called Mr. and Mrs.
		  Toodlem, and their handsome daughter Miss Toodlem.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p583" n="583"/>
          <p>A circus was once held at what was called Pinhook, now West Durham.
		  Quite a company ran off to witness it. Some came very near a fight with the
		  circus men, which would have been a serious matter, as there were practically
		  no police officers to interfere. The conflict was averted by Thomas E. Skinner,
		  late a Reverend Doctor, who in those days was not averse to breaking University
		  law for such transcendent bliss as was found under the canvass, but who
		  abstained from strong drink and kept his head. He induced the manager to start
		  suddenly such an exhibition of acrobatic agility and such a blaze of brilliant
		  scenery, as to surprise his friends into forgetfulness of their wrath.</p>
          <p>Vance distinguished himself at a moot-court in defense of the
		  “College Bore,” indicted as a nuisance. Bernard Gretter, a man of
		  great natural ability was prosecutor. Vance's defense was analogous to the
		  famous defense of the bed-bug by S. S. Prentiss—that the Bore was walking
		  in the way the Creator marked out for him—that he taught his suffering
		  fellow creatures patience and resignation, Christian virtues, and so should be
		  numbered with the missionaries; that his conduct showed such lack of brain, as
		  to lead to the conclusion that he was not criminally responsible for his acts.
		  This resumé gives no idea of the wit and eloquence of his argument.</p>
          <p>There was a fine in Vance's Society, the Dialectic, for audible
		  laughing. One night, of malice aforethought and without violating parliamentary
		  law, he made a speech so excruciatingly funny that the listeners were forced to
		  break the anticachinnation rule and the treasury was largely replenished.</p>
          <p>A parody on the opening verses of Byron's Bride of Abydos, written by
		  the late Solicitor General S. F. Phillips, in 1853, contains many local
		  allusions and is on the whole founded on fact.</p>

          <p>Some explanation of the poem may be useful. The optional student, or
		  malish (militia), usually resided in the village and escaped strict
		  surveillance. He could obtain no diploma or certificate of any kind. The
		  buildings were colored and one, Smith Hall, was stuccoed to resemble granite.
		  There were terraces around the Old East and Old West buildings, on which the
		  grass was not then growing. At the spring Senior Speaking the Marshal and his
		  “Subs” kept order. They sat conspicuously in front of the speakers
		  and seemed to, as a part of their office, admire their utterances. Pinhook was
		  a crossroads about twelve miles east of Chapel Hill and Haw River is about the
		  same distance to the west. In older days when boarding “at Commons”
		  was compulsory, the Steward being the lowest bidder, there was a practice among
		  some of supplementing the meagreness of the table by purloining “hen
		  products,” but the crime had become rare. The only nocturnal raids were
		  for fruit, especially scuppernong grapes. It is a source of sincere regret that
		  the opossum is fast becoming extinct in our woods. Hunting them at night was
		  once a pleasant and profitable pastime. Athletics had very little share in the
		  interest of the students, hence they paid more attention to music and to
		  serenading the ladies, who <choice><sic>ofen</sic><corr>often</corr></choice>rewarded their
		  compliment by showers of rose buds. In the spring time there were groups of
		  marble players. The champion at this date was a Junior, Ben Guion, but his
		  aversion to books was not particularly <pb xml:id="p585" n="585"/>obvious, the
		  pleasantry aimed at him notwithstanding. The satire on Dave Moore was not in
		  earnest. His character was high. The liquor bought by students, generally
		  through the agency of negroes, was atrociously bad, some of it colored, it is
		  said, by tobacco. One of its names was “forty yards” whisky,
		  implying that it would kill as far as a rifle ball. Another name embalms the
		  theory in terse Saxon that the liquor is a poison, to the inner man. The
		  increased sobriety in our days is highly gratifying.</p>
          <p>There was no dancing at social gatherings except at Commencements, nor
		  were card parties allowed. “Conversation parties” were common and
		  the ebb and flow of the talk was oceanic. Of course much of it was lacking in
		  sense, and so intended. We had a club in which prizes were offered for the
		  worse pun. The competition was had on the anniversary of the genesis of a pun
		  so extravagantly lacking in wit as to be productive of fun. The prize winner
		  was crowned with a wreath of roses and was King of Bad Puns for the next year.
		  He was seated on an elevated throne, and presided over the competition at the
		  next anniversary.</p>
          <p>At another time bathos, the fall from the sublime to the ridiculous,
		  was fashionable. The following is a good example:</p>
          <lg type="poem">

          <pb xml:id="p586" n="586"/>
          <p>The boys at one time had an amusing way of latinizing proper names.
		  Caldwell was <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Vocatusbene</foreign>.</hi>
		  Anderson (And-her-son) was <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Et ejus
		  filius</foreign>.</hi>Henderson (Hen-her-son) was <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Gallina-ejus-filius</foreign>.</hi>Miss Nancy Hilliard was
		  <hi rend="italics">Miss Nancy <foreign xml:lang="lat">Tumulus-tres-pedes</foreign>.</hi>Governor Swain was
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Gubernator Puer</foreign>,</hi>Judge
		  Battle was <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">Judex Prelium</foreign>,</hi>
		  and so on.</p>
          <p>At another season it was the fashion to use only the first letter of
		  words. For example, French brandy was F. brandy; Daniel Webster was D. Webster;
		  Governor Swain was G. Swain; Parson Green was P. Green; Fried Chicken was F.
		  chicken. Profanity was sometimes softened, for example, D. Fool, or D. S. (<hi rend="italics">damnatus stultus</hi>), and so on.</p>
          <p>The disinclination to call a fellow student by his real name resulted
		  often in giving the younger brother the appellation of the older. For example
		  John H. Bryan (1844), because of his devotion to a great English poet, was
		  called Keats Bryan. His brother, William, late Judge of the Supreme Court of
		  Maryland, was dubbed “Young Keats.” Peter Brown Ruffin (1838-39)
		  had a favorite anecdote in which the upsetting of a stage was the chief
		  incident. So he was universally known as Stage Ruffin. When his brother, Thomas
		  (1844), late Judge of the Supreme Court, matriculated, he became Hack Ruffin, a
		  hack being of inferior dignity to a stage. Even when he attained his highest
		  eminence at the bar an old student would give him this ridiculous nickname.
		  Alfred Alston (1846) was always Nick Alston, his brother Nicholas having
		  preceded him by a year or two, and so on.</p>
          <p>The Literary Trumpet was a pen and ink paper issued in 1846, for
		  private distribution only, by Wm. Matthew Howerton, chief editor, and a lady,
		  who was only a nominal editor. As it was the first of the Fliegende Blatters of
		  the University, I give an extract from it, premising that Howerton was a second
		  honor man, Marshal in 1846, and very popular.</p>

trustees was to procure a proper victualler for the boys, and the secondary care was, as a matter of course, an appropriate Faculty. Looking around on the men of talent and distinguished ability in the State, the Trustees were wonderfully betaken with the idea of securing an indefatigable Mr. Taylor as the best <choice><sic>hotelster</sic><corr>hosteler</corr></choice>to superintend the literary stable of the Hill of Science, who, though he could not furnish the young gents with the fodder and corn of classic lore, was thoroughly conversant in the science of ash-cake and buttermilk.</p>
                  <p>“But without attempting a eulogium upon this great Prince of the kitchen we will simply (as is our subject) apprise our readers of the contract agreed on between Mr. Taylor and the Trustees.</p>

                  <p>“Here we lost all connection in the account of the venerable Steward's duties, so much were we delighted with the idea of this stupendous biscuit.

          <head>AMUSEMENTS.</head>
          <p>At Commencements, as I have said, our streets and roads into the
		  country were gay with handsome equipages. Those who have tried it say that
		  there is no better courting time and place than in a light buggy drawn by a
		  spirited team. But let the amatory youth take warning from the mishap of a
		  friend of mine. He borrowed of his grandfather a barouche and pair and took his
		  lady-love on a four mile ride, determined to bring love matters to a focus.
		  After skirmishing around with preliminary sweet speeches, he turned his head to
		  gaze into her face while he asked her to share his life. As he did so he
		  discovered that the colored boy, whom he had employed to hold his horses at the
		  house of his girl, had jumped up behind and was listening with grinning delight
		  to all tender words. The shock was so great that the opportunity was
		  lost—and as matters turned out, lost forever. My readers need not weep
		  over this story. “Mrs. Grundy” said that the young lady would have
		  refused him. Another “smart” young man driving over Franklin street
		  saw a cow lying contentedly in the way. He thought he would show his
		  skillfulness as a driver by running one wheel over her side. Much to his grief
		  the animal suddenly rose, upset the vehicle, and turned him and his lady-love
		  sprawling into the sand. Unfailingly courteous, too, were the beaux of fifty
		  years ago. I give one specimen of this: A lady friend of mine was taking a ride
		  with a student of the forties. The buggy wheel ran into a deep rut on his side
		  of the road and threw the lady with some violence on him. She said, “I
		  beg your pardon, sir!” He replied with evident sincerity, “Not at
		  all disagreeable, madam!”</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>ATHLETICS.</head>
          <p>There was no gymnasium. As mentioned heretofore, long walks and buggy
		  rides were the fashion. There was seldom a fair evening which did not witness
		  divers couples of ladies and gentlemen wending their way to a forest path. The
		  favorite routes were to Piney Prospect and through the grove near Professor
		  Williams' residence to Tenny's, then Professor <pb xml:id="p589" n="589"/>Green's,
		  plantation. The plantation house, once the residence of Benjamin Yeargin, was
		  at the bottom of the hill near the creek, so there was no unpleasant farm yard
		  litter on the way. It was a beautiful walk with lovely prospects. A side path
		  led to Lone Pine Spring. A shorter, but more romantic walk, was to roaring
		  Fountain, the water trickling beautifully from a mossy bank into a limpid
		  spring. The fountain is still lovely, but the music of falling drops which gave
		  the name is gone. Some ventured as far as Glenburnie, Otey's Retreat and Laurel
		  Hill. Battle Park was then a pathless wilderness. During warm weather the
		  walking was confined to well-traveled roads. Cows roamed at large and in
		  consequence swarms of seed ticks were perched on blades of grass or sprigs of
		  weeds ready to seize the dresses of passers by. Whenever, in pursuit of
		  flowers, chinquepins or blackberries, the girls and boys daringly braved these
		  enemies of peace and comfort, they carried in their hands bunches of
		  pennyroyal, with which to thrash off the successive swarms. Even then some of
		  the blood-thirsty wretches eluded all precautions and unerringly found their
		  way to their coveted feeding ground.</p>
          <p>Athletics was not under University supervision in any degree. The
		  games were, in summer, marbles, in cooler weather, bandy, often called shinny.
		  The latter was peculiarly exciting. It was played at one time on the old, on
		  another on the present Athletic field. Nearly all of the students were engaged.
		  The ball was of hard wood, turned round, and when struck by curved sticks
		  wielded by powerful arms, spun through the air with fearful velocity. In the
		  excitement the sticks were often brandished in disregard of the proximity of
		  the noses and bodies of other players. On the whole it was quite as dangerous
		  as football. There were no deaths, but many severe accidents. The ball once
		  struck a student on one cheek bone and broke the bone on the other side. For
		  many days he was forced to subsist on huge bowls full of soup. His mother said,
		  “You ought to thank your stars that the ball did not strike you on the
		  temple. You would have been killed.” The pain did not allow him a
		  thankful heart. His peevish reply was, “I think I ought to curse my stars
		  for its hitting me at all.” It seems to me that with the proper
		  regulations to ensure <pb xml:id="p590" n="590"/>safety this is one of the best
		  college games. Everybody can play and can play much or little at pleasure. It
		  exercises the legs, arms and, in fact, all the body. It requires strength and
		  agility. It cultivates dexterity and quickness of thought, hardihood and pluck,
		  self-possession and readiness of wit. In one form or another it has been in use
		  probably in all nations. We played it as it was in the Highlands of
		  Scotland.</p>
          <p>I add that intercollegiate games and debates were not known. They, of
		  necessity, awaited the introduction of railroads. I do not recall that there
		  were any match games between the classes. The champions chose their assistants
		  alternately, the privilege of naming first being settled by a rough kind of
		  lottery. One tossed to the other a bandy stick. After being caught each lay
		  hold of it alternately, the hand of one touching that of the other, until the
		  end was reached. The champion who held by the extreme end, if his hold was
		  strong enough to enable him to throw the stick over his head, had first choice
		  of players on the ground. The other had second, and so alternately until all
		  willing to play were in the game.</p>
          <p>The Faculty made no objection to the teaching of the arts of dancing,
		  boxing, fencing, single stick and the like by experts in those accomplishments.
		  There was, however, no regular instructor in dancing until about 1850, when a
		  Mr. Frensley made annual visits to the Hill. The students, before his arrival,
		  practiced hilarious stag-dances in the halls (or passages) of the South
		  building. About the beginning of the Mexican War a Captain, O. A. Buck, a tall,
		  powerful, graceful man, had large classes in fencing, boxing and single stick.
		  I recall that General J. J. Pettigrew, of the Gettysburg charge, was among the
		  most skillful, if not the best. Captain Buck joined the army in Mexico, and
		  died of pulmonary consumption, much regretted by his pupils and others who knew
		  him.</p>
          <p>Hunting partridges, or quail, was more pleasant and profitable than
		  now. Only one plantation, about two and a half miles from town, was
		  “posted,” i. e., prohibiting hunting. As no cotton, but only grain,
		  was raised, the birds were more abundant. Two good huntsmen starting about
		  sunrise, just after Morning Prayers, seldom brought in less than forty or
		  fifty. <pb xml:id="p591" n="591"/>A glorious supper followed, or they were given to
		  the landlady for the next morning's breakfast. A silent, serious looking
		  student, named Lawrence Smith, was fond of hunting alone. One day he found
		  himself two miles from home, the dog pointing a covey in a broom-straw field.
		  To his horror he had left his percussion caps on his chamber table. An oath
		  rose to his lips, but he was a faithful member of the church and he suppressed
		  it. Dropping his gun he shouted the despairing cry, “I've a good mind to
		  cuss!”</p>
          <p>The fishing was very inferior. Probably the lands through which the
		  creeks run are too poor to supply food.</p>
          <p>Opossum hunting was, in those days, a sport of entrancing interest.
		  The picturesque appearance of trees, and rocks, ravines and streams in the
		  flashing torch-light, the musical bark of the dogs eager on the trail, their
		  frantic leaps toward the limbs, after the quarry sought refuge in a tree; the
		  rapid flying of chips as the huntsman wielded his axe; the tottering of the
		  tree, and the excited croy of “Look out!,” then the crash and
		  triumphant capture of the animal with the fat of a thousand persimmons over his
		  ribs. More prosaic, but still interesting, was the supper on the next night,
		  the hot grease exuding from the crisp skin and covering the plump roasted
		  potatoes and well-baked hoe cake.</p>
          <p>The hunting of raccoons was still more exciting, but required a
		  journey of many miles, with doubtful chance of success. The “coons”
		  had mostly migrated to the rivers.</p>
          <p>Of what was called “modern conveniences” there were none.
		  There were practically no bath-rooms and no baths, except at two places half a
		  mile off, where the waters of springs were conducted through gutters and fell
		  <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">sub divo</foreign></hi>in a delicious
		  stream. Most of the students used bath tubs in their rooms. When the weather
		  was warm a few resorted for swimming to Kings, afterwards Valley Pond, to
		  Merritt's afterwards Purefoy's, to “Scott's Hole,” so called from a
		  man drowned in it, to Barbee's afterwards Cave's, or to Suter's Pond. These,
		  except the last, still exist, though, probably owing to the clearing of the
		  land above them, they are more shallow and muddy. They range from one and a
		  half to two and a half miles from the dormitories.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p592" n="592"/>
          <p>At night studying was done by the light of adamantine candles, one
		  being usually sufficient for two persons, sitting by the table on which it was
		  placed. Lamps came in after the middle of the century. Camphene, made of
		  spirits of turpentine, was used at first, but found to be too explosive and
		  dangerous. One student was severely burned and several had narrow escapes from
		  this cause. Notwithstanding the inferior lights there were probably not so many
		  complaints of defective eyes as in recent years. Before the invention of
		  plaited wicks there were much time and patience consumed in removing the
		  accumulated snuff by instruments called snuffers.</p>
          <p>There was no sewerage system, and, until shortly after 1850, slops
		  were thrown from the windows freely. Yet the students were strikingly healthy.
		  Very seldom was one sick unless he brought the disease with him. There was no
		  infirmary until “the Retreat” was built, as hereafter mentioned.
		  Prior to that time the patient, by preference, remained in his own room and was
		  usually nursed with assiduous, though sometimes not skillful, care by his
		  fellow students. Seldom was one willing to be removed to the Retreat, because
		  that would partially separate him from his friends. Occasionally a very sick
		  man was carried to the hotel for the convenience of his mother or other
		  relatives who came to nurse him. Occasionally, too, a mother or lady nurse
		  would be given a room in the dormitory adjoining that of her charge, if he was
		  dangerously sick. At such times the general behaviour was as quiet as in any
		  well-managed hospital. Deaths among the students were infrequent. Prior to the
		  finishing of the railroad to Durham the bodies were, as a rule, buried at
		  Chapel Hill at the expense of the Society to which they respectively belonged,
		  which also erected a monument to their memories. The funerals were very
		  touching; all the Faculty and students marching behind the hearse to the
		  cemetery. As a rule the deaths were painless, the dying persons apparently
		  unconscious of the awful change, but Dr. Hooper told of a young man, who, when
		  informed that he had not long to live, frantically declared that he WOULD NOT
		  DIE; that he was too young to die! Then leaping to the floor with a convulsive
		  effort, swore he would not die, and fell back on his bed to rise no more.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p593" n="593"/>
          <p>The usual resolution that crape should be worn on the arm for thirty
		  days was no idle formula. It was strictly observed by the members of the
		  Society to which the deceased belonged.</p>
          <p>When the numbers increased so rapidly after 1853, in order to supply
		  the demand for dormitories, citizens of the village either rented to students
		  part of their dwellings or built isolated houses for their accommodation. Of
		  course the students racked their brains to give quaint names to these
		  habitations. Some of the Alumni will recognize Bat Hall, Pandemonium, The
		  Poor-House, Possum Quarter, Craigsville, Pickard's (not the Pickard of this
		  day), the Retreat, the Sniddow's (changed from Widow Snipes), the Crystal
		  Palace. After the war some of them were allowed to go to decay, others were
		  sold for negro houses and moved to new sites in the village or in the
		  country.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>VACATIONS.—SOCIAL AMUSEMENTS.</head>
          <p>The vacations were six weeks in summer, from the first Thursday in
		  June, and the same period in winter, beginning about the first of December.
		  There was no “University Day.” The only certain holidays was the
		  22nd of February, and also a “skating holiday” if there happened to
		  be a sufficiently cold spell. There was a good pond in front of Professor
		  Williams' residence, often covered with skaters, some “cutting
		  didos,” as fancy skating was called, others racing, others pulling chairs
		  and sleds on which were seated ladies, all the prettier because the cool
		  morning air brought roses to their cheeks. I recall no female skaters of that
		  day. The Valley Mill pond, then called King's, and Suter's, on the same creek
		  higher up, were also used.</p>
          <p>Many students remained at Chapel Hill during the winter vacations,
		  fewer in the summer. Those who went home in the winter had dreary times getting
		  back over, and under, the miry roads. Eastern students came through Raleigh and
		  Oxford, Westerners through Hillsboro, those from the Southwest by Fayetteville.
		  The mail was carried in huge conveyances, called stages, drawn by four horses,
		  and reached Chapel Hill three times a week from the East, about nine o'clock at
		  night; <pb xml:id="p594" n="594"/>three times from the West, about midday. The
		  drivers were superior men and very popular. When a mile or two from the Post
		  Office they were accustomed to blow long tin trumpets, usually called horns. It
		  is impossible at this day to realize how exquisitely beautiful this music was
		  in a clear cold night, the rattling of wheels over the stones being a fit
		  accompaniment. Nor can those who are accustomed to daily mails imagine the
		  thrilling excitement which stirred the breasts of their grandfathers at the
		  opening of the tri-weekly mails from the East. The students and most of the
		  male villagers collected at the Post Office and great was the crowding and the
		  struggling when the one-eyed postmaster, Esquire McDade, after long delay,
		  opened the door. A single letter or newspaper was a prize. The majority
		  received nothing. If the letter contained money the owner hurried off with his
		  intimate friends to a treat. I remember well Boggan Myers coming out on the top
		  steps, waiving a thick letter and shouting, “Come on, boys. Bowels, boys!
		  bowels! My treat! my treat!”</p>
          <p>Most of the travel and trade of this section went to Raleigh and
		  during the winter the roads, cut up by the heavily loaded four-horse stages and
		  wagons, became almost impassable. The notice posted at a Virginia cross-road
		  was not a great exaggeration, if applied as well to some of the pipe-clay
		  stretches between Chapel Hill and Raleigh.</p>
          <lg type="poem">
            <l>The road is not passable,</l>
            <l>Not even crossable.</l>
            <l>Who wants to travel,</l>
            <l>Must bring his own gravel.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>When the maximum softness and stickiness was reached, in order to get
		  the mail through, the stage would be taken apart, a light box fastened on the
		  front wheels, two seats in front, one for the driver and the other for a
		  passenger. Four strong horses were attached. These would pull through at the
		  rate of two and a half or three miles an hour. I have seen Governor Morehead
		  coming from Greensboro by the side of the driver in such weather. A hack
		  driver, bringing four passengers from Raleigh, charged six dollars each, and
		  probably lost money at that. A student told with Munchausen
		  <pb xml:id="p595" n="595"/>gravity that in the widow Atkins' lane, about seven
		  miles from Chapel Hill, the mud was so soft that a blanket spread on it sunk at
		  once out of sight, and so tenacious that a knitting needle could not be pulled
		  out except by an ox team. Seven vehicles are said to have been stuck in that
		  lane at the same time. The difficulty of travel very seriously interfered with
		  the opening of the winter term. As similarly it prevented the students from
		  visiting other places, it made Chapel Hill all the more a microcosm.</p>
          <p>I met a German pedestrian, who had walked in from the West and was
		  splashed with mud, on his way to Raleigh. I said, “You find the roads
		  muddy.” “Ya,” said he, “foots is more petter as a poggy
		  on this road,” i. e., “feet are better than a buggy.”</p>
          <p>As there was no dancing at Chapel Hill, except at Commencement, the
		  social meetings, then called “parties,” or more elaborately
		  “conversation parties,” now known as “receptions,” were
		  frequent. It seemed that all the guests felt bound to keep up an unceasing flow
		  of talk and laughter, and the clatter was such that, while the talking was
		  always at flood-tide, the listening was at an ebb. In truth it required a
		  practiced ear to distinguish the sounds at all. When a gentleman blew on the
		  flute or sawed on the violin, or a lady, by pressing invitation, coyly or
		  dashingly played on the piano, only those who made the request felt bound to be
		  silent. The rest of the company rattled on with the cruel heedlessness of an
		  alarm clock. But when the performer finished he or she was complimented
		  profusely. Etiquette, however, required that when a male or female singer began
		  all gave attention.</p>
          <p>If a gentleman called on a lady who had a guitar or piano in sight, it
		  was incumbent on him to ask for music, whether he liked it or not. It was keen
		  enjoyment to his companions to watch a fellow visitor, who could not
		  distinguish one note from another, standing by a piano, turning over leaves of
		  the music book and pretending painfully to listen to a ballad of eight verses,
		  eight lines to a verse, or to a “march” in which the imitations of
		  rolling drums and ear-piercing fifes, and the tramp of armies in motion were
		  prolonged to distressing weariness.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p596" n="596"/>
          <p>The usual musical instruments, besides pianos, were flutes, violins
		  and guitars. At the parties the favorite music was singing. The best male
		  singer was James Gallier of New Orleans. His “Fine Old English
		  Gentleman” and “Cork Leg” are sweet memories to this day. The
		  most delightful female singer was a daughter of Professor Green, Miss Mary W.,
		  who died soon after removing to Mississippi. In the parlor, on the steps, in
		  the grove, at picnics, her sweet voice was equally attractive, in pathos and in
		  humor. She would most gracefully give us Scotch ballads and other melodies, sad
		  and comic, in a manner I have never seen surpassed by the best amateurs. It was
		  she who organized and trained, so far as I can ascertain, the first church
		  choir in Chapel Hill, in which students were the larger element, the tunes
		  theretofore having been raised by some one in the congregation. This duty for
		  years fell on Tutor Charles Phillips, who studied music as a part of his
		  Natural Philosophy. Miss Green's choir was for the Episcopal church and
		  received commendation from all listeners. The leader was Richard H. Whitfield,
		  now a druggist in Mississippi. The only instrument was a tuning fork which he
		  used with accuracy. The bass voice of John Manning was exceptionally fine. I
		  doubt if the Grand Te Deum has ever been more sublimely rendered in North
		  Carolina than by this choir. I remember that Bishop Ives, who, notwithstanding
		  his ecclesiastical vagaries, was an able and accomplished man, was fervid in
		  his praises.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the rising generation would like to know what songs pleased
		  their grandparents, so I give a list of the most popular: “A Life on the
		  Ocean Wave;” “Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes;” “A Wet
		  Sheet and a Flowing Sea;” “Gaily the Troubador;” “The
		  Blind Boy;” “Coming Through the Rye;” “I Glowered as
		  I'd Seen a Warlock;” “Johnnie's so Long at the Fair;”
		  “Roy's Wife of Aldivallock;” “Wilt Thou Tempt the Waves With
		  Me;” “Robin Adair;” “Young Rory O'Moore;”
		  “Annie Laurie;” “Whistle, and I'll Come to Thee, My
		  Lad;” “<foreign xml:lang="fre">Vive le Vin, Vive
		  l'Amour</foreign>;” “Lilla's a Lady.”</p>
          <p>There was a noted banjo player of Virginia, named Joe Sweeney, who
		  brought his band of Chapel Hill and gave one <pb xml:id="p597" n="597"/>concert.
		  They set the boys and girls wild over their negro and other comic melodies. For
		  a year or two the banjo and “bones,” viz: fragments of cow ribs
		  held between the fingers and clashed together, were used for accompaniments to
		  the rattling words: “Old Uncle Ned;” “I'm Come From
		  Alabama;” “A Little More Cider;” “Dearest Mae;”
		  “We'll Have a Little Dance;” “On the Banks of the
		  Ohio;” “Rosin, the Beau;” “Carry Me Back to Old
		  Virginia;” <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">et id omne
		  genus</foreign>.</hi></p>
          <p>There was frequent visiting of the popular unmarried ladies, by
		  students sometimes fifteen or twenty in an evening. Some visitors were so
		  verdant that it required all the lady's tact to “bring them out.”
		  One of them astonished his hostess by inquiring, “Miss, do you want a
		  puppy?” “No! why do you ask?” “Oh! just to make
		  talk.” It is fair to state that he claimed that he was quoting a Florida
		  story. The same lady was in the corner of a room talking to a beau, rather
		  rough in his manners. He seemed to be enjoying himself so greatly that five or
		  six others came up to participate in the fun. He looked around in a satisfied
		  way and said, “Miss, we have ‘increasted’ our
		  family.”</p>
          <p>A matron of the village, bright and free-spoken, had three very
		  attractive female visitors, who drew the students as molasses draws the bees.
		  In the midst of the music and jollity the voice of the hostess calling to the
		  housemaid was heard, “Jane! come shut up the house; it is eleven o'clock,
		  time for all decent people to be in bed!”</p>
          <p>The warm-hearted invitation of good Miss Nancy Hilliard, “come
		  and see me and set till bedtime,” has good sense in it, as all who are
		  bound to rise early in the morning will recognize.</p>
          <p>There was, during the forties, a perfect state of harmony in the
		  village, no cliques or rivalries. Not long afterwards there were two rival
		  circles, from which resulted criticisms, tinged with acrimony. It was really
		  amusing to see how different were the angles and facets of the same story in
		  these two circles.</p>
          <p>The first concert, by students and ladies combined, was given in
		  Gerrard Hall, the proceeds of the admission fees going to some religious
		  purpose. There was both vocal and instrumental <pb xml:id="p598" n="598"/>music.
		  The chief mover was a beautiful lady, Miss May Wheat, afterwards Mrs. Francis
		  E. Shober. She was aided by a teacher of music at St. Mary's School, Raleigh,
		  named Mendelsohn, an accomplished violinist. I forget the names of the other
		  participants. The Chief Marshal, at the request of the ladies, was William
		  Watters of New Hanover. In view of the novelty some predicted rowdyism, but the
		  behavior of the students was excellent and the satisfaction general.</p>
          <p>There was no livery stable, though a few horses and buggies were kept
		  for hire in the village. Hence ladies always walked to parties and to church.
		  It was inviolable etiquette for the lady to take the left arm of her escort.
		  The modern, sometime indelicate, innovation of the gentleman grasping her arm
		  above the elbow, would have been thought grossly impudent. Unmarried ladies, as
		  a rule, declined to attend Chapel exercises even in the day time without a male
		  escort. At night it was, to use an old word found in the records,
		  “unthinkable” for them to be found on the streets without such
		  escort, though a mere boy was sufficient. This was because lights were dim
		  within the houses and non-existent without. It was ludicrous to see a stalwart
		  woman walking in satisfied security with a protector urchin, whom she could
		  have easily pitched over the fence. When the night was inky black many a merry
		  laugh was had over the tumbling into invisible ditches, which were not
		  bottomless, howbeit the bottoms were of mud.</p>
          <p>The picnics were as a rule at one of the following places. Otey's
		  Retreat, so named because it was a favorite retreat for Bishop Otey when he was
		  a Tutor here, with his lady love, Miss Bessie Pannill, a remote dell on
		  Morgan's Creek, where yellow jessamine abounds; Laurel Hill, lower down on the
		  same creek, where the rhododendrons and trailing arbutus flourish; Patterson's
		  Mill, at the crossing of New Hope Creek by the Durham road; the Cliffs, a
		  remarkable ledge of rocks near the crossing of New Hope by Oxford road,
		  mentioned by Lawson in his so-called History; Glenburnie, on Bowling's Creek,
		  where the hillsides are covered with evergreen ferns. Resort was sometimes had
		  to two private residences, Esquire <pb xml:id="p599" n="599"/>Charles Johnston's,
		  four miles north of Chapel Hill, and Esquire William Barbee's, three miles to
		  the East, on a high hill known as the Mountain. The daughters of Johnston and
		  Barbee gracefully welcomed the guests to their lawns.</p>
          <p>Besides picnics, tableaux vivants were sometimes presented. As might
		  be expected of such a reading community, well acquainted with history, romance
		  and poetry, the costumes and the incidents were abundantly accurate and
		  interesting, but the costumes and other accessories were all home-made.</p>
          <p>I was called on once to arbitrate a question on an important point of
		  etiquette. A new law student obtained an introduction to a lady peculiarly
		  indifferent to masculine admiration. After talking to him a short while she
		  left him sitting “like a sparrow on the housetop.” He came to me
		  sorrowfully and after stating the case said, “I wish you would tell me
		  whether I ought to get angry or not.” I assured him that the lady treated
		  all men similarly, that she was a confirmed man-hater, and succeeded in
		  pacifying him. In these entertainments and all others alcoholic liquors were
		  excluded. Villagers vied with the Faculty in setting a good example to the
		  students.</p>
          <p>The viands were not only abundant, but were substantial. The rooms
		  were too crowded for servants so two or three gentlemen of the party were
		  requested to aid the hostess. A Mr. A., acting on this duty, piled a plate with
		  slices of turkey and started, with fork in hand, to distribute to the guests.
		  The first he encountered was a buxom widow from a distant state, who was the
		  guest of honor. “Shall I help you to turkey, madam?” “Thank
		  you, sir!” she said, as she took his plate and all that was therein. An
		  artist endeavoring to depict surprise and disappointment could have taken his
		  face for a model.</p>
          <p>Quarles, of Louisiana, of the class of 1863, created much merriment at
		  one of these parties. The child of the hostess, all <choice><sic>elegently</sic><corr>elegantly</corr></choice>dressed, was brought out for general
		  admiration. Quarles offered to take it, but was greeted by a burst of wailing.
		  He went to each lady and, putting on a comical air of grief, announced,
		  “I looked upon the babe and lo! the babe wept.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p600" n="600"/>
          <p>A serious trouble to pedestrians arose from the presence of numerous
		  bovines and hogs on the streets. There was so little traffic that there was an
		  abundance of good pasturage in the village and every family kept at least one
		  cow, and many raised their own pork. Ladies and gentlemen were often compelled
		  to drive animals from the sidewalks in order to pass. The more timid sometimes
		  yielded precedence to the intruders and made a wide circuit to avoid them.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>UNIVERSITY DEPENDENTS AND LABORERS.</head>
          <p>The College Carpenter was Kendall Waitt, a Northern man with the usual
		  Yankee ingenuity and industry. He filled the place for he was “a Jack of
		  all trades.” He was skillful in all kinds of carpenter's work, from
		  building a house to making a coffin. He was an accomplished locksmith and
		  cabinet maker, and if necessary could do good work in a blacksmith shop. He was
		  sometimes paid a salary, about $500, but usually his remuneration was
		  according to work done. In the latter case his bill seemed portentous, but
		  considering the recklessness of breaking and smashing and the inevitable wear
		  and tear of College buildings and Faculty houses, it was probably not
		  exaggerated.</p>
          <p>A white man worthy to be mentioned, although not officially connected
		  with the University, was Washington or Wash Davis, the best athlete and best
		  bootmaker in this part of the world. In the cant phrase of the present day his
		  boots were “creations,” were “dreams.” Graduates, when
		  courting the favor of the fair, frequently sent back to him for their footgear.
		  For boots suitable for Commencement the charge was eight dollars. They were
		  made very tight, but the wearers were willing to submit to pedal torture in
		  order to have a graceful and shining fit. Students having smaller feet were in
		  demand in order to “break,” as it was termed, or stretch, the
		  constricting leather and ameliorate the tormenting twinges. According to my
		  recollection no machine made shoes of modern days, of similar price, equal in
		  elegance and durability Wash. Davis' make, while those then made by machinery
		  were scorned by men aspiring to be well dressed. Patent leather was
		  unknown.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p601" n="601"/>
          <p>There was no Janitor, the two slave servants, Dave Barham and November
		  Caldwell, the latter usually called Doctor November, having charge of all the
		  dormitories and recitation rooms. The name “doctor” was in honor of
		  Dr. Caldwell, to whom he once belonged. They were irreproachable in the
		  performance of duty. Barham was a good moral man; November failing only on the
		  side of unchastity. They were quick beyond belief in making fires, which were
		  kindled always before daylight. One would come into a room with a basket of dry
		  chips on the left arm and a bunch of burning “light-wood” in the
		  left hand. Then a large stick of wood from the pile in the room was thrown to
		  the back of the fireplace, followed by one of similar size in front, with one
		  smaller in the middle. Two or three of the blazing fragments of the torch were
		  placed in the cavity between the front and rear logs, and covered with chips.
		  Two sticks on the top completed the fire. I have never heard of a failure. If
		  only a small fire was required the back log was dispensed with and the blazing
		  torchlets were placed on top of the small stick next to the bricks.</p>
          <p>Dave and the Doctor had great tact in that they pleased Faculty and
		  students. Although thrown for years with all kinds of young men there was only
		  one slight difficulty with one of them, and that arose from a misunderstanding.
		  They made much money for themselves in the way of fees. Few students blackened
		  their own boots or carried their own parcels. The profits of such jobs went to
		  the servants.</p>
          <p>Then there were licensed wood-cutters, the chief of whom was Tom
		  Jones. Tom kept his axe under the South building. He died suddenly from
		  apoplexy without having time to arrange his earthly matters. Alongside of his
		  axe, under a pile of kindling, was found a quantity of corn whiskey, which he
		  had been selling under the name of “light-wood.” So it came to pass
		  that Tom's memory was execrated—by the Faculty. He was an abject
		  “mourner” at every revival for four years, but he never “came
		  through.” He was, in figure and walk, whimsically like Dr. Mitchell.
		  Possibly it was a conscious imitation by him.</p>
          <p>Besides the college servants there were some negroes, who
		  <pb xml:id="p602" n="602"/>in different ways contributed to the amusement and
		  comfort of students. There were Jack and Chesley Merritt, who owned opossum
		  dogs, and for a consideration acted as guides at night in the hunts for 'posums
		  and 'coons. Then there was Ben Boothe, who, on account of his simian features
		  was, after the publication of Darwin's books, called “the Missing
		  Link.” His forte was butting planks asunder by his head, and allowing
		  planks to be split open on the summit of his skull. His charge was five cents
		  for each. After awhile Ben, at a revival, professed religion and felt it his
		  duty to give up worldly pleasures. He could think of no other sacrifice, so he
		  sadly resolved to split planks no more. He then began the imitation of the
		  crowing of a cock, I can not say to remind himself of the humiliation of St.
		  Peter. He was no beggar, worked for his living as long as he was able, and was
		  honest in his dealings. When he became nearly helpless from old age he was well
		  cared for by the King's Daughters, a white organization, which found work for
		  him suitable to his strength, supplementing his gains with what was needful,
		  and when he died bore the expense of his burial.</p>
          <p>Sam Morphis was a picturesque mulatto, a slave, but allowed to
		  “hire his own time,” i. e., to regulate his own actions on paying
		  his master, James M. Morphis, who removed from this state to Texas, author of a
		  history of that state, a stipulated sum per annum. This was against the law,
		  but that was evaded by his having a white man, John H. Watson, to be his
		  nominal hirer. Sam was very handsome, full of humor, an expert manager of
		  horses. His occupation was to drive hacks (as the passenger carriages in use
		  were called), a lucrative business before the advent of railroads. His defect
		  was inclination to alcoholic stimulants.</p>
          <p>In his prime Sam was a great favorite with all classes. As a specimen
		  of his humor I give the following: As he was conveying Professor, now President
		  Winston, from Hillsboro to Chapel Hill, he began to drive recklessly in order
		  to pass all vehicles ahead of him. The Professor saw that he was dangerously
		  near intoxication and prudently insisted on taking the reins. This sobered Sam,
		  and for a full mile he was silent. <pb xml:id="p603" n="603"/>Suddenly he burst
		  into a laugh and exclaimed, “TO THINK of a gentleman of your cloth
		  driving a gentleman of my cloth!”</p>
          <p>He married one of Judge Battle's slaves and then considered himself
		  “one of the family.” After officiating as a driver of a lady's
		  carriage through the mountains where the Judge was very popular, he was asked
		  how he “got along with the mountaineers.” “Splendid,”
		  he said. “Never had no trouble. All I had to do was to tell them that I
		  was Judge Battle's <hi rend="italics">son-in-law,</hi>and they opened their
		  doors and gave me everything they had.”</p>
          <p>After the war he essayed politics, but his mind was weakening and he
		  did not take as high a position as his natural talent seemed to claim. One of
		  his speeches, in a Republican Convention, caused much mirth. He was advocating
		  the nomination of a candidate, who had been a Democrat. “Mr. President,
		  we ought to nominate Mr. ——. He ought to have the office. He has
		  yearnt (earned) it. He came over to our party on purpose to git it, and we
		  would be ongrateful not to give it to him.”</p>
          <p>Like hosts of “drinking men” his mind became more and more
		  feeble, his little property disappeared, and he would have been sent to the
		  County Home to die the death of a pauper, if one of his daughters had not taken
		  him into her humble home. A mind of decided natural strength ended in
		  idiocy.</p>
          <p>A fifth notable negro was George M. Horton, the slave poet. He was a
		  good servant, generally working on the farm of his master, James Horton, but,
		  whenever he wished, allowed to hire his time at fifty cents a day. On such
		  occasions he would visit Chapel Hill and write for the students acrostics on
		  the names of their sweethearts. When his employer was willing to pay fifty
		  cents the poem was generously gushing. Twenty-five cents procured one more
		  lukewarm in passion. He flourished from 1840 to 1860. About 1850 he published a
		  book of poems in paper. After the Civil War he published another edition bound
		  in boards. The book is rare. There is a copy in the Boston Public Library.</p>

		  Chapel Hill until the advent of the Federal Cavalry in 1865. He accompanied a

          <p>Horton was entirely self-taught, picking up his A B C's from scraps of
		  papers which accidently came into his way. Then he gained possession of a
		  spelling book. He conned over such of Wesley's Hymns as he had learned by
		  heart, while listening to the singers. And so, entirely unaided by instruction,
		  he made the acquaintance of Grammar and Prosody and read many books, given or
		  loaned to him by the students. One of his earliest poems began thus,</p>
          <lg type="poem">

          <p>Andrew Mason, of a livid, cadaverous aspect and with a hardly audible
		  squeaking voice, was volunteer hanger-on of the University. He sold night
		  suppers, namely, opossum and chicken in their season, and, when they were not
		  procurable, fried pork and eggs. In consequence of a story that young cats had
		  been substituted for 'possum, it was required that the head should be produced
		  as evidence of good faith. Then the story was supplemented by the alleged
		  discovery that the same head figured in seven different messes. Be this as it
		  may, certain students of medicine under Doctors Jones and Moore, after Andrew's
		  death, took revenge by stealing his body, and doing to it according to the
		  custom of young disciples of the healing art.</p>
          <p>These same medical students played a gruesome trick on a clerk, Abdel
		  Kader Tenny, in the one drug store of the village. A negro of the neighborhood,
		  with the singular name of Asgill, was hung for murder and buried in the Morgan
		  plantation burying ground. They stole the body and while the clerk was alone
		  about eleven o'clock at night, getting ready to close the store, a negro came
		  in with a bag. He said, “some young men sent you a watermelon,” and
		  leaving the gift went away. <pb xml:id="p606" n="606"/>The clerk hastening to feast
		  on the luscious fruit, emptied the bag and found himself alone with the ghastly
		  murderer's head.</p>
          <p>I must not omit the restaurant keepers, both of whom were free negroes
		  and of high character. One was Dave Moore, whose business was conducted
		  opposite the Chapel Hill (then Eagle) Hotel. He had relatives in Ohio and
		  sometimes visited them. He was prosperous, and during the war was known in
		  addition to land, to have several hundred dollars in silver concealed. He died
		  suddenly of heart disease. It was generally believed that the coin was found
		  and stolen by a confidential servant. No legal evidence was forthcoming, but
		  the unexplained possession of considerable money by this servant caused much
		  suspicion.</p>
          <p>The other caterer to the stomachs of the students was Charles J.
		  Burnett, likewise well-to-do. He and his family emigrated to Ohio and
		  prospered. He gave his children a good education at Oberlin and they became
		  teachers in Graded Schools. Burnett's combined dwelling and restaurant was a
		  few yards East of Moore's. It has been torn down.</p>
          <p>Another negro, named Yatney, so quickly answered when he was called,
		  that he acquired the name of Yes Sir! Yatney. His accomplishment was the
		  imitation of a dog fight. It was so realistic that it was impossible to tell
		  that canines were not furiously tearing one another. He made it an invariable
		  condition that he should be in an adjoining closet or otherwise invisible to
		  the auditors.</p>
          <p>My tale of colored men who ministered to the pleasure of students of
		  the forties would not be complete without the further mention of Jack Merritt
		  and Chesley, or Ches. Merritt. They kept 'possum dogs and for a small
		  consideration, after working all day, were ready to be the leaders of the
		  favorite sport of hunting the marsupials. If perchance a racoon, or 'coon, was
		  caught, the pleasure was intensified, as he was “game” and a stout
		  fight with the dogs resulted. Although experts at woodcraft, I know by
		  experience that they were not infallible. One night I accompanied Ches. and a
		  party of students into the woody bottoms of Bowlin's Creek. We were in pursuit
		  of the lordly 'coon. No grinning 'possum for us. The dogs opened
		  <pb xml:id="p607" n="607"/>cheeringly. Ches. was in <choice><sic>estasies</sic><corr>ecstasies</corr></choice>. “I know its a 'coon by the way the dogs
		  bark. They don't bark that way for 'possums.” Away we went through water,
		  briars and bushes. Ches. shouted, “I know it's a 'coon, bekase he runs so
		  fur. A 'possum would have climed a tree long ago.” Finally the dogs treed
		  the game. They barked furiously up a tall poplar. Ches. was exultant and
		  shouted, “Now I knows it's a 'coon, bekase 'possums never climbs big
		  trees.” After much vigorous cutting the tree crashed on the ground. We
		  turned loose the dogs, whom we had been holding to protect them from injury
		  from the falling branches. At the same time Ches. ran in to the game. Without
		  the slightest shame for his false prediction, he sung out, “Nothing but
		  an old she 'possum. She's so lean—that's de reason she run so fur.”
		  And we returned to our habitations after having more fun than game.</p>
          <p>The name of a singular character should be recorded—Leroy Couch,
		  a white man. He once owned, it is said, considerable substance, but lost it by
		  dissipation. He seemed to have no kin. He sought no acquaintances. He bought or
		  squatted on an acre near the eastern edge of the town and with the remnants of
		  his possessions lived a hard, squalid and solitary life. In some way it was
		  discovered that he was a faithful and skillful nurse and, on petition of nearly
		  the entire student body, he was employed for years in all cases of severe
		  sickness among the students. Without pretending to independent knowledge, he
		  implicitly obeyed the doctors, watched his patients with unsleeping vigilance
		  and rendered the needful service with regularity. When the University was
		  closed, as if his mission was finished, he returned to his solitary life, was
		  extremely poor, but never begged and, when decrepit, died in the county home
		  for paupers. Two or three other houses were built near his, and the settlement,
		  separate from the village habitations, was called Couchtown. Handsome
		  residences now extend to this distant and obscure hamlet.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE VILLAGE.</head>
          <p>The principal merchants of the village about 1845 were John W. Carr,
		  of Orange County, and Jesse Hargrave, of Davidson County. The latter married a
		  daughter of Wm. Barbee. Both <pb xml:id="p608" n="608"/>were quiet, prosperous and
		  useful citizens, the former being the father of one of the chief benefactors of
		  the University, Julian S. Carr.</p>
          <p>Transportation of packages by mail and express was not then developed
		  to much extent, and country merchants did not suffer seriously from their
		  competition. The following will show the range of prices about 1845: French
		  calico, 35 cents a yard; white factory cloth, 25 cents; spool sewing thread, 10
		  cents; beef, mutton, fresh pork, 4 and 5 cents a pound; butter, 12 1-2 cents;
		  eggs, 8 to 10 cents a dozen; turkeys, 40 to 50 cents each; flour, $5.00
		  a barrel; corn meal, 40 to 50 cents per bushel.</p>
          <p>The average housekeeping expenses, exclusive of clothing, for a young
		  professor, wife and two children, were about $750 per annum. The
		  groceries were usually bought by barrel or sack and hauled by wagon from
		  Fayetteville, at an earlier date from Petersburg. It must be remembered that
		  the influences of the Panic of 1837 had not passed away entirely when these
		  prices were recorded. Manufactured goods speedily fell in price by improvements
		  in transportation and machinery. Of course the coming of the railroad made
		  great changes. Up to that time the arrival of the McCauley wagon, with its
		  coffee, sugar, molasses, and in the earlier days wine, was eagerly expected.
		  This wagon line belonged to the father of our townsman, David McCauley.</p>
          <p>The physicians of the place were notable men. The leaders were
		  Johnston Blakely Jones and George Moore. Both were of distinguished lineage,
		  the former being a son of Solicitor General Edward Jones, claiming to be a
		  descendant of Jeremy Taylor; the latter of the blood of Governor James Moore,
		  of South Carolina, and of Governor Sir John Yeamans. Jones was a man of genius
		  and an acknowledged authority in his profession. He was, however, except when
		  aroused by a dangerous case, fond of his ease and without ambition. I have
		  known him to come to my father's home by a circuitous route, in order to avoid
		  a call for his services and spend hours in talking and reading Don Quixote. He
		  had a theory which I mention to incite investigation by makers of
		  perfumery—that successive odors could be made to play on the nerves of
		  smell, and produce sensations analagous to musical sounds impinging
		  <pb xml:id="p609" n="609"/>on the nerves of hearing. Just prior to the Civil War he
		  invested his own and wife's property in slaves and a cotton plantation in
		  Lenoir County, and lost all. After the Civil War he removed to Charlotte and
		  was a leader in his profession.</p>
          <p>Doctor Moore was a silent, reserved man, the soul of truthfulness and
		  honor; a good physician, but without the genius of his partner. He gave the
		  impression that he did not know what fear was. He had great respect for
		  religion, often attended church, but did not become a member. On his deathbed
		  he called his nurse, Miss Sally Williams, who was a simple-minded, devout
		  Christian, and said, “Miss Sally, do you think that a man will go to hell
		  for not believing all that is in the Bible?” She faltered out, “I
		  suppose I must.” “Well,” he replied, “I don't, I can't.
		  I have never to my knowledge lied or cheated. I have been charitable to the
		  extent of my means. I never was a coward. I have paid my debts as far as I
		  possibly could. Now if they send me to hell, I will go a grumbling.” And
		  so he died.</p>
          <p>This Miss Sally Williams, long a housekeeper in Professor Green's
		  large family and the forerunner in a humble way of the modern professional
		  nurse, deserves further notice.</p>
          <p>She performed her duty thoroughly, her wages being $5 a month.
		  Unobtrusive as she was, she had the endurance of a martyr. When she died it was
		  found that for years she had been suffering from a painful, eating cancer on
		  her bosom. She had concealed it from all the world. I add that though she had
		  no conception of a witticism, she once unintentionally, in a church meeting, by
		  reason of the depth of her earnestness and fervor of her piety, made an inquiry
		  which convulsed the company. There was a meeting of the Episcopal congregation
		  to ascertain whether money could be raised sufficient to pay a preacher. After
		  much canvassing it was pronounced impossible. Losing her bashfulness in her
		  excitement, she burst out, “Can't we raise enough to hire a little
		  deac?” The suggestion was adopted. The little deac. was hired. She had a
		  sister of similar virtues, who went from house to house as a
		  seamstress—very slow, but very sure. She took it good naturedly when
		  <pb xml:id="p610" n="610"/>a boy, whom she liked, said, “Miss Matilda, did
		  you ever see a snail?” “Yes, why do you ask?” “Well,
		  you must have met him, you did not overtake him.”</p>
          <p>Doctors Jones and Moore had the practice of the well-to-do families.
		  There was another physician, Charles Yancey, who was generally called
		  “Bullet Yancey, because of having only one shining black eye. He had the
		  reputation of possessing a fine natural talent for the healing science, but was
		  of incorrigibly intemperate habits. He could be heard singing about
		  “Commodore McDonough and General Jackson,” and “some love
		  coffee and some love tea, but corn-cob whiskey is good enough for me,” in
		  a most maudlin voice, while he was barely able to keep his horse as he rode at
		  midnight, or later, through the streets. His second marriage gave much
		  merriment to the village. The bride's father had no eyes, the groom had only
		  one, the officiating Justice had the same defect, and the best man was a deaf
		  mute, the groom's brother. The result was a fair measure of connubial bliss,
		  cut short by the speedy death of the husband.</p>
          <p>The deaf mute, Lemuel Yancey, brother of the doctor, was an important
		  part of the community. He was totally uneducated, except by experience. He
		  invented for himself vivid natural signs, sometime ludicrous, but always
		  expressive. To represent President Swain, with his knock-kneed legs, he, with
		  his hands, indicated this divergence, at the same time assuming an air of
		  dignity. For the President's wife and daughters he added to the foregoing a
		  motion indicating the swelling front of the upper part of a lady's dress. He
		  designated Judge Battle by crossing his fingers like the bars of a jail window,
		  then looking through them and imitating the turning of a key. He made it his
		  business to gather the news and then walk about from man to man, retailing it,
		  always pressing his hand on his mouth and shaking his head; thereby signifying
		  secrecy. He was a Whig and was never known to vote a Democratic ticket. He
		  selected as his advisers one of our best men, Mr. McCauley, and adhered rigidly
		  to his advice. He was very intelligent and thoroughly reliable, but never was
		  known to work. He had a small property whose income was supplemented by
		  <pb xml:id="p611" n="611"/>his brother and the generosity of neighbors. He was no
		  beggar. He accepted, but never asked for gifts.</p>
          <p>About 1845 the village of Chapel Hill seemed to make a beginning of
		  prosperity. Sales were made—on Rosemary street, four acres to Gabriel
		  Utley and others; on Columbia street, to William Hogan two acres; two acres to
		  Miss Sally Mallett on College street, now called Cameron avenue. Sales had
		  already been made to Dr. Johnston B. Jones of four acres on Franklin street,
		  and to Judge Battle of two acres adjoining his residence. An application by
		  Judge Battle to purchase the grove in front of his dwelling, East of the
		  Raleigh road, was declined, as was also a proposal by Mrs. Anne C. Hall to buy
		  a lot South of his dwelling. President Swain stated that it was the policy of
		  the University to have no further settlements East and South of the Campus.
		  Testimony proving this refusal induced the Circuit Court of the United States,
		  Judge H. L. Bond presiding, to allow to the University as its site, as
		  contradistinguished from endowment for support, the land from the Pittsboro
		  road to the Durham road, including the Campus and buildings thereon, and also
		  the Professors' residence, in all about 600 acres.</p>
          <p>From time to time were sold other parcels of land belonging to the
		  University at about $100 an acre as a rule. In 1846 the beautiful oak
		  grove at the northwest corner of Franklin and Columbia streets, where the
		  people were used to meet to listen to the speeches of candidates, was conveyed
		  to John W. Carr for $300. In the same year the lot where was the Village
		  Chapel, was bought for $200 by Prof. James Phillips, as trustee, for the
		  site of the Presbyterian Church, with the stipulation that no burials should be
		  had therein. The Chapel was removed a few hundred yards northward and, much
		  enlarged, was, until lately, used for the public school. The lot between that
		  of the Presbyterian Church and Henderson street was afterwards sold to Mickle
		  and Ashe for $150.</p>
          <p>Chapel Hill at the beginning of this period was diminutive and
		  struggling, surrounded by extensive forests in all directions, except where
		  broken here and there by cultivated or worn-out fields. Up to 1848 there was no
		  church edifice used <pb xml:id="p612" n="612"/>solely for divine services. Person
		  Hall up to 1838 and then Gerrard Hall, the Old Chapel and the New Chapel, were
		  used for all assemblies, sacred and profane, at one hour decorous divine
		  worship, at another a boisterous mass-meeting of students, at another academic
		  exercise of speaking, at others the various functions of Commencement. There
		  was, however, the “Union” or “Village Chapel,” used at
		  Sunday nights for the worship of God, in week days as a school-house. There was
		  one Hotel, the Eagle, presided over by the eagle-eyed old maid, Miss Nancy
		  Hilliard, who had all the traveling custom and most of that of the University.
		  Her table was bountiful and the food well cooked, and the wonder was how
		  receipts could balance expenses. She was accustomed to say that she lost on the
		  students, but the travelers and the rich harvests at Commencements more than
		  supplied the deficiency. How much her uncollected dues from students unable or
		  unwilling to pay, amount to, will never be known, but they were very large.
		  When the University was most prosperous, having no help but that of a
		  good-natured but improvident brother-in-law, Benton Utley, she sold her hotel
		  interest to Col. Hugh B. Guthrie and took charge of the North Carolina Railroad
		  eating-house at Company Shops, now Burlington. The feebleness of old age and
		  the losses of the war impoverished her. In her last sickness she was tenderly
		  nursed by Mr. Utley, and was buried in the Chapel Hill Cemetery. At the
		  instance of Mrs. C. P. Spencer, alumni, who retained an affectionate
		  remembrance of their old landlady, erected over her grave a marble slab with
		  this inscription:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>NANCY S. HILLIARD.<lb/>
		Born in Granville County, October 17, 1798.<lb/>
		Died in Chapel Hill, November 8, 1873.<lb/>
		ERECTED 1886, <lb/>By certain alumni of this University, in <lb/>
		  grateful remembrance of her unfailing <lb/>kindness and <lb/>
		  hospitality.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Nor was there lacking the discovery of a Mineral Spring. It was below
		  a mill, which then stood near the crossing of Bowling's Creek by the road to
		  Durham. It was pronounced to <pb xml:id="p613" n="613"/>be chalybeate and was soon
		  reported to be effecting cures of half-sick bodies. A large hotel was talked
		  of, and visions of fashionable visitors indulged in. But, alas! furious waters,
		  after a great rain, broke the dam. The spring disappeared. It was merely the
		  seepage of the water of the dam through the mud and trash accumulated at the
		  bottom. Dr. Mitchell once said, “They take water which has percolated
		  through decayed leaves and the carcases of dead cats or pigs and rusty
		  horsehoes and the like, and because it stinks they send it to me to analyze as
		  mineral water.” In quoting from the Doctor I must not be understood as
		  reflecting on the Strowd spring, discovered in more modern times, and
		  undoubtedly containing iron.</p>
          <p>The cool drinking water used by the students was drawn from the famous
		  “College well” by rope and windlass. Despite of the modern theory
		  of bacteria and other germs, a case of sickness from this source was never
		  heard of. The song of the Old Oaken Bucket was a reality in Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The failure of the scheme of living at Commons was caused in a general
		  way by the increase in the size of the village and the advent of boarding-house
		  keepers, who supplied good food at moderate prices. Some parents made Chapel
		  Hill their home in order to educate their boys, others to repair fortunes lost
		  in the Panic of 1837 and the stringency following. But the chief cause was the
		  unparalleled efficiency and popularity of Miss Nancy Hilliard. “Miss
		  Nancy,” as she was called, redeemed a homely face by the correctness of
		  her principles, her energy, pluck and good sense. To a student, sick or in
		  trouble, she was as tender as a mother. To one who was wayward she was a candid
		  and kind counsellor.</p>
          <p>Another good lady of the old school who for fifty years cared for the
		  stomachs of successive waves of students and unmarried professors, but was now
		  nearing the close of an active and useful life, was Mrs. Elizabeth Nunn, widow
		  of Captain William Nunn, of the Revolutionary army. In matters of business she
		  had the strength and boldness of a man, but her disposition was kindly,
		  generous and sympathetic. She was much beloved and respected by the students,
		  and many <pb xml:id="p614" n="614"/>hearts were moved when she died December 20,
		  1851, in the 92nd year of her age. She was one of the last survivors of the old
		  troublous times, having in her girlhood lived among the Regulators and shared
		  in the privations and anxieties of the War of the Revolution. When asked which
		  side she favored in the Regulator troubles, her answer was, “I was as
		  good a Regulator as ever hopped.”</p>
          <p>The Campus prior to 1851 was a forest just as nature left it, with the
		  underbrush cleared off. The trees were not thinned out, nor was it until then
		  that the well-paved walks were constructed. The Campus practically extended
		  only to the open space adjoining the Raleigh road, there being between them a
		  rail fence and thick hedgerow, obstructing the outlook towards the east. The
		  enclosure was used as a pasture for the President's cattle. On it afterwards
		  browsed his white mule, Cuddie, who so often paid nocturnal visits to the attic
		  of the South Building—frequently painted with stripes like a zebra.
		  “It is the courage that marks the assassin!,” vehemently harrangued
		  the President. “It is the courage that marks old Cuddie,” whispered
		  William Knight, of Edgecombe, afterwards a gallant Confederate Colonel.</p>
          <p>In the middle of Cameron Avenue, in front of the Carr Building, facing
		  the west, was the wooden residence, white-painted, with green blinds, known as
		  Steward's Hall, where for many years the students obtained their nutriment for
		  the inner man. 1844 was the last year of its existence under University
		  authority. The next year the building was rented as a private residence, and
		  soon afterwards was sold and now forms a part of the late village
		  school-house.</p>

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1850.</head>
          <p>At the <choice><sic>Commecement</sic><corr>Commencement</corr></choice>of 1850 the
		  Baccalaureate sermon was preached by the Rev. Dr. Wm. Hooper, of the class of
		  1809. His subject was “The Force of Habit.” The sermon was printed,
		  and its excellence caused it to be rated high among the classics of the
		  State.</p>
          <p>The Declaimers from the Freshman Class were Nathaniel C. Jones, John
		  W. Johnston, Walker Meares, James M. Spencer, Junius B. Wheeler, George M.
		  White, John T. Taylor, M. William Wise, David G. Worth. They appeared before
		  the public Monday night. On Tuesday night appeared Wm. D. Barnes, Hutchins G.
		  Burton, Wm. M. Carrington, John M. Dennis, Wm. E. Drisdale, Thomas H. Gilliam,
		  Thomas C. Leak, Joseph A. Manning, James B. Slade, Basil M. Thompson. The
		  audience seemed to favor Manning and Taylor as the best.</p>
          <p>The Annual Address was by Wm. Waightstill Avery, of the Class of 1837,
		  on State Pride, the duty of which, as well as our reasons for possessing it, he
		  strongly enforced.</p>
          <p>At the meeting of the Alumni Association the following were reported
		  as having died the preceding year, namely: James K. Polk, 1818; Philip E.
		  Bradley, 1839; Hillory M. Wilder, 1846, and James W. Duke, 1847. On motion of
		  President Swain, a committee was appointed to prepare a suitable memoir of
		  President Polk, to be filed in the Archives. The Annual Address was by Dr.
		  Thomas H. Wright (1818), a copy of which was asked for likewise to be filed in
		  the Archives. The Literary Address was by Hon. James C. Dobbin, of the Class of
		  1832, in a few years to be Secretary of the Navy under President Pierce. It was
		  an eloquent portrayal of the sources of the enjoyment and influence of the
		  cultivated mind.</p>
          <p>The Senior speeches were as follows:</p>
          <p>Salutatory (in Latin), Richard Hines.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p616" n="616"/>
          <p>“<foreign xml:lang="lat">Quo Difficilius, Hoc
		  Preclarius</foreign>,” Washington C. Kerr.</p>
          <p>“The Influence of Religion on Law,” John Manning.</p>
          <p>“Infidelity,” Benjamin R. Huske.</p>
          <p>“<foreign xml:lang="lat">Vincat Utilitas</foreign>,” Edward C.
		  Chambers.</p>
          <p>“Co-operation of Christianity with Philosophy,” Wm. Henry
		  Johnston.</p>
          <p>“Dismemberment of Poland,” Richard H. Whitfield.</p>
          <p>“Honor to Distinction Due,” A. Julius Caldwell.</p>
          <p>“Early History of North Carolina,” Richard L. Smith.</p>
          <p>“Revolutions and Reforms of the 19th Century,” Thomas
		  Settle.</p>
          <p>“The Reformation in the 16th Century,” Henry Hardie.</p>
          <p>Valedictory, John Hill.</p>
          <p>The first honor men: Hill, Johnston and Kerr drew lots for the
		  Valedictory and Salutatory. Both Johnston and Kerr preferred an English speech.
		  Hines was induced to take the Salutatory.</p>
          <p>The second honor men were Caldwell, Chambers, Hines, Huske, and
		  Smith.</p>
          <p>Those who stood third were Hardie, Settle, and R. Whitfield.</p>
          <p>The honor men, as a rule, won similar honors in after life. Hill was
		  an accomplished physician, who died too early to become eminent. Kerr was our
		  distinguished State Geologist; Johnston one of the ablest counsellors at the
		  Edgecombe bar; Hines a Doctor of Divinity in the Episcopal Church; Huske a
		  prominent lawyer, a Major in the Confederate service, in which he lost his
		  life; Manning, able lawyer, Code Commissioner, member of the Legislature and
		  Convention of 1861, a very successful Professor of Law in the University;
		  refused office of Judge and of Secretary of State; Settle was Presidential
		  Elector, Confederate Captain, Speaker of the State Senate, Judge of the Supreme
		  Court of North Carolina, Minister to Peru, President of Republican National
		  Convention, Judge of the U. S. District Court of Florida.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Master of Arts was conferred on James B.
		  Donnelly, of North Carolina.</p>

          </p>
          <pb xml:id="p617" n="617"/>
          <p>The list of Confederate dead among the matriculates rapidly grows
		  larger. They were for 1850: Clinton M. Andrews, Colonel; John B. Andrews,
		  Captain; Jesse Averitt, Sergeant; D. Whiting Husted, Lieutenant; J. Glenn
		  Jeffreys, Lieutenant; Leonidas J. Merritt, Lieutenant; John T. Wheat, Captain;
		  Carey Whitaker, Captain; Bryan Whitfield, Captain.</p>
          <p>The two Societies had requested that the proceeds of the sale of
		  Stewards' Hall should be appropriated towards the construction of a hall for
		  the meeting of the Alumni Association and for balls at Commencement. In
		  January, 1849, the Committee resolved that there should be a building to be
		  used by the Trustees and Alumni Association as a dining-hall, and also a
		  ball-room at Commencements, “and for such other public purposes as the
		  Trustees might direct.” The building must be of brick, one story high,
		  near the other college buildings. President Swain and Judge Battle were
		  appointed to procure a plan with an estimate of cost and to designate a site.
		  On July 16th they suggested that the building should likewise accommodate the
		  University Library and belfry, as well as the objects theretofore designated.
		  This was approved, and they were requested to contract for and superintend the
		  work.</p>
          <p>In 1850 A. J. Davis, of New York, architect, met the Committee in
		  Raleigh, and was instructed to alter the plans so that the main hall should be
		  ninety feet long, which was done.</p>
          <p>The builder was Captain John Berry, a very substantial citizen of
		  Orange, State Senator in 1848, and repeatedly afterwards. The cost was about
		  $10,000. The building designed for so many purposes, aesthetic and
		  literary, was named, a belated honor, Smith Hall, to commemorate General and
		  Governor Smith, a sketch of whom has been heretofore given. In a few years an
		  important use was found for the basement, to serve as a Chemical Laboratory.
		  The project of attaching a belfry to it was abandoned.</p>
          <p>The retirement of Bishop Green led to the election of Rev. John Thomas
		  Wheat, D.D., to the Chair of Rhetoric and Logic. His competitors were John
		  Sutherland Lewis, W. C. Richards, and Albert M. Shipp. The latter was chosen to
		  fill a new professorship, that of History and English literature.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p618" n="618"/>
          <p>Dr. Wheat was born in Washington City November 15th, 1801. While a
		  student at the Episcopal Theological Seminary at Alexandria, he was instructor
		  of a class of thirty advanced pupils. He was ordered Deacon by Bishop Moore, of
		  Virginia, in 1825, and the next year ordained priest by Bishop Kemp, of
		  Maryland. He then had charge successively of St. Matthew's Church, Wheeling;
		  St. Pauls, New Orleans, and of Christ Church, Nashville, Tennessee. In 1849, at
		  the earnest request of Bishop Otey, he accepted the principalship of a new
		  institution, the Ravenscroft Theological Seminary at Columbia. In despite of
		  energetic labor, the enterprise failed for want of patronage. His most
		  influential recommendation to the University of North Carolina came from Bishop
		  Otey, whose high character and former connection with it made his advice potent
		  with the Trustees. Dr. Wheat proved to be an active and energetic professor,
		  and his family added much to the social attractions of the village.</p>
          <p>At the meeting of the Alumni the first Vice-President, Governor
		  Charles Manly, presided. Nine new members were admitted. Wm. J. Bingham moved
		  that the members of the Faculty might by unanimous vote be admitted as honorary
		  members. The resolution was laid upon the table until the meeting in 1853, and
		  then passed. President Swain, Wm. J. Bingham, and Wm. H. Battle were appointed
		  to decide upon a plan for the Caldwell monument, and take steps for its
		  completion. Obituaries of B. W. L. Claiborne and J. Mallett DeBerniere were
		  ordered to be filed.</p>
          <p>Governor Manly was elected President.</p>
          <p>At this Commencement a difficult question came up. The ball managers
		  and marshals had ordered a quantity of spirituous liquors, in addition to wine,
		  which was not forbidden, chiefly for visitors, including some Trustees.
		  Students broke into the room where the stores were deposited and a carousal
		  ensued. The Faculty felt bound to dismiss the officers, who had broken the law
		  against the introduction of liquors. Some of them were among the best students.
		  Besides, the summary sending away of all the officers would have been a serious
		  blow to the success of the Commencement. The Trustees <pb xml:id="p619" n="619"/>
		  came to the rescue. On motion of ex-Governor Graham it was ordered that in the
		  preparation for the balls and other entertainments at the University no
		  spirituous liquors shall be introduced or used, and a manager violating the
		  ordinance shall be dismissed. The Faculty, in consideration of this ordinance,
		  were requested to rescind their determination in cases occurring that day in
		  violation of it.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>RIOT—METHODIST CHURCH.</head>
          <p>There was a dangerous riot on the night of August 13th, 1850. A number
		  of students, eight or ten, while drinking and shouting boisterously, became
		  incensed with two of the professors for interfering, and stoned them so
		  violently that they were forced to take refuge in the room of a student. A
		  tall, strong rioter from the Southwest climbed up to the window, and was
		  endeavoring to assault them with a huge stone when he was struck with a chair
		  by one of the attacked party. There ensued a fierce cry to burst open the door
		  and kill the assailant. J. J. Slade, a firm and orderly young man, afterwards
		  Principal of a prominent Female School in Columbus, Georgia, assisted by
		  others, parleyed with the rioters, and a treaty was made by which the members
		  of the Faculty retired from the campus in safety. After one o'clock all the
		  Faculty inspected the rooms in college. The tall rioter with the murderous
		  stone was next day expelled, another was dismissed, and one suspended, eight
		  found out of their rooms, but denying participation, were admonished. The case
		  was laid before a special meeting of the Board of Trustees at Hillsboro, who
		  ordered the evidence to be presented to the Solicitor of the Judicial District
		  with a view of prosecuting the offenders. When at the next Commencement the
		  Board concurred in the sentence of expulsion of the two leaders; it was entered
		  of record that it had been proved in the Superior Court of Orange that they had
		  destroyed wilfully much University property, and had assaulted with intent to
		  kill, two of the Faculty. They were not however criminally punished, having
		  left the State.</p>
          <p>The Methodists of Chapel Hill first met for worship in the residence
		  (not now standing) of Miles Davis, on the north side of Rosemary Street in the
		  rear of the Presbyterian Church. <pb xml:id="p620" n="620"/>Afterwards in the
		  forties the upper story of Jesse Hargrave's store (now McCauley's) was used. In
		  that room young Chas. F. Deems, afterwards D.D., LL.D., a Professor in the
		  University, preached excellent sermons, at the invitation of the people, but
		  not perhaps by appointment of the Bishop. Dr. Deems named the hall, which had
		  once been a Mason's Lodge, Bethesda—the House of Mercy.</p>
          <p>After Dr. Deems left the University in 1848, ministers were regularly
		  appointed to this charge. In January, 1851, Rev. J. Milton Frost, afterwards
		  D.D., of Mocksville, was stationed in Chapel Hill, not only taking charge of
		  the congregation, but pursuing a course in the University leading to the degree
		  of A.B., in 1852. Being an able man and of active temperament, he determined to
		  build a church, and set himself to raise the funds necessary. He visited
		  Greensboro, Salisbury, Lexington, Hillsboro, Pittsboro, Raleigh, Louisburg,
		  Warrenton, Shady Grove in Warren County, Henderson, and South Lowell, and
		  succeeded in raising the handsome sum of $5,000, which was sufficient to
		  pay for the lot and build the church. It was dedicated July 31st, 1853, by Rev.
		  Rufus T. Heflin. The contractor was Horn, of Pittsboro.</p>
          <p>Dr. Frost was succeeded by Rev. J. L. Fisher, after whom, in 1853,
		  came Rev. L. S. Burkhead, who married a beautiful daughter of Miles Davis.
		  Subsequent preachers were Rev. P. Doub in 1854, Rev. H. T. Hudson in 1855-6,
		  Rev. A. W. Mangum, 1857-8, afterwards D.D., and Professor in the University,
		  Rev. J. A. Cunninggim 1859-60, Rev. J. W. Jenkins 1861-2, Rev. R. A. Willis
		  1863, Rev. W. C. Wilson 1864, Rev. R. S. Webb 1865, Rev. O. J. Brent
		  1866-67-68.</p>
          <p>This church building is on the corner of Rosemary and Henderson
		  streets. The lot was bought of the University. When the new church was erected
		  on Franklin street the old lot was sold to the Congregationalists, who
		  subsequently parted with it, and is now used for secular purposes.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>FRATERNITIES.</head>
          <p>I cannot find any ordinance of the Board or resolution of the Faculty
		  admitting Fraternities, but in 1851 they began to enter the University.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p621" n="621"/>
          <p>The Sigma Alpha Epsilon, S. A. E., was established in 1857, and
		  withdrew before the close of the war.</p>
          <p>I have been unable to obtain the statistics of any except that of Zeta
		  Psi, the history of this University branch having been written by Dr. Wm. J.
		  Battle, of the University of Texas. It was organized in January, 1858. It had
		  in the Confederate service four Colonels, one Lieutenant-Colonel, three Majors,
		  six Captains, nine Lieutenants, three Surgeons, one Adjutant-General, one
		  Adjutant, one Orderly Sergeant, one scout, twenty-seven privates. Nine were
		  killed.</p>
          <p>The Delta Kappa Epsilon, D. K. E., was organized in 1851, and withdrew
		  in 1861. They had 34 members. The Beta Theta Pi was established in 1852, and
		  withdrew in 1859. There were probably others. All were dissolved before the end
		  of the war.</p>
          <p>I was informed by Judge Augustus Van Wyck, of Brooklyn, N. Y., that
		  his membership at Chapel Hill was of eminent service to him when he settled, a
		  stranger, in New York. The members there from other institutions soon gave him
		  a large, pleasant and profitable circle of friends.</p>
          <p>Similar testimony as to their value was given after the reopening in
		  1875 before the Board of Trustees by General Julian S. Carr, Captain James A.
		  Graham, Colonel Paul B. Means, and the late Eugene L. Morehead.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>ESCHEATS.</head>
          <p>It has been mentioned that by the charter escheats, i. e., real
		  property whose owner died without an heir capable of inheriting, were given to
		  the University. Lawyers were appointed in different sections of the State to
		  look out for these windfalls. This plan was successful for many years, but in
		  course of time, when escheats became fewer, these lawyers, being as a rule men
		  of large business, became less attentive.</p>
          <p>In 1798 the General Assembly enacted that if executors or
		  administrators should have funds in their hands belonging to the estate, and
		  the legatee or distributee entitled could not be found for seven years, the
		  same should be paid to the University to be held without interest until the end
		  of ten years, and if the claimant did not appear, it should be irreclaimable.
		  In 1868 five years were substituted for seven.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p622" n="622"/>
          <p>At the December, 1850, meeting the Board appointed Messrs. J. H.
		  Bryan, David L. Swain, and B. F. Moore to examine the ordinances relating to
		  this subject, and also to report whether it was best to surrender the right to
		  the State. In a few days President Swain made an elaborate report against the
		  propriety of a surrender. The Board concurred and directed the Executive
		  Committee to arrange the details of management of the University claims.</p>
          <p>The following is the system adopted in 1851: The Treasurer for the
		  time being should be the Principal Escheator, or Escheator-General. He shall
		  appoint escheators for each county, removable by the Executive Committee,
		  furnish them with blanks and all necessary information in regard to the
		  University rights, and in general exercise a strict supervision over them. He
		  shall report progress to every meeting of the Executive Committee. The county
		  escheators must make diligent inquiry as to escheated lands and examine
		  inventories, wills and settlements to ascertain if any rights have accrued to
		  the University, and report progress by October of each year. Their compensation
		  shall be ten per cent of receipts, and more if the Committee think proper. The
		  Principal Escheator shall be paid annually such sum as the Board of Trustees
		  shall deem reasonable. I give the list of the first county escheators, as it
		  shows those who were considered by the Treasurer, ex-Governor Manly, to be able
		  lawyers and friends of the University:</p>

          <p>These marked with an asterisk were Alumni of this University. In
		  consideration of the extra duties thus thrown on the Secretary and Treasurer,
		  and of the large amount of funds for which he was responsible, the Board
		  increased his salary to one thousand dollars per annum.</p>
          <p>A large escheat came to light about this time, concerning which golden
		  hopes were kindled. Soon after the Revolution began an active speculation in
		  wild lands, a rock like that on which the fortune of the great Robert Morris
		  was shattered. One David Allison, of Philadelphia, turned his attention to our
		  mountains and bought from the State an immense area in Buncombe, Henderson, and
		  Haywood. He died without heirs, and the University laid claim to his interests.
		  The heirs of Robert Love contested the claim, and after much negotiation, in
		  the course of which a settlement made by the University attorney was repudiated
		  as having been made under false pretenses, a compromise was effected by
		  President Swain as special attorney by which the litigating parties became
		  tenants in common of thousands of acres, the number of which was totally
		  unknown. When after the war this, among other parts of the University property,
		  was sold under decree of the Circuit Court of the United States, the price of
		  its share of these lands was about $13,000. By a survey ordered by the
		  court the tract contained about 70,000 acres whereas the Trustees supposed it
		  to be about 10,000 acres. The purchaser resold at a large profit—over
		  thrice what he paid.</p>
          <p>In 1852 from alleged desire to help the public schools, escheats were
		  transferred by the General Assembly from the <pb xml:id="p624" n="624"/>University
		  to them. Soon afterwards the friends of the University rallied and procured the
		  repeal of the act. It was once supposed that the gift of escheats by the
		  Charter of 1789 was a contract and could not be broken, but the Supreme Court
		  decided that the University was a part of the State, and subject to the
		  legislative power. There has been no further attempt of a similar nature, but
		  on the other hand the value of the franchise is year by year growing less.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1851.</head>
          <p>About this time the University began to increase in numbers, and
		  additional instructors were needed. In 1850 Kemp P. Battle was added as a Tutor
		  of Mathematics, and the next year William H. Johnston, of Tarboro, as Tutor of
		  Ancient Languages. In 1852 Richard Hines was made Tutor in the same
		  department.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1851 the new Professor of Rhetoric and Logic,
		  Rev. Dr. Wheat, preached the sermon to the Graduating Class. It was highly
		  praised. Rev. Dr. Hubbard before the Historical Society read a valuable paper
		  on the Historians of North Carolina, and in lieu of the address before the
		  Alumni, President Swain spoke on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution.</p>
          <p>The Freshman competitors were H. Sylvester Gibbs, Leonidas J. Merritt,
		  W. LaFayette Scott, James C. Moore, Samuel S. Jackson, Jr., Thomas N. Crumpler,
		  Richard B. Henderson, John B. Andrews, and Malachi Haughton.</p>
          <p>Those of the Sophomore Class were John T. Taylor, Spencer A. O'Daniel,
		  David G. Worth, J. Irving Scales, John W. Johnston, James H. Whitaker, J. Glenn
		  Jeffreys, Baldy A. Capehart, James M. Spencer, Peter A. McEachin.</p>
          <p>Of the Freshmen, Gibbs, Crumpler, Henderson, and Haughton did not
		  remain for graduation. All these became useful citizens. Crumpler was a lawyer,
		  member of the Legislature, an eloquent speaker, killed in battle, having become
		  a Major.</p>
          <p>The first honor in the Senior Class was awarded to Bartholomew Fuller,
		  Benjamin S. Hedrick, James A. Patton, and Claudius B. Saunders. The second to
		  Thomas A. E. Evans, Thomas M. Garrett, Jesse H. Lindsay, Jr., Malcolm J.
		  McDuffie, Wm. <pb xml:id="p625" n="625"/>M. Richardson, and Fred A. Toomer, and the
		  third to David M. Carter, B. W. Leigh Claiborne, Julius Guion, Neill McKay,
		  Jr., and Lowndes Treadwell.</p>
          <p>The orations were as follows:</p>
          <p>The Latin Salutatory, Claudius B. Sanders.</p>
          <p>“The Early History of North Carolina,” Bartholomew
		  Fuller.</p>
          <p>“Party Spirit,” Thomas A. E. Evans.</p>
          <p>“Infirmities of Men of Genius,” Benj. S. Guion.</p>
          <p>“The Graduates' Aspirations,” Wm. M. Richardson.</p>
          <p>“Virtue Alone Makes Men Free,” Thomas M. Garrett.</p>

          <p>Following the honor men in after life we find Sanders a lawyer, State

		  candidate of the Democratic party for Judge of the Superior Court; Hendrick,
		  Professor in the University and expert chemist in the Patent office; Patton a
		  lawyer, Lieutenant C. S. A.</p>
          <p>Of the others Carter was a very prominent lawyer, a leader in the
		  Legislature, Colonel C. S. A., and Judge of the Military Court, of great
		  natural ability. Of those not in the honor rank Samuel A. Holmes was a Judge of
		  the Superior Court in California; Francis E. Shober, a Representative in
		  Congress, Chief Clerk of the United States Senate, and State Senator. Peter E.
		  Smith was an ingenious Civil Engineer, and Super-intendent of the building of
		  the Ram Albemarle.</p>
          <p>Of the contemporaneous matriculates not graduating, Theodore B.
		  Kingsbury is an eminent journalist, of conspicuous power as a writer and a
		  critic. George Burgwin Anderson, a <pb xml:id="p626" n="626"/>graduate of West
		  Point, Lieutenant in the U. S. Army, Brigadier-General C. S. A., mortally
		  wounded at Sharpsburg.</p>
          <p>In this year Cameron Avenue was extended through the University Forest
		  westward, the new street called by the Village Commissioners College Avenue.
		  The lots on the same were offered for sale. Professor Hubbard in 1851 induced
		  the Trustees to set apart the lot at the corner of this avenue and Pittsboro
		  street for his occupancy, and to build a dwelling house thereon, to be repaid
		  by annual installments of $300 besides the interest. The house cost
		  $2,541, being $541 more than the estimate. Very little of this
		  was ever repaid, and the Trustees about 1869, when Dr. Pool was President, sold
		  the premises for $1,200, village property being greatly depressed.</p>
          <p>Another event of 1851 was the delivery of a Thanksgiving Sermon by Dr.
		  Hubbard at the request of the Faculty and the students. He was a polished, able
		  and interesting preacher. A forward step was resolved upon by the Trustees that
		  the Library should be increased. The sum of $1,000 yearly was placed at
		  the disposal of the President, but none of it was ever spent.</p>
          <p>The list of the matriculates of 1851 who lost their lives in the great
		  war is as follows: Wm. L. Alexander, Captain; William Bailey, Captain; Henry L.
		  Battle, Private; Richard Bradford, Captain; Wm. H. Bunn, Captain; John S.
		  Chambers, Lieutenant; Thomas Newton Crumpler, Major; James H. Fitts, Private;
		  Richard H. Glaze, Private; John M. Mickle, Captain; James C. Moore,
		  Lieutenant-Colonel; Theophilus Perry, Major; Peter P. Scales, Captain; Maurice
		  T. Smith, Lieutenant-Colonel; Thomas McG. Smith, Major; Peter E. Spruill,
		  Private; Owen A. Waddell, Major; James A. Wright, Captain.</p>
          <p>There was a notable breach of order during the night of February 20th,
		  1851. The walls of the belfry, and a week after, the doors of the recitation
		  rooms were decorated with caricatures of the Faculty, mostly amusing. Gunpowder
		  was exploded at the door of the laboratory, breaking the door and many glass
		  articles within the room. An organized party, blowing horns and ringing bells,
		  singing and shouting, “created <pb xml:id="p627" n="627"/>an uproar about the
		  professors' houses and assaulted one of them with stones.” The Faculty in
		  a body visited all the rooms; twenty-one of the absentees were summoned for
		  inquiry, and their answers recorded and read to them. Ten were found guilty and
		  dismissed. The President addressed them “in a most solemn manner about
		  their past conduct and the precaution to be observed in their present
		  situation.” “The Professors and Tutors immediately afterwards
		  repaired to the house of Professor Phillips and wrote the necessary letters to
		  the parents of those who were dismissed.”</p>
          <p>The total suspensions for the year were seven, of dismissions
		  thirteen, of expulsions one. All except the latter were afterwards
		  readmitted.</p>
          <p>The total number of delinquencies for which summoning before the
		  Faculty was deemed necessary was 282 for 230 students. Of course some students
		  were called up many times. A large majority were perfectly orderly. The records
		  seem to show that if ten or a dozen had been rigidly excluded, disorder would
		  have ceased, but on the other hand many rule-breakers became valuable citizens,
		  proud of their Alma Mater and her strong supporters.</p>

          <p>The honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity was conferred on Rev. Wm.

          <p>At the Commencement of 1852 Hon. Thomas Samuel Ashe, of the Class of
		  1832, was the orator. He was a distinguished lawyer, and held the office of
		  Solicitor of his Judicial Circuit. He was afterwards member of the Confederate
		  House and Senate, a Representative in the United States Congress, and Justice
		  of the Supreme Court of the State. As was expected, his oration on the
		  Relations of Knowledge abounded in wise suggestions, which had all the more
		  weight on account of the loftiness of his character. There was no Alumni orator
		  provided. <pb xml:id="p628" n="628"/>Those who died during the year were
		  ex-Governor Richard Dobbs Spaight, 1815; Rev. Junius B. King, 1833; Henry I.
		  Toole, Esq., 1828; Rev. Daniel B. Currie, 1840; Joseph W. Small, 1850.</p>
          <p>There was reported $840.29 collected for the Caldwell monument
		  fund. Circulars were ordered to be sent to absent alumni requesting additional
		  subscriptions.</p>
          <p>The President, John M. Morehead, was flanked on the rostrum, while
		  presiding, by President Swain and ex-Governor John Branch, the latter being in
		  attendance on the semi-<choice><sic>centenial</sic><corr>centennial</corr></choice>anniversary of
		  his graduation, and the former having matriculated in 1821.</p>
          <p>The first distinction in the Senior Class was awarded to Thomas H.
		  Gilliam, John Bernard Gretter, Leonidas F. Siler, and Jeremiah J. Slade. The
		  second honor went to George A. Brett, John L. Dismukes, Alexander R. Smith, and
		  James W. Wilson; the third to Edward Alston, Jr., Robert L. Beall, Richard H.
		  Lewis, James A. McNeill, and Nathan Newby.</p>
          <p>It was reported that Rev. S. Milton Frost was first in all but
		  Mathematics, and James F. Bell was first in the Senior year. The only perfectly
		  regular man for four years was J. J. Slade.</p>
          <p>Of those of the first honor Gilliam was a promising lawyer, but died
		  early; Gretter had great natural ability, but lacked ambition. He was a
		  railroad Passenger Agent. Siler had uncommon weight of character, was a lawyer
		  and then a Methodist minister; Slade was a Captain C. S. A., and is head of a
		  Female School.</p>
          <p>Of the others Wilson was an eminent Civil Engineer, President of the
		  Western North Carolina Railroad Company, and then of the North Carolina
		  Railroad Commission; Dismukes a Surgeon C. S. A., author of a medical work, and
		  President of the Kentucky Medical Association.</p>
          <p>Of contemporaneous matriculates, not graduating, Flavillus S. Goode
		  was a Captain C. S. A., member of the Legislature of Louisiana, Presidential
		  Elector, Attorney-General, and Judge of the Superior Court; Joseph H. Baker was
		  a Surgeon C. S. A., a member of the Legislature and of the Convention of
		  1868.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p629" n="629"/>
          <p>Of the Senior speakers the Valedictory, by Leonidas F. Siler, was
		  pronounced worthy of praise. Gretter's on the “Bubble Reputation”
		  was considered the best—epigrammatic, full of antithesis and paradox,
		  interspersed with severe truth. Warner Lewis' oration on Webster was full of
		  sincerity and truth. These comments were by the newspaper correspondents,
		  doubtless correct, but probably doing injustice by omission. The other speakers
		  were:</p>
          <p>Salutatory in Latin,” by Gilliam.</p>
          <p>“The Yadkin,” by Beall.</p>
          <p>“Moral Courage,” by Lewis.</p>
          <p>“The Political State of Europe,” by McNeill.</p>
          <p>“Government's First Duty is to Its Citizens,” by

          <p>“Oliver Cromwell,” by Wilson.</p>
          <p>“Mystery No Ground for Misbelief,” by Newby.</p>
          <p>“Agriculture Aided by Legislation,” by Smith.</p>
          <p>“Et Brevi Spatio, Spem Longam Reseces,” by Dismukes.</p>
          <p>The Baccalaureate Sermon was by one of the graduates, Rev. S. Milton
		  Frost. His theme was Ambition, as illustrated by the career of Daniel. It was
		  handled in a manner fresh and vigorous, and gained for him a marked reputation
		  as a pulpit orator.</p>
          <p>Of the Freshman Declaimers O. R. Waddell was considered the best, and
		  W. H. Hall, J. R. Hogan, Jesse Averitt and Peter E. Spruill the next. Of the
		  Sophomores Joseph A. Engelhard carried off the palm. His subject was the Death
		  of Absalom.</p>
          <p>There was no music except for the dancing at night, furnished by the
		  Ball Managers, it being the custom for the Marshals to raise the money to pay
		  the Commencement band, who played in the intervals of the speaking, and as will
		  be seen there were no Marshals. The correspondent also noted that there was no
		  unpleasant ordering of visitors from one seat to another as he had seen a year
		  ago. This criticism of the Marshals of the preceding year is unjust. Certain
		  seats had been reserved for the Graduating Class, as was usual and proper. The
		  Marshals insisted that the arrangement should <pb xml:id="p630" n="630"/>be carried
		  out. The Seniors could not do honor to their valedictorian, nor march up to
		  receive their diplomas “decently and in order” unless they sat in a
		  body. Visitors should not be willing to crowd them out. The Marshals were more
		  apt to err on the side of politeness than of harshness. They greatly desired a
		  large attendance of happy people.</p>
          <p>The Degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on Commodore Matthew F.
		  Maury, and of Doctor of Divinity on Rev. Alexander Lacy and Rev. Moses A.
		  Curtis.</p>
          <p>The matriculates of 1852 who lost their lives in the Civil War were:
		  William Adams, Captain; George A. Baxter, Captain; Owen N. Brown, Major; Thomas
		  S. Crump, Private; Francis D. Foxhall, Lieutenant; Robert E. James, Sergeant;
		  Daniel W. Johnson, Captain; Daniel McDougald, Captain; Duncan E. McNair,
		  Captain; Montford S. McRae, Sergeant; E. Graham Morrow, Lieutenant; William A.
		  Owens, Colonel; Stark A. Sutton, Captain; James N. Turner, Captain; Shubal G.
		  Worth, Captain.</p>
          <p>At this Commencement occurred an unpleasant difficulty with the
		  students. At the instance of the Faculty the Trustees passed an ordinance that
		  no one should represent the University who was very irregular in attention to
		  his duties. Under this the Faculty refused to allow a nominee of the Chief
		  Marshal to act as a Sub-Marshal. The students met on May 6th and passed
		  intemperate resolutions, prefacing them with a preamble asserting that they
		  were compelled to support the expenses of Commencement; should therefore have
		  the appointment of the officers. The resolutions were: First, that the Trustees
		  have most inconsiderately made the office of the Marshal and subordinates
		  “dependent on the mere whims and unjust decisions of the Faculty”;
		  second, that the Faculty have so construed the law regulating the standard of
		  punctuality as to deprive an estimable Sub-Marshal of his rights; third, that
		  unless this prohibition be withdrawn the Chief and other marshals should refuse
		  to act; fourth, that the aggrieved students refuse to submit to any officers
		  not chosen by themselves; fifth, that these resolutions be maintained with the
		  most unswerving and uncompromising fidelity.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p631" n="631"/>
          <p>The only students who opposed in full these fiery and unfair
		  utterances were A. R. Black, Alexander McIver, James Magnus Spencer, Peter E.
		  Spruill, and Leonidas Siler. Three voted for all except the first, and approved
		  of that. One voted for all except the first; three voted for only the third and
		  fourth; eleven refused to vote; twenty-four were absent; 183 supported all the
		  resolutions. After much deliberation and consultation with Professors,
		  Trustees, parents and others, there was a change of opinion. On the 21st of May
		  another meeting was held, and the resolutions were unanimously withdrawn. It is
		  probable that the students were persuaded to leave the question to the Board of
		  Trustees. The Board decided in favor of the Faculty and advised the Marshal,
		  Walker Meares, to appoint another assistant. Declining this, he resigned. The
		  vacancy was not filled, and the Commencement exercises, under the guidance of
		  Chief Justice Ruffin, who presided in the absence of the Governor, was had
		  without Marshals. There was a distinct air of gloom, a want of brightness and
		  gaiety apparent, but the proceedings passed off without a jar. It seemed to the
		  students that if one of their number was deemed worthy to retain his place in
		  the institution he should be eligible to a mere ministerial office which had no
		  connection with text books or punctuality. This view was strengthened by the
		  fact that the young man, who although not attentive to prayers and recitations,
		  was exceptionally well qualified by intelligence and gentlemanly manners for
		  the position to which he had been appointed. The Faculty's idea was to
		  stimulate to good behavior by such discriminations. They certainly were not
		  sustained by the younger part of the community. The Trustees six months
		  afterwards perfunctorily approved the action of the Faculty, but on motion of
		  Mr. B. F. Moore, usually a strong advocate for enforcing obedience to law,
		  repealed this regulation and left the appointment of Commencement officers
		  entirely to the students. The evils of electioneering by candidates for the
		  Marshal's place proving intolerable, in 1856 the choice was taken from the
		  students at large and given to the Senior Class, none but a Junior to be
		  eligible.</p>

          <head>UNIVERSITY MAGAZINE.</head>
          <p>In this year (1852) steps were taken to begin the publication of
		  another University Magazine. It could hardly be called the renewal of the old.
		  A meeting of the students was called. Jeremiah J. Slade, of Georgia, moved the
		  re-establishment. The motion was carried, and the Senior Class was authorized
		  to elect the first editors. Afterwards this elective function was devolved on
		  the Junior Class within a few days of Commencement. The prospectus was issued
		  in December, and the first number appeared in February, 1852. The students took
		  much interest in the enterprise, and it was necessary to reject numerous
		  articles offered. The first editors were L. F. Siler, J. J. Slade, and
		  Alexander R. Smith, of the Dialectic, and Wm. D. Barnes, Thos. B. Burton,
		  Thomas H. Gilliam of the Philanthropic. Zebulon B. Vance was an editor for a
		  few months; resigned when he procured his law license.</p>
          <p>Wm. D. Cooke, of Raleigh, was the publisher. The subscription price
		  was two dollars per annum for ten numbers. It was promised that if there should
		  be a surplus after paying the amount promised to Cooke, it should go to the
		  libraries, but there was never enough to buy a dime spelling book, although the
		  books showed over 500 subscribers. It was stated that 525 paying subscribers
		  would pay expenses. Of course many subscribers neglected to pay. It was
		  estimated that by 1856 $5,000 promised was uncollected—a manifest
		  exaggeration. Considerable cash was collected, and beyond question the editors
		  properly applied the moneys paid them. Cooke became clamorous for his
		  compensation, and by way of compromise the subscription books were turned over
		  to him. A new publisher, James M. Henderson, was found, editor of the Chapel
		  Hill Gazette, an ephemeral weekly. He was succeeded by John B. Neathery, both
		  of whom demanded their pay in advance. There was constant trouble on this
		  score. In 1859 the two Societies came to the relief of the struggling managers
		  by agreeing to make up the deficiencies. The magazine was then prosperous until
		  June, 1861. After this date few young men of the South were found in the
		  college walls. During 1860-'61 there were 376 matriculations into the
		  University. About one-fourth 
		  <figure><graphic xml:id="ill18" url="bat1-632.jpg"/><p>VIEW TAKEN 1852—SHOWING OLD BELFRY.</p><p>SOUTH BUILDING.</p></figure><pb xml:id="p633" n="633"/>returned, and the number every year
		  diminished. There was retrenchment everywhere. The magazine died.</p>
          <p>The University Magazine of 1852-'61 contained many articles of real
		  historical value, and is now much sought after by students of North Carolina
		  History. The principal authors were President D. L. Swain, Archibald M. Hooper,
		  Gen. Joseph Graham, Archibald M. Murphey, Rev. Dr. Hubbard. In some instances
		  President Swain turned over his material to an editor, especially L. F. Siler,
		  and the authorship was attributed to him. Among the most valuable of these
		  articles I enumerate: “Closing Scenes of the Revolution in North
		  Carolina,” by Gen. Joseph Graham; “First Symptoms of Independence
		  in North Carolina,” by Siler; “Sketch of the Indian War of
		  1776,” by Siler; “Civil War of 1781-'2; Colonel David
		  Fanning,” probably by Doctor Hubbard; “Memoirs of General

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1853.</head>
          <p>In 1853 the books of the University were removed from their dusty
		  shelves in the President's lecture-room in the South Building to Smith Hall.
		  Messrs. Hubbard, Charles Phillips and the Librarian were appointed to prepare a
		  catalogue for the same, which I think was never done. Here they rested until
		  they were stored in a room in the East Building at the beginning of the
		  war.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1853 was called the Hawks' Commencement because of
		  the conspicuous part taken in it by the Rev. Dr. Francis L. Hawks, of New York,
		  a graduate of 1815. On Monday night he preached the sermon to the Graduating
		  Class, which was pronounced to be able and eloquent, and particularly
		  impressive on account of his wonderful voice and oratorical grace.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p635" n="635"/>
          <p>His subsequent address before the Historical Society, a vindication of
		  Sir Walter Raleigh, was a remarkable triumph of oratory. The reporter to the
		  newspaper said truly that there was no passion in the breast, to which the
		  various arts of oratory can appeal, that was not fully aroused.</p>
          <p>At the meeting of the Alumni twenty new members were added.</p>
          <p>On motion of Dr. Hawks, the Executive Committee were instructed to
		  report at the next meeting a plan for offering and awarding prizes on literary
		  and scientific subjects to the undergraduates of the University.</p>
          <p>The Association in reply to a letter from the editors of the
		  <hi rend="italics">University Magazine,</hi>apprised them of its interest in
		  the enterprise and of the steps already taken likely to render them material
		  aid. What these steps were is not explained, but the resolution of Dr. Hawks
		  was probably meant.</p>
          <p>Obituaries of the recent dead, Thomas L. Avery, 1841; Reuben C.
		  Shorter, 1844, and John K. Strange, 1848, were read.</p>
          <p>Dr. James H. Dickson, of the Class of 1823, escorted by three of his
		  classmates, Judge Richmond M. Pearson, A. M. Scales, and Dr. James A.
		  Washington, delivered the annual address. It was pronounced to be able, learned
		  and interesting, and a copy was requested for publication on motion of
		  President Swain, seconded warmly by Dr. Hawks.</p>
          <p>The Freshmen Declaimers for 1853 were A. Haywood Merritt, William
		  Johnston Saunders, David T. Oates, E. Graham Morrow, Joseph W. Stevenson, John
		  C. Crawford, Owen N. Brown, Thomas L. Cowper, John B. Yarborough, Jerome J.
		  Hadley. On Tuesday night, on the part of the Sophomore Class, appeared Henry W.
		  McMillan, John M. Puttick, Charlton Yellowley, James H. Colton, William H.
		  Hall, Alexander D. Betts, Nathaniel A. Boyden, Robert E. James, Peter E.
		  Spruill, John R. Hogan.</p>
          <p>Of the Freshmen, Oates, Crawford, Brown, Cowper, Yarborough, Hadley,
		  left before graduation. All the Sophomores received their diplomas. Brown
		  became a Major C. S. A., and was killed in battle; Cowper died the year of his
		  appearance on the stage; Yarborough was a Confederate soldier and then
		  merchant.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p636" n="636"/>
          <p>The literary critic of the exercises was horrified at the length of
		  the extracts declaimed by the competitors, averaging, he said, fourteen
		  minutes. He thought that Peter E. Spruill was the best of the Sophomores, and
		  that E. Graham Morrow and Owen N. Brown the best of the Freshmen.</p>
          <p>The Marshals won praise by their masterly performance of duty.
		  Directed by the Ball Managers, the dancing was abundant and orderly, the music
		  excellent; the speeches of the Seniors, and Declamations of the competitors
		  very respectable, and the addresses by the eminent orators beyond all
		  praise.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) was conferred upon
		  Judges Walker Anderson, Frederick Nash, Richmond M. Pearson, and William H.
		  Battle, the first of the Supreme Court of Florida, the others of the Supreme
		  Court of North Carolina. The degree of Doctor of Divinity was given to Rev.
		  Joseph Cross, a prominent Methodist minister and author of sacred books; Rev.
		  Cyrus Johnston, a Presbyterian divine, and Bishop Thomas F. Davis, of South
		  Carolina, a graduate of 1822.</p>
          <p>The first distinction in the Senior class of sixty members, the
		  largest to date, was awarded to Archibald R. Black, Alexander W. Lawrence,
		  Alexander McIver, Alfred G. Merritt, John L. Morehead, James M. Spencer, and
		  George M. White.</p>
          <p>The second to Vine A. Allen, Robert A. Chambers, Benjamin T. Green,
		  Cyrus Harrington, Hugh G. Livingston, Solomon Pool, Wm. H. Powell, James Woods,
		  and David G. Worth.</p>
          <p>The third to William H. Battle, Jr., James M. Bullock, Thomas T.
		  Dismukes, Thomas C. Ferebee, Wm. W. Peebles, N. Eldridge Scales, Junius Irving
		  Scales.</p>
          <p>The next best scholars were Du Brutz Cutlar, John C. Stickney, John T.
		  Taylor, Daniel McN. McKay, John A. McKay. Bullock, Ferebee, D. McN. McKay and
		  V. E. Scales never missed a duty in four years, 4,800 attendances.</p>
          <p>I give a succinct history of the chief honor men, so far as I have
		  traced them. Black was a good teacher and Sheriff of Pender; Lawrence Assistant
		  in the National Observatory, came South, and was a Confederate Captain; McIver,
		  Professor of Mathematics at Davidson College and (1869-70) of
		  <pb xml:id="p637" n="637"/>the University, then State Superintendent of Public
		  Instruction; Merritt was in the Confederate service, then a Judge in Tennessee;
		  Morehead a wealthy capitalist, and director of railroads; Spencer a lawyer of
		  great promise, but died early; White a lawyer, also died early.</p>
          <p>Of the others Pool was Adjunct Professor of Mathematics in the
		  University, and President thereof 1869-1874, also a Methodist minister; Worth,
		  a prosperous commission merchant, and a liberal donor to the University; Junius
		  I. Scales, a Colonel C. S. A., a leader of the bar and the General Assembly;
		  John W. Moore, author of a two-volume history of North Carolina; Shorter,
		  Chairman of the Railroad Commission of Alabama; John D. Taylor, a member of the
		  Legislature, Colonel, losing an arm in battle, and now Superior Court Clerk;
		  Woods was of brilliant parts, but cut off in early youth.</p>
          <p>Among the matriculates not graduating was Alfred Moore Waddell, a
		  Lieutenant-Colonel, a Representative in Congress, Mayor of Wilmington, author
		  of “A Colonial Officer,” and many other historical monographs, and
		  a polished orator. Junius B. Wheeler entered at West Point, where he graduated,
		  became a Major U. S. A., and Professor of Engineering in the U. S. Military
		  Academy; Thomas M. Holt, a large manufacturer, Speaker of the House of
		  Representatives, Lieutenant Governor, and then Governor of the State; John H.
		  Morehead, Colonel, killed at Gettysburg; Frederick N. Strudwick, State
		  Solicitor and Presidential Elector; William Strudwick, an eminent
		  physician.</p>
          <p>The matriculates who lost their lives in the Civil War were: John
		  Anthony, Corporal; Thomas O. Closs, Captain; Andrew J. Flanner, Private; Hugh
		  W. Gardner, Private; James W. Horne, Sergeant; Thomas R. Long, Private; Wm. A.
		  Lord, Private; John W. Mayfield, Lieutenant; George T. Morgan, Private; Henry
		  Mullins, Captain; John D. Rankin, Sergeant; Edwin S. Sanders, Captain; William
		  E. Wilson, Private.</p>
          <p>The Ball Managers directed the dances and provided for the supper with
		  all possible grace and efficiency. Their names were E. H. Davis, Chief, and W.
		  C. Nichols, C. W. Phifer, J. W. Sanford, R. M. Sloan, and W. H. Spencer.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p638" n="638"/>
          <p>In 1853 the Secretary and Treasurer, Charles Manly, made to the Board
		  a history of his office. The first Treasurer, he said, was Walter Alves, son of
		  James Hogg, one of the earliest Trustees, and himself a Trustee. Then came
		  Robert Williams, a Brigadier-General of militia, succeeded by himself, who held
		  the office for forty-four years. For sixty-four years Daniel Dupree, the Clerk
		  of the State Bank, had posted the books in journal and ledger, being paid by
		  the Treasurer.</p>
          <p>Governor Manly was slightly mistaken in his list of Treasurers. John
		  Craven preceded, and Galvin Alves succeeded Walter Alves.</p>
          <p>In 1854 President Swain delivered before the General Assembly an
		  address on the history and work of the University. It was thought to be so able
		  that one thousand copies were printed by the Faculty for distribution.</p>
          <p>Applicants for admission into the Freshman Class were required to
		  stand examination through equations of the second degree in Algebra. To insure
		  thorough instruction the two As Gerrard Hall could not be heated, there was
		  shivering to each.</p>
          <p>The graduates of Yale College of 1813 held a reunion on their 40th
		  anniversary. Dr. Mitchell applied for and obtained permission to meet his
		  classmates.</p>

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1854.</head>
          <p>The Commencement of 1854 was afflicted by rain and cold, so that fires
		  were necessary. Ladies with thin and low-necked dresses suffered severely.
		  There was no moonlight rambling. As Gerrard Hall could not be heated, there was
		  shivering discomfort among old and young, small and great.</p>
          <p>The journalistic critic reported that the extracts chosen by the
		  Declaimers of the Freshman and Sophomore Classes were too tame and too long. If
		  a good thing cannot be said in five minutes it cannot be in five years. The
		  same is true in regard to the original addresses of the Seniors.</p>
          <p>The Declaimers were as follows:</p>
          <p>Sophomores—William Bingham, Henry R. Bryan, William H. Burwell,
		  Clement Dowd, Solomon P. Green, Daniel W. <pb xml:id="p639" n="639"/>Johnson, A.
		  Haywood Merritt, E. Graham Morrow, Joseph W. Stephenson, Stuart White.</p>
          <p>Freshmen—John Anthony, Andrew J. Manner, George H. Gregory, Wm.
		  H. Hayley, Wm. H. Jordan, Henry Mullins, Henry C. Thompson, John H.
		  <choice><sic>Tillingshast</sic><corr>Tillinghast</corr></choice>, Nathan P. Ward, John E.
		  Wharton.</p>
          <p>One correspondent gave special praise to Gregory, Hayley, and
		  Tillinghast; another to Bingham, Johnson, Saunders, and White.</p>
          <p>All these speakers remained until they received their diplomas, except
		  Tillinghast. He was chaplain in the Confederate Army, and is an Episcopal
		  minister.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday there was an examination of the Senior Class in
		  Constitutional and International Law. The sermon before the Graduating Class
		  was delivered by Rev. Thomas G. Lowe, of the Methodist Church. There was
		  disappointment that the preacher did not indulge in the impassioned flights of
		  eloquence for which he had high reputation, but the discourse was full of
		  religious fervor and sound instruction.</p>
          <p>The Literary Address was by ex-Governor Aaron V. Brown, of Tennessee,
		  of the Class of 1814, once Representative in Congress, and soon to be
		  Postmaster-General. His theme, Encouragement to Students from the Future
		  Prospects of our Country, was ably handled.</p>
          <p>There were before him ex-Governors Branch, Swain, Morehead, Graham,
		  Manly, and Reid.</p>
          <p>As they had been accustomed for several years, the Alumni then formed
		  in the order of their classes in order to march to Smith Hall, their place of
		  meeting. It was stated that one of the Class of 1799, Dr. W. S. Webb, and one,
		  a citizen of Texas, of the Class of 1800, Dr. Thomas Hunt, still lived, but
		  were not present. Ex-Governor Branch answered for that of 1801. Of the seven
		  ex-Governors present, two were or had been Federal Senators and Secretaries of
		  the Navy; two had been Ministers to Spain, and two Judges of the Supreme Court.
		  There was no public speaking on behalf of the Alumni, no graduate of the Class
		  of 1824 having been secured, according to the thirty years rule prescribed by
		  the Association.</p>
          <p>Among the sixty members of the Senior Class of 1854, the
		  <pb xml:id="p640" n="640"/>first honor was awarded to Wm. L. Alexander, William
		  Badham, Jr., Richard H. Battle, Jr., John W. Graves, Samuel S. Jackson, Jr.,
		  Wm. LaFayette Scott, and Wm. R. Wetmore.</p>
          <p>The second to John H. M. Bullock, John M. Gallaway, Robert B.
		  Johnston, Willam S. Long, Leonidas J. Merritt, Oscar R. Rand, David G. Robeson,
		  John K. Ruffin, Enoch J. Vann, and James A. Wright.</p>
          <p>The third honor to Richard Bradford, Joseph A. Engelhard, John M.
		  Morrison, William Lawrence Saunders, John D. Shaw, Wm. H. Spencer, Bryan
		  Whitfield, and Theodore Whitfield.</p>
          <p>John M. Andrews, Richard H. Battle, John W. Graves and Wm. L. Scott
		  were reported as having been perfectly punctual for four years.</p>
          <p>As the honor men numbered twenty-five, it was resolved to limit the
		  number of speeches on Commencement Day to twenty. The Valedictory and Latin
		  Salutatory were as usual drawn for by the first honor men.</p>
          <p>The programme was as follows:</p>
          <p>The Salutatory, Wm. Badham.</p>
          <p>“Greeting to Our Friends,” John D. Shaw.</p>
          <p>“Science in the Bible,” James Mangus Spencer.</p>

          <p>“Where Are We?” Joseph Engelhard.</p>
          <p>The Valedictory, Wm. L. Scott.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p641" n="641"/>
          <p>The correspondent reported that the orations of Battle, Jackson,
		  Johnston, Merritt, and Whitfield were received with marked commendation.</p>
          <p>Of the first honor men Alexander, Badham and Graves became lawyers and
		  Captains C. S. A., Alexander dying of wounds received in service.</p>
          <p>Scott, likewise a lawyer, was Lieutenant-Colonel; Battle, after being
		  Tutor in the University, served as Lieutenant and Quartermaster in the
		  Confederate Army, with the rank of Captain, was State Auditor, and for years,
		  having refused a Judgeship, has been among the leaders of the Raleigh bar;
		  Jackson was a Tutor in the University and an able lawyer; Wetmore a devoted and
		  useful minister of the Episcopal Church, a Doctor of Divinity.</p>
          <p>Of the others, Gallaway was in the Legislature of Tennessee and North
		  Carolina, a Colonel of Cavalry, and is a farmer and Bank President; Vann a
		  Judge in Florida; Engelhard a lawyer, journalist, Adjutant of Brigade, with
		  rank of Major, and Secretary of State; William L. Saunders a lawyer, Editor of
		  the Colonial Records, and author of Prefatory Notes to each volume; Theodore
		  Whitfield a Doctor of Divinity in the Baptist Church.</p>
          <p>Of those receiving no honors Needham B. Cobb was a Doctor of Divinity
		  in the Baptist Church; William C. Nichols a Surgeon, Editor and City Physician
		  of New Orleans; Phifer in the United States Army, and then a Brigadier-General
		  in the Confederate Army.</p>
          <p>The Confederate dead roll of the matriculates was as follows: Robert
		  L. Allen, Private; John W. Ballard, Captain; Jesse S. Barnes, Captain; Edward
		  S. J. Bell, Lieutenant; Hugh T. Brown, Captain; Thomas Cowan, Jr., Captain;
		  John L. Fuller, Private; William H. Gibson, Lieutenant; Frederick H. Jenkins,
		  Captain; James B. Jordan, Private; William C. Lord, Captain; William B.
		  McKinnon, Private; Julius A. Robbins, Captain; William H. Whitaker, Private;
		  David J. Young, Private.</p>
          <p>In December, 1854, the North Carolina Railroad was finished to Durham,
		  then and for some time afterwards called “Durham's Station.” The
		  authorities of the road gave a free <pb xml:id="p642" n="642"/>ride to the members
		  of the Legislature and their friends. By the kindness of Hon. Samuel F.
		  Phillips, a Commoner from Orange, I was of the company. There was only one
		  residence in the place, that of Dr. Bart. A. Durham, once a member of the
		  Legislature. Such was the abundance of game in that day that the breakfast
		  table had enough and to spare of hot broiled partridges for the goodly number
		  present.</p>
          <p>There was no speaking or other ceremony, but the Legislators present
		  had pleasant converse for awhile with the neighbors, and then the major part
		  took stages and journeyed westward to their homes. There being no conveyance to
		  Chapel Hill, my journey was on foot, three hours for the twelve miles. From
		  that day until the completion of the branch railroad in 1882, the Chapel Hill
		  and Durham two-horse line superseded the four-horse stage line to Raleigh. Dr.
		  Durham's plantation is the growing city of Durham.</p>
          <p>In pursuance of a resolution of the Board adopted in 1852, on the
		  first of January, 1854, began the School for the Application of Science to the
		  Arts. The instructions were intended to prepare for professional life,
		  Engineers, Artisans, Chemists, Farmers, Miners and Physicians. While the
		  students had opportunities given for practical work, the chief attention was
		  given to the study of the theories, which Science presents as applicable to the
		  Arts.</p>
          <p>Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts could substitute Civil
		  Engineering or Agricultural Chemistry for the Ancient and Modern Languages, or
		  for International and Constitutional Law, during the second term of the Senior
		  year. They could get the diploma of A.B. with the other graduates, and in one
		  year more, exclusively devoted to the new department, obtain the degree of
		  Master of Arts. Those who were connected with the University only as pupils of
		  this school as a rule completed their course in two and one-half years, and
		  obtained the degree of Bachelor of Science (B.S.) They were subject to all the
		  rules as to attendance on Public Worship, Prayers, Recitations and discipline,
		  to the same extent as other students.</p>
          <p>The new school was divided into the Departments of Civil
		  <pb xml:id="p643" n="643"/>Engineering, and that for the application of Chemistry
		  to Agriculture and the Arts. Those entering the Engineering Department were
		  expected to have a fair familiarity with Algebra and Geometry, and with Plane
		  and Spherical Trigonometry, together with its applications. Church's Analytical
		  Geometry, Church's Calculus, Davies' Descriptive Geometry and Davies' Shades
		  and Shadows were studied the first year. In the second, Smith's Mechanics and
		  Engineering, Mahan's Civil Engineering, Gillespie's Roads and Railroads,
		  Troutwine, Borden, Long, etc., on Geodesy and Earth Works. In the third year
		  attention was given to the application of Science to various constructive Arts
		  and reviews of previous studies. Mechanical, Topographical and Architectural
		  Drawing, plain and isometrical, were taught throughout the course, and also the
		  theories of the construction and adjustment of instruments, together with their
		  use in the field. Besides the foregoing, the pupils pursued such work in
		  Chemistry and in the Academic Department as was necessary to the ends they had
		  in view.</p>
          <p>Rev. Charles Phillips, who had distinguished himself as Tutor of
		  Mathematics, was elected Professor of Civil Engineering, and was given a year
		  for special study. He selected Harvard University.</p>
          <p>In the Department of the application of Chemistry to Agriculture and
		  the Arts, students were promised instruction in Analytical Chemistry and its
		  application to the analysis of soils, manures and mineral waters, the assaying
		  of ores and minerals, the testing of drugs and medicines. A laboratory was
		  fitted up in the basement of Smith Hall, and was open every day in the week.
		  Recitations and Lectures on the Chemistry of Agriculture were given. The
		  text-books for reading and reference were Noad's Chemical Analysis, Rose's
		  Analytical Chemistry, Regnault's Chemistry, Johnson's Agricultural Chemistry,
		  Stockhardt's Field Lectures, Plattner's Testing with the Blowpipe, Bowman's
		  Medical Chemistry.</p>
          <p>Benjamin Sherwood Hedrick, a first honor graduate of the Class of
		  1851, and one of the ablest mathematicians the University has had, who had
		  pursued his studies in Chemistry in the laboratory of Harvard University, was
		  placed at the head of this new department.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p644" n="644"/>
          <p>The names of the students under Professor Phillips and Hedrick were
		  not printed until 1856. In that year they were forty-four in number; in 1857
		  sixty-nine, and so on, most of them already students of the University,
		  candidates for Bachelor of Arts.</p>
          <p>A native Frenchman, Henri Herrisse, a scholarly young man, was
		  appointed Instructor in French. Solomon Pool, A.B., 1853, was added as Tutor of
		  Mathematics, and Joseph B. Lucas, of the Class of 1849, as Tutor of Ancient
		  Languages.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on John Randolph Clay, of
		  Philadelphia, and of Doctor of Divinity on Rev. Eli W. Caruthers and Rev.
		  Aldert Smedes, both of North Carolina. Clay was Secretary of Legation at
		  Vienna, then Chargé d'Affaires to Russia, and Minister Plenipotentiary
		  to Peru. Smedes was Principal of the flourishing St. Mary's School at Raleigh,
		  and Caruthers Presbyterian minister in Alamance, and author of two volumes of
		  Revolutionary History.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>INCREASE OF NUMBERS—LAWS REVISED.</head>
          <p>The number of students increased rapidly after the middle of the
		  century for several reasons: the increase of prosperity of the cotton-growing
		  States, the extension of railroads, the want of public confidence in colleges
		  South of our State. Moreover many planters who had left our State for the
		  cheaper and richer lands of the Gulf States had a natural desire that their
		  sons should finish their education in the State of their old home. The
		  following figures show the extent of the movement: The matriculates for the ten
		  years 1840 to 1850 were 1,602, averaging 160 per annum. From 1850 to 1860 they
		  were 3,480, averaging 348 per annum; for the five years 1850 to 1855 the number
		  was 1,344, or 269 per annum; for the five years 1855 to 1860 it was 2,736,
		  averaging 427. To form some idea of the patronage from other States, I take at
		  random the year of the largest attendance. There were 460, including four law
		  students not counted in the catalogue. Of these 282 were from North Carolina,
		  leaving 178 from other States, over one-third of the whole. Tennessee furnished
		  the <pb xml:id="p645" n="645"/>largest number, 39. Then came Louisiana, Mississippi
		  and Alabama with 28, 26 and 21, respectively. South Carolina and Texas
		  furnished 15, Georgia 14, Virginia only eight. There were four each from
		  Kentucky and Florida, two from Arkansas and one each from New York and Iowa.
		  Contrast this with 620 in the catalogue of 1903-4, of whom 565 are from North
		  Carolina, only 55 are from beyond our limits, about one in eleven. Tennessee
		  now sends not one, nor do Alabama or Mississippi. Louisiana has only two, South
		  Carolina has 17, but Texas only one. Most of the Southern States have
		  universities and colleges satisfactory to themselves.</p>
          <p>The continued increase in the number of students necessitated new
		  buildings for dormitories, lecture rooms, and for halls for the two Societies.
		  In 1856 a plan of extending the Old East and West Buildings was adopted, but
		  this was abandoned.</p>
          <p>The Revised Code of 1855 strengthened the acts of 1824 and 1827, in
		  regard to the University, the substance of them being as follows:</p>
          <p>License to retail spirituous or vinous liquors within two miles of
		  Chapel Hill was prohibited. This limit extended nearly three miles from the
		  dormitories. It is now four miles from the town limits. The prohibition applies
		  to the selling by the drink or measure less than a quart.</p>
          <p>The second section forbids within two miles all houses for the sale in
		  any quantity of spirituous, vinous or malt liquors.</p>
          <p>The third section forbids the selling or giving to any student or
		  other person any cordial, wine, spirituous or malt liquor, with the intent that
		  the same shall be used within two miles of Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The fourth prohibits electioneering treats within said limits.</p>
          <p>By the fifth section public billiard tables or other public tables for
		  playing games of chance or skill are forbidden within five miles of Chapel
		  Hill. By the sixth are forbidden within the same limits theatricals, sleight of
		  hand or equestrian performances, dramatic representation or recitations, rope
		  or wire dancing, natural or artificial curiosities, or any concert, serenade,
		  <pb xml:id="p646" n="646"/>or performances in music, singing or dancing, without
		  the written permission of the President or member of the Faculty, given in
		  writing seven days beforehand.</p>
          <p>Seventhly. Offences against the preceding provisions shall be
		  misdemeanors.</p>
          <p>The eighth section declares void all contracts with shop-keepers,
		  merchants, traders or other persons, including livery stable keepers, by
		  students, if made within two miles of Chapel Hill, without the written
		  permission of the President or some member of the Faculty; if without the two
		  miles limit, the written permission of the person having control and authority
		  over such students.</p>
          <p>By the ninth section contracts contrary to the foregoing provisions
		  may be avoided on plea of the general issue, and the fact of being a student
		  raised the presumption that the defendant was a minor.</p>
          <p>By the tenth section such contracts were made incapable of being
		  confirmed by the student after reaching full age.</p>
          <p>The eleventh section restored to the University escheated real
		  estate.</p>
          <p>As to the practical workings of these laws, it may be said that while
		  there were no “grogshops” within the prohibited limits, there were
		  some at no great distance outside, and while intoxicating liquors could not be
		  openly bought, there were abundant underground streams which could be and were
		  easily tapped by those who had money and inclination. The suppression of liquor
		  shops, made first in 1827, was of great advantage in rendering drinking less
		  common and less scandalous, and the danger of collisions between drunken
		  students and still more drunken non-students was lessened. The law in regard to
		  gaming tables and circuses and other performances passed in 1794 was well
		  enforced. It was strengthened in regard to dramatic and other diversions by
		  there being no suitable hall in the village, and the refusal of the Faculty of
		  the use of the Gerrard Hall. Nothing however could prevent surreptitious
		  excursions to Hillsboro and other places, even as far as Raleigh. Frequently
		  seekers after pleasure would ride horseback twenty-eight miles to the
		  metropolis, witness <pb xml:id="p647" n="647"/>the entrancing circus or drama and
		  answer to their names in the Chapel by sunrise, after an absence of little over
		  twelve hours and a ride over an execrable road of fifty-six miles.</p>
          <p>Copies of the laws were sent to the merchants of Chapel Hill and other
		  places. Once when a Raleigh merchant sent whiskey to Chapel Hill for sale, a
		  general warning was sent to all, whereat there was much indignation in the
		  breasts of the innocent, who contended that there was timid sheltering of the
		  guilty.</p>
          <p>The attention of the merchants of Chapel Hill having been called to
		  these laws, they met and agreed not to sell to students under age on credit,
		  without permission in writing from their parent or guardian. The obligation was
		  not to be binding without the concurrence of the Faculty of the University, and
		  was to continue eighteen months. The following were the signers, being a large
		  majority of the merchants of the village: Richard B. Saunders, J. R. Hutchins
		  &amp; Co., C. Scott &amp; Co., J. T. Hogan &amp; Co., Long and McCauley, Walter
		  A. Thompson, F. A. Davies, H. L. Owen, John W. Carr.</p>
          <p>Andrew Mickle, President of the meeting, and George M. Long,
		  Secretary, approved its action and the Faculty, on their part, did
		  likewise.</p>

          <head>THE BAPTIST CHURCH.</head>
          <p>The Baptist Church was organized in Chapel Hill on September 15th,
		  1854. The building was dedicated May 6th, 1855. The most generous benefactor
		  was Elder William Henry Merritt, who was the owner of the mill and plantation
		  now called Purefoy's. The flour of this mill had a wide reputation in the days
		  before the railroads came. Elder Merritt donated the lot on which are the
		  church edifices, and $1,200 in money. Elder George W. Purefoy, D.D., was
		  Chairman of the Building Committee, and Elder J. J. James preached the
		  dedicatory sermon. The first pastor was Elder Brantley Jones Hackney.</p>

		  sermon to the Graduating <pb xml:id="p648" n="648"/>Class. The audience generally
		  agreed that it was learned, eloquent, impressive, beautiful, but some of the

		  true.</p>

		  White, Wm. M. Coleman, Leroy M. McAfee, Reuell M. Stancill, Gilmer, Coleman,
		  McAfee, Barnes, and Wright won the favor of the listeners.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore competitors were Nathan B. Whitfield, James J. Perkins,
		  John Anthony, Nathan P. Ward, Henry C. Thompson, John E. Wharton, Daniel M.
		  Graham, Charles A. Mitchell, Junius B. Deberry. Mitchell, Graham, and Anthony
		  were considered the best. All graduated except Whitfield, who became a Colonel
		  C. S. A., and a Judge, and Perkins a planter.</p>
          <p>During the speaking opportunity was given for the presentation of a
		  prize offered by Professor Wheat, to Alphonzo C. Avery, for the best English
		  Composition. Professor Wheat's speech of presentation and President Swain's
		  reply were considered models of their kind.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday there were three extraordinary addresses. The first was
		  by Hon. George Davis, of the Class of 1838, afterwards Confederate States
		  Senator and Attorney-General. His subject was Sketches of the History and Men
		  of the Lower Cape Fear. The interest was enhanced by his excellent delivery. It
		  was printed in pamphlet, and is now much sought for.</p>
          <p>After him came Bishop Thomas Atkinson, of the Protestant Episcopal
		  Church, on the True Character of Cromwell. The Bishop's clear, incisive and
		  convincing address removed much of the odium heaped upon the great Oliver by
		  royalist pens. The press reporter, however, thought he was “too
		  apologetic for the artful tyrant and cunning statesman,” and complained
		  that he read his address, but his reading was so clear and forcible as to
		  command the attention of all.</p>
          <p>The third address was by Mr. Wm. J. Bingham, of the
		  <pb xml:id="p649" n="649"/>Class of 1825, one of the ablest teachers the State has
		  produced. The Alumni met at 4 P. M. to <choice><sic>escart</sic><corr>escort</corr></choice>him to
		  Gerrard Hall. Rev. Dr. Samuel I. Johnston, of the Class of 1826, and Lewis
		  Thompson of that of 1827, marched with him. Ex-Governors Graham, Manly, and
		  Morehead, John D. Hawkins, Robert B. Gilliam, Samuel J. Person, Bishop
		  Atkinson, Rev. Dr. Alexander Wilson, Rev. Drs. Simeon Colton and Richard H.
		  Mason, Congressman L. O'B. Branch, Treasurer Courts and other noted men were in
		  the procession of about 200 Alumni. The subject of the address was “The
		  Relative Wisdom of the Ancients and Moderns.” It was a satire on modern
		  progress. “Young America suffered from the multitude and sharpness of the
		  satiric arrows, and pseudo-progress, bleeding from innumerable wounds, fell an
		  easy victim to successful lampooning,” said the reporter.</p>
          <p>A pleasing incident was the dinner given by Richard H. Battle, of the
		  Class of 1854, to all his classmates who had come together on this occasion; if
		  not the pioneer of class dinners, the first recorded in public prints.</p>
          <p>The Chief Marshal was James Bruce of the Junior Class. His assistants,
		  or “Subs,” were Henry R. Bryan, Wm. H. Burwell, Samuel P. Caldwell,
		  and Wm. G. Drake. There was much commendation of them for their activity and
		  courtesy. The Ball Managers, Wm. Johnston Saunders being Chief, met with
		  similar praise.</p>
          <p>It should be noted that ex-Chief Justice Thomas Ruffin attended all
		  the examinations except those of Commencement week, the Bible and Chemistry. He
		  had just voluntarily resigned the high position as head of our Supreme Court,
		  which he had so ably filled, and accepted the more humble but important
		  position of Chairman of the Court of Pleas and Quarter Session of Alamance
		  County.</p>
          <p>Four members of the Class, Hall, Puttick, Slade, and Whitfield were
		  not absent from one of the 4,700 services required in their four years'
		  course.</p>
          <p>The graduating speeches were:</p>
          <p>The Latin Salutatory, James H. Colton.</p>
          <p>“Influence Inevitable in Extent and Duration,” Peter E.
		  Spruill.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p650" n="650"/>
          <p>“College Education and Its Defects,” Duncan E. McNair.</p>
          <p>“The American Explorer,” Wm. Gaston Lewis.</p>
          <p>“Commemorative Monuments,” James N. Turner.</p>
          <p>“Fate of the Gifted,” Jesse R. Wharton.</p>
          <p>“Geology and Anti-Christian,” James Campbell.</p>
          <p>“Science, Nature's Complement,” Charlton W. Yellowley.</p>
          <p>“Scottish Chivalry,” Evander J. McIver.</p>
          <p>“Which Way?” Edmund J. Gaines.</p>
          <p>“Love of Fame the Scholar's Fire,” John M. Puttick.</p>

		  Daniel McDougald.</p>
          <p>“Wellbeing of Man,” Robert E. James.</p>
          <p>“The Self-Made Man,” James R. Gatling.</p>
          <p>“Sailor's Destiny,” William H. Hull.</p>
          <p>Valedictory, Edward W. Gilliam.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Campbell, James and Spruill were especially praised, and next
		  to them McIver, Hall and Gaines.</p>
          <p>The first honor in this Class of '55 was awarded to James H. Colton,
		  Edward W. Gilliam, John M. Puttick.</p>
          <p>The second to Matthew S. Davis, Edmund J. Caines, Wm. H. Hall, Alfred
		  B. Irion, Daniel McDougald, Duncan E. McNair, Jesse R. Wharton.</p>
          <p>The third honor to Alexander D. Betts, James Campbell, James R.
		  Gatling, William W. Glover, Thomas B. Graham, Joseph H. Hyman, Wm. Gaston
		  Lewis, Evander J. McIver, Edward H. Plummer, James M. Smith, James N. Turner,
		  Charles Whitaker, James H. Whitfield.</p>
          <p>Of the first honor men Colton became a Presbyterian preacher and
		  teacher, President of Alexander College in Kentucky; Gilliam an Episcopal
		  minister, but resigned, and is now a physician in Baltimore; Puttick taught
		  school and then enlisted in the Confederate Navy, and died early.</p>
          <p>Of the others Davis was President of an important Female Seminary at
		  Louisburg; Irion was a lawyer, planter and Congressman from Louisiana, as well
		  as Judge of the Court of Appeals; Betts a much respected Methodist minister, a
		  Doctor of Divinity, Chaplain in the Army, and is generally designated as
		  “Father Betts,” is a Trustee of the University; Graham was a
		  Chancellor in Mississippi; Lewis a Civil Engineer, a Brigadier-General,
		  <pb xml:id="p651" n="651"/>one of the best in Lee's Army; McIver a Confederate
		  Colonel and State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Alabama; Montgomery a
		  Major, State Solicitor and Judge; Nicholson likewise a Major, a journalist and
		  Professor of Agriculture and Natural History in the University of
		  Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Of those matriculating, but not graduating, was Zebulon Baird Vance,
		  LL.D., Representative in the State Legislature and Congress, twice Governor and
		  United States Senator.</p>
          <p>John Alexander Smith, of Cumberland County, who was matriculated the
		  preceding year, a member of the Freshman Class, died on May 30th, near the
		  opening of Commencement.</p>
          <p>The matriculates of 1855 who were victims of the war were: Solomon W.
		  Alston, Assistant Surgeon; Robert W. Anderson, Lieutenant; Benjamin I. Blount,
		  Lieutenant; James G. Bustin, Sergeant; Thomas D. Claiborne,
		  Lieutenant;-Colonel; John T. Cook, Sergeant; Henry R. Daniel, Lieutenant; John

		  Lieutenant-Colonel; Daniel Stewart, Lieutenant; Augustine Burkette Washington,
		  ——; Joseph A. Williams, Captain; David C. Whitaker, Lieutenant.</p>
          <p>The Executive Committee of the Alumni Association reported the deaths
		  of Rev. Dr. John Witherspoon, James H. Norwood, Rev. L. A. Watts, L. G.
		  Slaughter, Joseph W. Evans, W. R. Walker, Alpheus Jones, John A. Lillington,
		  Philo Henderson, John B. Borden, Dr. John Hill, N. Y. Kelly, and B. M.
		  Thompson.</p>
          <p>John D. Hawkins was elected President and Richard H. Battle Treasurer
		  in place of Samuel F. Phillips, resigned.</p>
          <p>President Swain perseveringly carried out his policy of making
		  Commencement attractive. An ordinance was procured from the Trustees that no
		  member of the Faculty should leave Chapel Hill before Monday after
		  Commencement. This <pb xml:id="p652" n="652"/>not only secured their attendance,
		  but enabled the professors to make out reports more intelligently. They
		  seconded the policy of making the best possible impression on visitors by most
		  bounteous hospitality, far in advance of our day, when cooks and house maids
		  are free, not always obtainable and often lacking in efficiency.</p>
          <p>At the request of President Swain the <choice><sic>Evecutive</sic><corr>Executive</corr></choice>Committee met the Faculty at Chapel Hill for
		  the consideration of three questions: 1, The enlargement of Gerrard Hall; 2,
		  the building of new dormitories, and 3, the readjustment of salaries. The
		  Committee appear to have performed their mission with fidelity, attended a
		  meeting of the Faculty and praised the systematic reports of the professors,
		  visited the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies, and listened to the
		  exercises in their respective halls, and were impressed with the interest shown
		  by the junior members. They found a need most urgent of new dormitories, and
		  requested Mr. A. J. Davis to visit Chapel Hill and make plans for the
		  consideration of the Trustees. They likewise adopted in substance the following
		  ordinance, conditioned on the tuition and room rent being at least
		  $12,500.</p>

          <head>BURNING OF THE BELFRY.</head>
          <p>It was in 1856 during a sport of throwing fireballs, that is balls of
		  strips of cloth, tightly wrapped and saturated with alcohol or kerosene, that
		  the old belfry was burnt and the sonorous bell destroyed. Some thought that the
		  destruction was intentional, others that a fire-ball recklessly thrown lodged
		  in the lattice work opposite the bell and caused the mischief. Certainly no
		  proper effort was made to extinguish the flames, whether for want of ladder or
		  for want of inclination, it is possible to say. The Executive Committee
		  appointed a sub-committee to collect the facts and ordered them to be reported
		  to the Solicitor for the Orange Circuit, to the end that a criminal prosecution
		  might be instituted. As no bill was sent to the Grand Jury, it is presumable
		  that there was no probable evidence of guilt. There was some criticism of the
		  failure of a Tutor, who saw the fire, not rushing to the rescue, but there was
		  no official censure. Fortunately the new bell is so like the old that former
		  students cannot discern the change.</p>
          <p>The action taken by the two Literary Societies implies at least doubt
		  in the minds of a large majority of the members as to whether guilt did not
		  lodge somewhere. They declared that “manly virtue and sound sense were
		  inconsistent with the late disorders.” By joint agreement a fine of
		  $25 was to be imposed on any member guilty of the wanton destruction of
		  University property. The vote was over two one. The Phis who formed a committee
		  of their Society were Mills L. Eure, George L. Wilson, Thomas W. Cooper,
		  Richard C. Badger, and the Dis were James L. Gaines, James L. Robbins, Richard
		  F. Hamlin, Robert B. Houston, and William Bingham Lynch. It is worthy of note
		  that President Swain requested the Societies to take this action. It was his
		  policy to invoke the aid of the students wherever practicable. The punishment
		  was not made retroactive, as they understood well the constitutional inhibition
		  against <hi rend="italics">ex post facto</hi> laws. Nearly all the committeemen
		  won distinction in after life.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p654" n="654"/>
          <p>Three years afterwards the salaries were increased, that of the
		  President to $2,500, and residence, and that of Professor of Mathematics
		  to $1,800, out of which was to come $150 for house rent; that of
		  the Professor of Greek $1,650; of Latin $1,650; of History
		  $1,600, less $200 for house rent; of Rhetoric $1,600, less
		  $200 for house rent; of Civil Engineering $1,600; of Chemistry,
		  etc., $1,600, and of Modern Languages $1,400. The first Tutor
		  $800, and the others $700 each. The Bursar was allowed
		  $500, making Prof. Fetter's compensation $2,150.</p>
          <p>In 1859 $100 was added to the salaries of each of the eight
		  professors. The Senior Tutor, Solomon Pool, was promoted to be Adjunct
		  Professor of Pure Mathematics at a salary of $1,200, and also
		  $100 per annum for his services as Clerk.</p>

          <head>CASE OF PROFESSOR HEDRICK.</head>
          <p>In the fall of 1856, in the heated contest between Buchanan and
		  Fremont, Professor Benjamin Sherwood Hedrick startled the public by declaring
		  himself a Free-soiler and supporter of Fremont. He was attacked in the
		  <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Standard</hi>in a letter written by a law student,
		  an honor graduate of 1854, Joseph A. Engelhard. Being a man of pluck he replied
		  defending his position with ability, but taking the peculiar ground that the
		  prevention of carrying slaves to the territories would increase the wealth of
		  North Carolina by keeping her slaves and their incomes at home. The indignation
		  of the public and of the students was furious, and the public press generally
		  demanded his dismissal. The burning him in effigy in the campus, while the bell
		  was funereally tolled, was but the beginning of the warfare against him.</p>
          <p>President Swain stated to the Faculty and Trustees in substance that
		  in an institution like this, patronized by all denominations and parties,
		  nothing should be done calculated to disturb the harmonious intercourse of
		  those who support, and those who direct and govern it. Professor Hedrick
		  himself said, that he “knew of no institution North or South from which
		  partisan politics and sectarian religion are so carefully excluded.”
		  Cautious forbearance has been practiced by the <pb xml:id="p655" n="655"/>Faculty
		  and enjoined upon the students. Sermons in the chapel have been on the leading
		  doctrines of Christianity about which no difference of opinion exists. And
		  students for twenty years have not been allowed to discuss on the public stage
		  questions of party politics. The Faculty resolved, on motion of Rev. Dr.
		  Mitchell: 1st, that Professor Hedrick's course is not warranted by our usage,
		  and his political opinions are not entertained by any other member of the
		  Faculty; 2nd, that the Faculty have none other than feelings of personal
		  respect and kindness and sincerely regret his indiscretion.</p>
          <p>The vote was unanimous, except that the Instructor in French, Mr.
		  Henri Herrissee, dissented on the ground that the Faculty is not charged with
		  Black Republicanism, nor likely to be suspected of it.</p>
          <p>The Executive Committee acted promptly. On the 11th of October,
		  present Governor Bragg and Messrs. John H. Bryan, Daniel W. Courts, Charles L.
		  Hinton, Bartholomew F. Moore, and Romulus M. Saunders, the Committee expressed
		  great regret at the publication of Professor Hedrick in the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Standard</hi>on the 4th inst., because it violated the
		  established usage of the University which forbids any Professor to become an
		  agitator in the exciting politics of the day, and was well calculated to injure
		  the prosperity and usefulness of the institution.”</p>
          <p>It was further resolved that in the opinion of the Committee Mr.
		  Hedrick had greatly, if not entirely, destroyed his power to be of further
		  benefit to the University.</p>
          <p>It was hoped that the Professor would have resigned after this action,
		  but he was a man of singular persistency and pluck. In the meantime there were
		  signs of a coming storm. Politicians were getting ready to attack the
		  University on the stump, editors were meditating editorials denunciatory of an
		  institution which would keep in its Faculty an avowed enemy of Southern
		  institutions, parents were threatening to withdraw their sons from the
		  University, and students were devising further schemes of insult and annoyance
		  to make the Professor's position unendurable. The Committee prevented such evil
		  consequences by declaring his chair vacant. In the preamble
		  <pb xml:id="p656" n="656"/>to the resolution it was recited that he seemed disposed
		  to respect neither the opinions of the Faculty nor the Trustees, but persisted
		  in retaining his situation to the manifest injury of the University. His salary
		  was paid to the end of the term. Prof. Hedrick made no further opposition, and
		  behaved with dignity. He was born in Davidson County February 13th, 1827, was
		  of German descent. He was prepared for the University by Rev. Jesse Rankin. He
		  entered the Sophomore Class of 1848, and graduated in 1851, among the first
		  honor men. He was considered the ablest mathematician in the class, and was in
		  consequence recommended and appointed to a clerkship in the Nautical Almanac
		  office. He entered Harvard University in order to take advanced studies in
		  Mathematics. After being elected to the Chair of Chemistry applied to
		  Agriculture and the Arts, in 1854 he administered the department with ability.
		  When his office came to an untimely end, it was supposed that the anti-slavery
		  men of the North, where he sought employment, would take care of him, but they
		  gave only words. After some delay he obtained a clerkship in the office of the
		  Mayor of New York City, teaching and lecturing during his leisure. In 1861 he
		  became principal Chemical Examiner in the United States Patent Office, residing
		  in Georgetown, D. C. In 1865 he visited his native State and endeavored
		  unsuccessfully to induce all parties to acquiesce in negro suffrage, which he
		  foresaw would certainly be demanded by Congress, and then to place the
		  government of the State in the hands of the best and ablest men. He died
		  September 2nd, 1886, leaving his wife, Mary Ellen, daughter of William
		  Thompson, of Orange County, N. C., four sons and four daughters. His failure to
		  realize the success to which his uncommon talents, his thorough integrity, his
		  energy and industry seemed to entitle him, shows the importance of tactful
		  manners, and not hastily arousing the prejudices of communities on subjects
		  about which there is feverish excitement. Many professors at the North have
		  lost their places from inculcating doctrines odious to the governing bodies.
		  Dr. Charles Phillips, a friend of Hedrick, and a man of broad views, in a
		  letter written to Professor Kerr, then at Harvard, <pb xml:id="p657" n="657"/>tells
		  him that practically all the people think the Trustees did right and adds,
		  “I take it as an axiom that when we wish to work for the people for the
		  peoples' good, we are bound to consider their characteristics and not arouse
		  their prejudices unnecessarily, else they won't let us work for
		  them.”</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>THE HERRISSE CONTROVERSY.</head>
          <p>As showing the intensity of the feeling in the South on the subject of
		  slavery, such feeling as usually precedes resorts to war, I record the fact
		  that when about this time Professor Hedrick visited Salisbury, as a delegate to
		  an Educational Association, he was notified by the satellites of Judge Lynch
		  that he must immediately leave the town or be subject to gross personal
		  indignities. Brave as he was, he reluctantly made an abrupt departure for
		  home.</p>
          <p>Besides this Hedrick incident the Faculty were much stirred up near
		  the same time by what I will call the Herrisse controversy. M. Henri Herrisse,
		  who has distinguished himself in the field of letters in more recent years, was
		  in 1856, as has been said, Instructor in French at this University, a very
		  bright young man and a hard student. As is usually the case with foreigners, he
		  had difficulty in managing his classes. One student in particular (W. W.), was
		  not only impertinent, but outrageously insulting. After bearing with this youth
		  for awhile, he brought him before the Faculty. On the motion to dismiss him
		  there was a tie, and the President voted in the negative, giving as his reason
		  that the Faculty meeting, not being a regular one, had not been called
		  according to the by-laws.</p>
          <p>Mr. Herrisse was much offended at the decision and determined to
		  appeal to the Executive Committee of the Trustees. The Committee called for a
		  copy of the proceedings of the Faculty. With it was submitted a second memorial
		  by Herrisse, “setting forth a want of discipline and maladministration of
		  the affairs and government of the college by the Faculty.” This was
		  referred to the Faculty.</p>
          <p>The consideration of the subject was resumed on October 18th, the
		  several memorials of Mr. Herrissee, copies from the <pb xml:id="p658" n="658"/>
		  <hi rend="italics">University Journal,</hi>together with answers and
		  statements of the President and several of the Professors, being read, Governor
		  Bragg presented other papers from Mr. Herrisse, called by him “a
		  <choice><sic>Poscript</sic><corr>Postscript</corr></choice>to Memorial No. 1, and a key and appendix
		  to Memorial No. 2, and a Postscript to the Key and Memorial.”</p>
          <p>The whole subject was referred to Messrs. B. F. Moore, J. H. Bryan and
		  C. Manly. The Committee submitted sundry resolutions, which were amended and
		  adopted. They were substantially as follows: “The case of W. W. presents
		  repeated acts of disorder and irregularity in the recitation room of the French
		  Instructor, and the Faculty appear to have treated him with extraordinary
		  leniency.” The Committee however believe that the Faculty have superior
		  means of judging of the expediency of the discipline and have confidence in
		  their judgment. Mr. Herrissee has justly subjected himself to the complaints of
		  the Faculty, the Committee hope from want of knowledge of the institution and
		  the necessity of harmony. This last statement has reference to the charges
		  against the President and his colleagues.</p>
          <p>It could not be denied that the behavior of W. W. and others in the
		  class of Mr. Herrisse was intolerable. The President and Faculty in declining
		  to punish the offenders evidently acted from the belief that his want of tact
		  and his foreign manners to some extent mitigated the offences. A judicious
		  member of the Faculty stated that either the offenders should have been
		  dismissed from the institution or the Instructor asked to resign his post, that
		  the allowing such behavior to go on unpunished led to disorder in other
		  classes, and injured the good name of the University.</p>
          <p>During this year the Associate Professor of Greek, Mr. A. G. Brown,
		  resigned, and it was resolved to employ two Tutors in his place. Mr. Herrisse,
		  stating to his friends that President Swain would endeavor to select men who
		  would vote at his dictation, of his own motion wrote to two graduates
		  acceptable to himself. They were worthy of the place, but the President was
		  unwilling to submit to such violations of propriety. He caused to be spread on
		  the minutes of the <pb xml:id="p659" n="659"/>Faculty a long statement, showing
		  that he consulted the Professors of Greek and Latin, and acted under their
		  advice; that during the twenty years of his connection with the University he
		  had never adopted any important measure without notice to, and generally not
		  without the unanimous concurrence of, the Faculty. He further stated that in
		  relation to the delicate and difficult subject of appointments he had proceeded
		  with caution and deliberation, and always when in his power had conferred
		  freely with the Faculty before submitting a recommendation to the Board. No
		  Tutor had been nominated without unanimous concurrence of the Faculty. He
		  submitted resolutions, the substance of which I give: 1st, that the Instructor
		  in French was ill-advised in opening correspondence with parties on the subject
		  of Tutorships, without consultation with the President or any members of the
		  Faculty; 2nd, his statement that he would prevent the election of Mr. Killebrew
		  because he would, if chosen, sustain the views of the President, does not meet
		  with the concurrence of the Faculty. There were three votes against the first
		  resolution, those of Hedrick, Brown and Lucas, and on the second only Mr.
		  Brown.</p>
          <p>Mr. Herrisse did not remain in the service of the University longer
		  than the end of the term in December. In January the Board of Trustees created
		  the Professorship of Modern Languages, and elected Hosea H. Smith to fill it.
		  Mr. Herrisse was not a candidate. A resolution was passed prohibiting
		  communications by members of the Faculty to the Board except through the
		  President.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>NEW BUILDINGS, PROFESSORS AND DEPARTMENTS.</head>
          <p>The Trustees took up the question of new buildings. On motion of
		  ex-Governor Graham on June 3, 1856, a committee of three were appointed to
		  consider the question with power to employ an architect and report plans to the
		  Board. The President of the Board appointed Messrs. Graham, Swain and
		  Battle.</p>
          <p>On June 3rd, 1857, the Committee were authorized to expend
		  $30,000, but in June of the next year the plans of Mr. Percival, an
		  architect, who had been an officer of the English <pb xml:id="p660" n="660"/>army,
		  were adopted, and the New East and New West Buildings were begun. The builder
		  was Thomas H. Coates, the sum appropriated being $40,000. For the first
		  time in the University history heating with other than fireplaces was adopted
		  on the recommendation of Percival. Furnaces were placed in the basement of each
		  building and the hot water system adopted. The plan proved a failure, the rooms
		  near the furnaces being too warm and those at a distance being too cold. After
		  much expense the system was disused, not because the principle was faulty, but
		  because there was a defect in the work.</p>
          <p>Hildreth Hosea Smith, elected Professor of Modern Languages, was born
		  in Deerfield, New Hampshire, February 17th, 1820, was prepared for college at
		  Foxcroft Academy in Maine, and graduated in 1842, one of the best two in his
		  class. He became Professor in Catawba College at Newton, North Carolina, in
		  1850, and the next year was made President, and continued as such until his
		  election to the Chair of Modern Languages in the University. He continued in
		  this position until the institution was closed in 1868.</p>
          <p>After leaving the University at the request of Rev. Dr. Sears, the
		  Superintendent of the Peabody Fund, he organized the public schools of
		  Shelbyville, Tennessee. Four years later he performed the same service for
		  Houston, Texas. He was then called to the Presidency of the Sam Houston State
		  Normal College. He was afterwards for twelve years Literary Editor of the
		  <hi rend="italics">Atlanta Journal.</hi>His wife, Mary B., is a daughter of
		  Michael Hoke, the candidate of the Democratic party for the Governorship in
		  1844, and sister of the Confederate General, Robert F. Hoke. Among their
		  children is Hon. Hoke Smith, the next Governor of Georgia, Secretary of the
		  Interior under Cleveland.</p>
          <p>Professor Smith was a good teacher, has fine talents, and was
		  accomplished in his department. He was possessed of such physical strength as
		  to gain the nickname of “Old Tige.” Once in fighting a fire in the
		  village the bystanders were amazed at his extraordinary skill and prowess.</p>
          <p>Mr. John Kimberly was elected in place of Professor Hedrick. He was a
		  man of superior talent, a native of New Jersey, <pb xml:id="p661" n="661"/>and
		  graduated at the Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University. He had high
		  testimonials from Agassiz, Wyman and Horsford. Agassiz stated that the notes of
		  his lectures written by him were the best ever submitted by any student since
		  his connection with the school. He had been teaching for several years in
		  Eastern North Carolina, married into the Capehart family and was a widower
		  without children. Feeling the need of latest discoveries in his department, he
		  asked and obtained leave to spend a year in a laboratory of the University of
		  Berlin. He, too, occupied his chair until 1868, and was Professor for a year
		  after the reopening.</p>
          <p>I give briefly the studies of each department after the introduction
		  of Civil Engineering and of Industrial Chemistry.</p>
          <p>The Department of Moral Philosophy, Metaphysics, Political Economy,
		  Constitutional Law, International Law, was administered by the President.
		  Instruction was given the Seniors five hours per week for the academic year,
		  less the Senior vacation of one month prior to Commencement. Metaphysics and
		  Political Economy occupied the first term. The Sunday recitations throughout
		  the year were given on the Pentateuch and Moral Science. The text-books were
		  Wayland's Moral Science, Abercrombie's Intellectual Powers, Wayland's Political
		  Economy, Sheppard's Constitutional Law and the first volume of Kent's
		  Commentaries.</p>
          <p>Oral lectures were given from time to time, and towards the close of
		  the year a regular course on the History of Constitutional Law, beginning with
		  Magna Charta and ending with the Constitution of the United States.</p>
          <p>The Greek Language and Literature occupied four hours a week for the
		  Freshman year. The books studied were the Anabasis of Xenophon and Herodotus.
		  The Sophomore Class had four recitations a week during the first, and three
		  during the second term. They read part of the Iliad, selected Orations of
		  Demosthenes and Thucydides. The Junior Class, having two recitations a week,
		  studied such Tragedies of Sophocles as the Professor designated and the Senior,
		  with one recitation a week, read the Gorgias of Plato. The teachers were Manuel
		  Fetter, Professor, and Tutors Richard H. Battle and Samuel S. Jackson.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p662" n="662"/>
          <p>The Latin Department, presided over by one professor, Rev. Dr. F. M.
		  Hubbard, and Tutors Joseph B. Lucas and Peter E. Spruill, had for the Freshmen
		  four recitations a week. They read Virgil's Georgics, some of Cicero's Orations
		  and Livy. The Sophomores with three recitations the first term and four during
		  the second, were occupied with the Odes and Satires of Horace, then the
		  Epistles of Horace, and Cicero on the Immortality of the Soul. The Juniors with
		  two hours a week for the year, had the Satires of Juvenal and then Cicero's
		  Brutus; the Seniors with one week being satisfied with Cicero de Officiis.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Brown and Lucas taught also in the Greek Department.</p>
          <p>The Department of Mathematics was conducted by the Senior Professor,
		  Dr. James Phillips, aided by Tutors Solomon Pool and Thaddeus C. Coleman. The
		  three lower classes had four recitations a week. The Freshmen studied Peirce's
		  Algebra, and Munroe's and Peirce's Geometry. The Sophomores took up Phillips'
		  Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with its application to Navigation,
		  Surveying, etc., then Loomis' Differential and Integral Calculus. The Seniors
		  studied Olmsted's Natural Philosophy and Norton's Astronomy.</p>
          <p>One of the four recitations of the Junior year was given up to
		  lectures on Natural Philosophy (Physics) and Astronomy. They were illustrated
		  by experiments, performed with skill, and were extremely interesting and
		  instructing.</p>
          <p>In 1855 an Analytical, as distinct from a Geometrical course of
		  Mathematics during the Sophomore and Junior years, was organized. It proved
		  unsatisfactory and had been abandoned. It was found best to give the same
		  studies to the less gifted, as well as the more gifted, thus stimulating the
		  former, while the latter were constantly urged to higher work than was afforded
		  by the curriculum.</p>
          <p>In Modern Languages the Sophomores and Junior Classes had two
		  recitations a week throughout the year. The Sophomores studied Levizac's
		  Grammar, with exercises in writing French, and also De Fivas' Classic French
		  Reader. The <pb xml:id="p663" n="663"/>Junior year was devoted to Moliere's
		  Comedies, Rowan's Modern French Reader, and a review of the studies of the
		  course. There was a class in German two hours a week for a year and optional
		  courses were offered in German, Spanish and Italian.</p>
          <p>The modern languages except German, were regarded and taught as
		  dialects of the Ancient.</p>
          <p>The text-books were Ollendorf's German and Spanish Grammars, Adler's
		  German Reader, Don Quixote, Schiller's Maid of Orleans, Goethe's Iphigenia in
		  Tauris; Monti's Italian Grammar, Tasso's Jerusalem Delivered. There was only
		  one teacher, Professor Smith.</p>
          <p>The Department of History had two recitations for the year, for the
		  Freshman Class, and two for the Junior. Freshmen studied History of Greece and
		  then of Rome. Juniors gave their time to Modern History, especially England and
		  the United States. The classes were stimulated to investigations of historical
		  subjects outside the text-books. Rev. Albert M. Shipp was the Professor in
		  charge.</p>
          <p>In Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology I give the last work of the
		  Department under Dr. Mitchell.</p>
          <p>Two lectures to the Junior and two to the Senior Class were delivered
		  each week. They were illustrated by experiments and exhibition of specimens.
		  After an interval of an hour after each lecture an examination was had on its
		  facts and doctrines. Chemistry, its Nomenclature and General Doctrines, the
		  Imponderables, including Light, Heat, Electricity and Galvanism, as related to
		  Chemistry, and the non-metallic elements, occupied the Junior year. In the
		  Senior year the non-metallic elements, if any remained unfinished, were
		  completed, with the Metals and Organized bodies.</p>
          <p>In natural History, the sciences of Botany and Zoology were taught
		  only as to their methods, classifications and modes of distinguishing plants
		  and animals from one another. More time was given to Mineralogy and pains was
		  taken to acquaint the student with the more common and useful minerals. A very
		  sufficient collection had been made, and was increasing from year to year. The
		  cabinet purchased in Viena afforded additional facilities to those desiring
		  more accurate knowledge.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p664" n="664"/>
          <p>In the Department of Logic and Rhetoric the Sophomores were required
		  to write compositions every third week during the first term. These were
		  carefully criticised. In the second term lectures were given on the origin and
		  growth of the English language. In the Junior year the lectures were on habits
		  of reading and writing for the proper conduct of the Understanding, Forms and
		  Tribunals of Taste and Criticism, Elocution and the different kinds of Oratory.
		  The class had occasional exercises in extemporaneous speaking and debate.</p>
          <p>The Senior Class had two recitations a week in Whately's Logic and
		  Rhetoric. At the close of the second term each Senior was required to deliver
		  in public an original oration, the correction and supervision of which devolved
		  on the Professor of Rhetoric and Logic, Rev. John Thomas Wheat, D.D.</p>
          <p>The Law School continued to be only nominally a department of the
		  University. The Professor, Judge Battle, received no salary from the
		  institution, and his students paid nothing to it, nor were they amenable to its
		  discipline. Judge Battle was absent nearly half his time at the Supreme Court.
		  During this absence Samuel F. Phillips, then a practicing lawyer, when not at
		  his courts, took charge of the classes.</p>
          <p>There were two classes, the Independent, which had no connection with
		  the University, reciting three times each week, and the College Class,
		  consisting of undergraduates, allowed by the Faculty to study law, reciting
		  twice only.</p>
          <p>The books studied were those prescribed by the Supreme
		  Court—Blackstone's Commentaries, Cruise's Digest, Fearne on Remainders,
		  Iredell on Executors, Stephen on Pleading, Smith on Contracts, Greenleaf on
		  Evidence, and Adam's Equity. Lectures on the Common Law, with special reference
		  to the Legislation and Judicial decisions of North Carolina, were written out
		  by the Judge, but students were so urgent to obtain their licenses to practice
		  that they were often omitted. The instruction was almost altogether
		  catechetical, that is, questions on prescribed lessons in the text-books. Moot
		  Courts were offered to the students, but not often used.</p>
          <p>The degree of B.L. was given to members of the Independent Class
		  satisfactorily completing the two years' course.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p665" n="665"/>
          <p>The fee of the Independent was $50 per term, of the college
		  students $40.</p>
          <p>It was found in practice that those students who had been vigorously
		  catechized, and had shown their proficiency by answering searching questions on
		  the statements of the text-books, made a far better showing before the Supreme
		  Court than those who had read the law under the general supervision of a lawyer
		  and thought they understood it, but had never been called on to tell what they
		  knew.</p>
          <p>The requisites for admission in the Freshman Class were the Grammars
		  of the English, Greek and Latin Languages, Latin Prosody, Andrew's or Arnold's
		  Exercises, Cæsar's Commentaries, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Virgil's Bucolics
		  and six Books of the æneid, Sallust.</p>
          <p>In Greek was required St. John's Gospel and the Acts, Gracca Minora or
		  Greek Reader.</p>
          <p>In Mathematics Arithmetic, Algebra through Equations of the first
		  degree.</p>
          <p>Ancient and Modern Geography were also in the list of requisites.</p>
          <p>There was much complaint of insufficient preparation. In the
		  mathematics more time and practice was recommended in problems wherein the
		  rules of Arithmetic were involved with more or less complexity, otherwise
		  instructors must do the drilling of the grammar school instead of maturing the
		  taste and scholarship of the pupils.</p>
          <p>Mr. A. G. Brown, who left the University in this year, taught in
		  various places: in this State, in Tennessee, in California, in Honolulu, and
		  again in North Carolina. In all he had similar experiences. Beginning with fair
		  prospects, highly respected for his talents, scholarship, skill and bearing of
		  a gentleman, his temper so soon embroiled him with the school authorities that
		  he thought proper to resign. In his old age, having no near kin to take care of
		  him, his old pupil, Colonel J. B. Killebrew, procured for him light work as an
		  assistant secretary, but he lost the place for the same reason. On account of
		  increasing infirmity, according to his own wishes, <pb xml:id="p666" n="666"/>he
		  was placed in the Home for the Aged in Nashville, Tennessee, and there died in
		  September, 1906.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>CENSURE OF THE FACULTY.</head>
          <p>It was during this year that the Executive Committee passed a
		  resolution that they had heard with deep regret of gross irregularities of
		  conduct by students on the railroad cars, at circuses and other places, and
		  they had reason to believe that these irregularities are daily increasing for
		  want of due execution of the Ordinances of the University. They then declare
		  that the usefulness of the institution depends not so much on numbers as on
		  exemplary conduct and that, not only in view of the approaching State Fair, but
		  on all occasions, the Faculty are expected to execute the ordinances so as
		  either to subdue all disobedient conduct or dismiss the refractory.</p>
          <p>The specification in regard to misconduct on the railroad cars was
		  that once when large numbers of students were traveling together in the rear
		  coach their conduct was so boisterous that the conductor switched it off on a
		  siding, uncoupled it and started off with the rest of the train with such
		  rapidity as to induce signals of distress and promise of reformation of
		  behavior. How much of this conduct was due to natural buoyancy of spirits at
		  release from duties, and how much to the artificial buoyancy of John
		  Barleycorn, is unknown, but the incident was widely spread, <hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">vires acquirit eundo</foreign>,</hi>and was
		  asserted to be the habitual method of traveling by the University boys. It
		  could not be denied however that there was occasional rowdyism and, more
		  rarely, excitement from spirituous liquors.</p>
          <p>The Faculty, and especially President Swain, were greatly moved by the
		  censure of the Committee. The President drew up a paper which was passed by the
		  Faculty, declaring that the stories were greatly exaggerated; that all
		  diligence was used in carrying out the laws of the University; that it was
		  absolutely impossible to prevent sporadic breaches of discipline, and all
		  detected infractions were duly punished.</p>
          <p>Nothing further was done in the matter.</p>

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1856.</head>
          <div3 type="section">
            <head>INVITATION TO ARCHBISHOP HUGHES.</head>
            <p>In the same year there was a notable stir in the University world
			 over a question which would not now attract notice. The Senior Class, in
			 pursuance of a privilege long enjoyed, met to elect a preacher of the
			 Baccalaureate sermon during the following Commencement. From various motives,
			 some from mere curiosity, some from disapprobation of the principles of the
			 American, or Know Nothing party, some probably from a desire to tease the
			 Faculty, a majority of the class voted to invite Archbishop Hughes, of the
			 Roman Catholic Church. The committee appointed wrote the invitation at
			 once.</p>
            <p>There was great consternation among the Faculty and other friends of
			 the University, who feared that the vengeance of orthodox Protestants would
			 destroy its patronage, and the American party become its enemy. President Swain
			 was so moved that he delivered to the class a carefully written address, which
			 he repeated to the Faculty.</p>
            <p>He stated that no one doubted the ability of the Archbishop, but he
			 felt bound to intimate to them that their course was indiscreet and
			 ill-advised; that he had always regarded religious tests wrong, and in the
			 Convention of 1835 voted to strike out of the Constitution the 32nd article.
			 His objection to this gentleman was not on account of a difference of creed,
			 but because his appearance as the representative of the University would be
			 distasteful to the great majority of those who attended the Commencement
			 exercises. It would be especially painful to about one-fourth of the class, who
			 were members of the leading denominations in the State.</p>
            <p>He called to mind the fact that to secure harmony at Commencement
			 the Senior speeches were revised by the Professor of Rhetoric, and allusions to
			 slavery, or party politics, were expunged, and loss of diploma was the penalty
			 for not heeding the correction. He advised that the Executive Committee should
			 be consulted before sending the invitation.</p>
            <p>The President asked the approval of his address by the
			 <pb xml:id="p668" n="668"/>Faculty, which was given with only two dissentients,
			 Rev. Dr. Hubbard, who was a “High Church” Episcopalian, and M.
			 Herrisse, who, while at the University, showed no predilection for any
			 religious denomination.</p>
            <p>The Executive Committee, present Governor Bragg and Messrs. John H.
			 Bryan, D. W. Courts (State Treasurer), Charles Manly and Romulus M. Saunders,
			 considered the action of the President and the Faculty on the subject. The
			 President took care to explain that the reason for throwing the responsibility
			 on them was that they, and not the Faculty, had conferred the election on the
			 Seniors. He deemed the matter of sufficient importance to report in detail the
			 religious proclivities of some members of the class. There were 44 in all. Only
			 26 were present at the election. There were eleven professing Christians, viz:
			 one Baptist, two Episcopalians, five <choice><sic>Presbterians</sic><corr>Presbyterians</corr></choice>and three Methodists, one of the latter
			 being a clergyman. Of these ten were among the minority. The President
			 reiterated the statement that in the Convention of 1835 he voted to strike out
			 the Constitutional prohibition against Roman Catholics holding office. The
			 Committee approved his action, and resolved that while they earnestly deprecate
			 anything like religious intolerance, as in conflict alike with the principles
			 of the Constitution, and their own views, there are other important
			 considerations, the force and bearing of which upon the question at this time,
			 the Executive Committee could better understand and more justly appreciate than
			 the Senior Class. The action of President Swain in advising the class to
			 consult the Committee was judicious. As the invitation to deliver the sermon
			 had already been transmitted, it was not deemed expedient to take further
			 action.</p>
            <p>The interest shown by the President in the matter will be better
			 understood when it is recalled that the “Know Nothing” National
			 Convention was about to meet in Philadelphia, and their orators generally
			 endeavored to arouse prejudice against Roman Catholics, as being under foreign
			 influence. It seemed to some that the Democrats of the Senior Class sought to
			 commit the University against this doctrine and so bring it into politics.</p>
            <pb xml:id="p669" n="669"/>
            <p>However this may be the Archbishop relieved all anxiety by declining
			 the invitation. Four years later the invitation was renewed and accepted, and
			 he preached on the Love of Christ, a sermon which pleased and instructed a
			 numerous audience, composed almost entirely of Protestants.</p>
            <p>The Catalogue of 1855-56 showed 366 students, every State in the
			 Union South of Mason and Dixon's line, except Maryland, being represented, as
			 were sixty counties in this State. There were forty-nine Seniors. Of the Board
			 of Examiners Colonel Walter L. Steele attended all examinations, Rev. Cushing
			 B. Hassell the greater part, while ex-Governors Morehead and Graham and Hon.
			 Giles Mebane were present as often as their engagements permitted.</p>
            <p>On Monday morning the classes were examined on the Holy Scriptures.
			 At night the Baccalaureate sermon was preached by Rev. Basil Manly, Jr., Pastor
			 of a Baptist Church in Richmond, Va. It was “solemn, earnest and
			 thoroughly evangelical,” on the text: “Wherewithal shall a young
			 man cleanse his way.”</p>
            <p>Tuesday morning the Senior Class were <choice><sic>examained</sic><corr>examined</corr></choice>on International and Constitutional Law,
			 Agricultural Chemistry and Engineering, and at night came on the Freshman
			 Declaimers: Nathan B. Small, C. Stephens Croom, Hugh L. Cole, John T. Cook,
			 Henry L. Rugeley, James P. Coffin, Charles W. McClammy, Algernon R. Morris,
			 Alexander Kirkland, James H. Swindell; Messrs. Cole, Cook and Morris were
			 especially commended.</p>
            <p>The Sophomore Declaimers spoke on Wednesday night: Winter H.
			 Goodloe, Reuell M. Stancill, William C. Dowd, Jesse S. Barnes, John A. Gilmer,
			 Julius W. Wright, Joseph M. White, Leroy M. McAfee, Wm. M. Coleman. The verdict
			 of the hearers was that “better speaking than that of Messrs. Stancill,
			 Gilmer and Wright is seldom heard, while that of Mr. Coleman was a perfect
			 gem.”</p>
            <p>The Judges for the prize for the best English Composition divided it
			 between Wm. M. Coleman and Thomas W. Mason. It was a set of Washington Irving's
			 Works.</p>
            <p>The Annual Address on Wednesday was by Hon. Matt W.
			 <pb xml:id="p670" n="670"/>Ransom, of the Philanthropic Society, a graduate of the
			 Class of 1847. His theme was “The Union—the Importance of Its
			 Preservation.” It was able and eloquent, worthy of the great subject. In
			 five years he was fighting for its destruction.</p>
            <p>Rev. Joseph M. Atkinson, of the Presbyterian Church at Raleigh, read
			 before the Historical Society a carefully prepared and most interesting paper
			 on the Life and Time of Sir William Berkeley, Royal Governor of the Colony of
			 Virginia. The correspondent bewailed the thinness of the attendance, but
			 philosophically consoled himself with the thought that “when lamb and
			 green peas, ice cream and fruits, are abundant within, and the thermometer is
			 at 90 without, the spirit may be very willing, but the flesh woefully
			 weak.”</p>
            <p>There was no Alumni Address. The oldest Alumnus present was James
			 Mebane, who matriculated in 1795, and left two years afterwards. The oldest
			 graduate was John Branch, of the Class of 1801. The Committee on the new
			 Caldwell Monument reported sufficient funds, $1,197.96, and they were
			 instructed to have it erected at once. James Mebane was elected President of
			 the Association.</p>
            <p>The assemblage in Gerrard Hall on Commencement Day was large and
			 brilliant. The speaking of the Seniors was as follows:</p>
            <p>Latin Salutatory, Henry R. Bryan.</p>
            <p>“The American Engineer,” Adolphus A. Lawrence.</p>
            <p>“The Claims of the Fine Arts,” Joseph W. Stephenson.</p>
            <p>“Necessity of a National University,” E. Graham
			 Morrow.</p>
            <p>“Perpetual Progress of the Human Mind,” Thomas Bogg
			 Slade.</p>
            <p>“Napoleon Bonaparte,” Thomas W. Jones.</p>
            <p>“The Empire of Mind,” Marmaduke S. Robins.</p>
            <p>“St. Paul,” A. Haywood Merritt.</p>
            <p>“The People and Their Common Schools,” William
			 Bingham.</p>
            <p>“Farming Becoming One of the Learned Professions,” Wm.
			 F. Alderman.</p>
            <p>“Sir Nigel Bruce,” John Cooper Waddill.</p>
            <p>“I Am an American,” Daniel W. Johnson.</p>
            <pb xml:id="p671" n="671"/>
            <p>“The American Politician,” Clement Dowd.</p>
            <p>“The People and Their University,” J. Buckner
			 Killebrew.</p>
            <p>The Valedictory, Coleman Sessions.</p>
            <p>It was the general opinion that seldom were so many good speeches
			 heard in one day. For manner and matter combined those of Lawrence, Merritt,
			 Bingham and Killebrew were especially praised, while the palm for fiery vigor
			 in declamation was conceded to Johnson.</p>
            <p>When the lots were cast for the Valedictory and Salutatory Sessions
			 obtained the former and Killebrew the latter, which was by consent transferred
			 to Bryan.</p>
            <p>The class numbered forty-seven, only eighteen of whom entered as
			 Freshmen. There were eighty-four connected with it from time to time.</p>
            <p>The first honor was assigned to William Bingham, J. Buckner
			 Killebrew, Adolphus A. Lawrence, Marmaduke S. Robins, and Coleman Sessions.</p>
            <p>The second to Wm. F. Alderman, Robert G. Barrett, Henry R. Bryan,
			 John B. Erwin, John T. Gilmore, Daniel W. Johnson, A. Haywood Merritt, E.
			 Graham Morrow, Thomas Bog Slade, and J. Cooper Waddill.</p>
            <p>The third honor went to James Bruce, John R. Burney, John S. Hines,
			 Joseph W. Stevenson, Stuart White, and Neill S. Yarborough.</p>
            <p>Killebrew's course should encourage men of pluck. He said to the
			 Faculty, “I know I am not prepared to enter the University, but I have
			 just money enough to enable me to graduate. I will not go in debt. Let me try,
			 or I must go elsewhere.” He was admitted and was always among the best in
			 his class.</p>
            <p>Wm. Ballard Bruce obtained the first honor in Mathematics and
			 French; Slade was the only perfectly punctual member for four years; Waddill
			 and McNair never missed a duty after entering—three years.</p>
            <p>Of the first honor men, Wm. Bingham became Principal of one of the
			 best male schools in the South, and author of very good Latin text-books. He
			 was also Confederate Colonel; Killebrew was State Superintendent of Public
			 Instruction and <pb xml:id="p672" n="672"/>Commissioner of Agriculture, a strong
			 writer for the press and author of an octavo volume showing the resources of
			 Tennessee; Lawrence was a Surgeon C. S. A., Superintendent of the Memphis City
			 Hospital and U. S. Marine Hospital; Robins was a strong lawyer, State Senator
			 and Speaker of the House of Representatives; Sessions died soon after
			 graduation.</p>
            <p>Of the others Barrett is a prominent Methodist minister; Bryan a
			 Judge of the Superior Court; Merritt a useful State Senator and Trustee of the
			 University.</p>
            <p>The honorary degree of Master of Arts was conferred on Samuel H.
			 Wiley, of North Carolina.</p>
            <p>The list of the Confederate dead of the matriculates is mournfully
			 large; Isaac T. Attmore, Private; Junius C. Battle, Corporal; George P. Bryan,
			 Captain; Charles Bruce, Jr., Captain; Thomas W. Cooper, Lieutenant; Addison

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1857.</head>
          <p>The Board of Examiners, members of the Board of Trustees, submitted
		  through their chairman, Col. Walter L. Steele, a report which for the first
		  time was publicly read. They expressed themselves as gratified on the whole,
		  but stated that they found many deficient in scholarship and some very much
		  deficient. The Trustees requested the Committee to make another report in
		  1858.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p673" n="673"/>
          <p>The Marshals, Robert J. L. Connor Chief, and John Anthony, Thomas H.
		  Christmas, Junius B. DeBerry and Cadwallader Polk, gave entire satisfaction.
		  The same can be said of the Ball Managers, John W. Graham, Chief, Gabriel J.
		  Davie, Jesse Hargrave, Norman A. Morrison, Junius M. Ramsey and Isaac N.
		  Tillett, Subs.</p>
          <p>The favorite landlady, Miss Nancy Hilliard, was not present to care
		  for the guests, having concluded to seek ease and quiet in her old age. Her
		  successor, Hugh B. Guthrie, well sustained the reputation of the old Eagle,
		  changing its name to Union Hotel. The price paid was $10,000.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1857 was ushered in by the Baccalaureate sermon
		  preached by the Right Reverend James Hervey Otey, Bishop of Tennessee, who
		  graduated in 1820, and was then tutor for a year. His subject was Life
		  Pilgrimage. He took occasion to pay a most feeling tribute to Dr. Mitchell,
		  attributing to him a direct and most beneficial influence on his own life. It
		  proved to be an elegy as the good Doctor, less than thirty days after lay cold
		  in death at the foot of a precipice on Mount Mitchell. A year afterwards the
		  Bishop preached his venerable preceptor's funeral sermon on its summit.</p>
          <p>The next oration was an elaborate and eloquent argument by Rev.
		  Francis L. Hawks, D.D., which has been published, in advocacy of the verity of
		  the Mecklenburg Declaration of May 20th, 1775. The distinguished divine and
		  author was fiercely in earnest. He did not spare Jefferson and other
		  disbelievers in the authenticity of the paper so dear to numerous patriotic
		  North Carolinians. In his audience, but bound to silence by the proprieties of
		  the occasion, was an equally ardent opponent of the disputed document,
		  Professor, afterwards Doctor, Charles Phillips.</p>
          <p>The Freshmen Declaimers on Tuesday night were William T. Nicholson,
		  Junius C. Battle, Benjamin W. Brown, Tobias Gibson, Wm. J. Headen, Daniel R.
		  Coleman, Alexander T. Cole, Iowa M. Royster, Wm. J. Hogan. The reporter gave
		  the palm to Nicholson and Coleman, and unfavorably criticised Gibson for
		  intentionally making a caricature of Robert <pb xml:id="p674" n="674"/>Emmett's
		  well known speech delivered in court after he was condemned to death.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday Henry Watkins Miller, a distinguished orator, and eminent
		  lawyer of Raleigh, a graduate of 1834, delivered the annual oration. The
		  address was an able laudation of the United States Constitution, but, being
		  read without raising eyes from manuscript, disappointed the audience. The
		  peroration however sustained his reputation. He left his written speech, and
		  with the flashing of his dark eyes and with sonorous voice, for which he was
		  conspicuous, he exclaimed, “We cannot—we DARE not surrender one jot
		  or title of our Federal Constitution to the demands of sectional ambition, or
		  the mad behests of fanaticism! It is that which has made us what we are—a
		  prosperous, happy, powerful people. Under and by that we are content to live.
		  It will guide us to a still higher degree of national prosperity and glory. It
		  will prove an impenetrable shield to our rights, our honor, our safety. But
		  if—which heaven forbid! the dread conflict with faction and fanaticism
		  <hi rend="italics">must</hi>come, let us appeal to the example of the immortal
		  Washington, to inspire our hearts with patriotism to meet the crisis, and to
		  the just God of our fathers, to lead us through that conflict and give us
		  courage to face and fortitude to bear the direful consequences which may
		  follow.”</p>
          <p>In four years Mr. Miller was a member of the General Assembly about to
		  meet in adjourned session for the purpose of calling the Secession Convention,
		  and voting money and troops to join the Confederate forces. Stumbling down his
		  staircase he fell on his head, received a mortal blow, and so never saw the
		  “direful consequences” which he predicted.</p>
          <p>At the close of the address the Alumni Association held their meeting.
		  The venerable James Mebane resigned by letter, Mr. Paul C. Cameron, an alumnus,
		  but not a graduate, was elected to the Presidency in his place.</p>
          <p>The Alumni who died during the year were reported as Archibald D.
		  Smith, Walker Anderson, Benjamin Y. Beene, Alexander M. Hogan, Burton Smith,
		  William A. McIntyre.</p>
          <p>The Committee on the Caldwell Monument reported that the very severe
		  winter had prevented its <choice><sic>completon</sic><corr>completion</corr></choice>as expected.
		  <pb xml:id="p675" n="675"/>On motion of Bishop Otey, seconded by Dr. Hawks, they
		  were instructed to make all proper arrangements for the dedication at the next
		  Commencement.</p>
          <p>Judge Battle, Professor Shipp and S. F. Phillips were chosen Executive
		  Committee and Tutor R. H. Battle, Jr., Treasurer. The Association accompanied
		  Orator Warren Winslow to Gerrard Hall, and at the conclusion of his address
		  thanks were tendered him for his “most agreeable performance,” and
		  a copy requested for publication. Mr. Winslow's career illustrates the value of
		  a trained mind. After leaving the University in 1827 he was a merchant until
		  ruined by the panic of 1837. Not disheartened, he became a lawyer and attained
		  high rank in his profession. He was honored by his county with a seat in the
		  Senate, was chosen President of that body, as such acted as Governor. He
		  likewise was a Representative in Congress, and Chairman of the Military Board
		  of this State.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore Declaimers of Wednesday night were James P. Coffin,
		  Thomas C. Evans, Joseph L. Granberry, Alexander Kirkland, Wells Thompson, Henry
		  L. Rugely, C. Stephen Croom, John T. Cook, Henry C. Lee and Charles W.
		  McClammy.</p>
          <p>Of the Freshmen all remained for graduation except Brown and Gibson;
		  of the Sophomores all except Evans and Lee.</p>
          <p>The reporter decided that Coffin and Kirkland were the best Sophomore
		  speakers. Governor Bragg delivered to Mr. McClammy an Encyclopedia of Biography
		  offered by Dr. Wheat for the best English essay.</p>
          <p>There were sixty-nine graduates. The first honor was assigned to
		  Alphonso C. Avery, Robert Bingham, Benjamin F. Grady, Joseph Venable, James L.
		  A. Webb and John E. Wharton. These drew lots for the honorary speeches, Webb
		  getting the Latin Salutatory and Wharton the Valedictory.</p>
          <p>Those obtaining second honor were John H. Coble, John E. Dugger,
		  Hubert Harvey, John C. McLauchlin, Julius A. Robbins, Felix G. Smith, Jonathan
		  F. L. Stewart, Henry C. Thompson, George L. Wimberly.</p>
          <p>Those obtaining third distinction were Thaddeus C. Belsher, Daniel
		  McL. Graham, John W. Graham, Leonidas N. B. Hayley, <pb xml:id="p676" n="676"/>
		  William H. Hayley, Charles A. Mitchell, Henry R. Thorp, Nathan P. Ward, and
		  Frank S. Wilkinson.</p>
          <p>It was stated that William H. Jordan would have obtained honor if he
		  had not left the University in order to be a Tutor at Wake Forest College.
		  Counting him there were twenty-five honor men or about thirty-six per cent. of
		  the class.</p>
          <p>Following the first honor men into after life we find Avery a Captain,
		  a Judge of the Superior and Supreme Courts of the State and a State Senator;
		  Bingham a Captain and the Principal of the Bingham School at Asheville, with
		  the rank of Colonel; Grady a Sergeant, Professor of Mathematics in Austin
		  College, Texas, a teacher of a classical school and a Representative in
		  Congress; Venable a teacher in Virginia; Webb a Confederate soldier and
		  merchant; Wharton a Captain.</p>
          <p>Of the others Belsher, after serving in the Confederate Army, became
		  founder of the University of Columbus and of Carrollton College in Mississippi;
		  John W. Graham Tutor of Mathematics, and for years a Trustee of our University,
		  Major, State Senator, Member of the Convention of 1868, a lawyer of
		  eminence.</p>
          <p>Of those not graduating with honors Thomas S. Kenan was a Colonel,
		  member of the Legislature, Attorney-General, Clerk of the Supreme Court,
		  President of the Alumni Association and Trustee of the University; McLean was a
		  Major, member of the Legislature of Texas, Representative in Congress, member
		  of the Convention of 1875, and a District Judge.</p>
          <p>The degree of Bachelor of Science, the first in the history of the
		  institution, was awarded to James E. Lindsay, subsequently a physician and a
		  Professor in the Baltimore Medical College.</p>
          <p>The following delivered orations on Commencement Day, it being the
		  rule that all honor men should speak unless excused: J. L. A. Webb, the Latin
		  Salutatory; J. E. Wharton, the Valedictory, as has been said; John E. Dugger,
		  the Greek, and Joseph Venable the French Oration. Messrs. J. L. Steward, R.
		  Bingham, A. C. Avery, J. C. McLauchlin, B. F. Grady, Jr., J. H. Coble, Charles
		  A. Mitchell, J. A. Robbins, John W. Graham, delivered English orations. Those
		  particularly <pb xml:id="p677" n="677"/>noticed by the reporter were Bingham, Grady
		  and Robbins, Dugger's Greek was pronounced correct, while Wharton's Valedictory
		  was peculiarly touching.</p>
          <p>The matriculates of this year were just of the age to rush into the
		  war as an holiday excursion. This melancholy list shows that thirty-three never
		  returned: Lawrence M. Anderson, Lieutenant; William H. Austin, Sergeant; Henry
		  K. Burgwyn, Jr., Colonel; Thomas Cowan, Private; John H. D. Fain, Captain;
		  James W. W. Ferebee, Captain; Benjamin L. Gill, Lieutenant; Thomas S. Hill,
		  Ord. Sergt.; Joseph V. Jenkins, Private; H. Francis Jones, Lieutenant; John
		  McDonald Land, Private; Jarvis B. Lutterloh, Lieutenant; George S. Martin,
		  Captain; William Whitmel Martin, Major; George W. McMillan, Private; Stephen D.
		  Richmond, Lieutenant; David W. Simmons, Jr., Lieutenant; Thomas Lucius Smith,
		  Lieutenant; Massillon F. Taylor, Captain; James N. Thompson, Private; Nathan B.
		  Whitfield, Captain; Henry G. Williams, Ensign; John W. Wilson, Lieutenant; E.
		  Eldridge Wright, Captain; John Bradford, Private; James E. Butts, Lieutenant;
		  Wm. A. Dunn, Lieutenant; David H. Froy, Lieutenant; John W. Harris, Lieutenant;
		  Neill E. McCaskill, Private; James C. McClelland, Private; Mitchell S.
		  Prudhomme, Private; Lucius R. A. Pearce, Private.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) was conferred on Aaron
		  Vail Brown, a graduate of 1814, late Representative in Congress, Governor of
		  Tennessee, and then Postmaster-General; that of Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) on
		  Rev. Wm. Hooper, a graduate of 1809, once Professor in the University
		  heretofore described. The like degree of Master of Arts on Wm. S. Mason and
		  Lucian Holmes.</p>
          <p>President Swain, being himself of prudence in money matters and
		  economical in his habits, attached great importance to the necessity of
		  students keeping out of debt. In 1855 he not only distributed two circulars
		  warning merchants not to transgress the law giving credits to students, but in
		  April, 1856, he induced Governor Bragg and other members of the Executive
		  Committee to issue a circular to the merchants, shopkeepers, traders and others
		  in Chapel Hill, Raleigh, Hillsboro, <pb xml:id="p678" n="678"/>Wilmington and
		  elsewhere in North Carolina, virtually accusing some of them who had maintained
		  a fair character for integrity, of seducing young men entrusted to the honor of
		  “the honest State of North Carolina, into habits of imprudent and
		  unlawful expenditure.” It was threatened that there would be a perfect
		  union of all the authorities of the University to bring down proper punishment
		  upon all violating the provisions of the law. It was roundly asserted that
		  giving credit without proper permission was corrupting the morals of the youth
		  of the country.</p>
          <p>The Committee stated that the University was in a state of
		  unprecedented prosperity, the discipline mild, parental and firm, and general
		  quiet, order and diligence prevail in every department.</p>
          <p>All these efforts to prevent credit being given proved futile. The
		  laws of trade cannot be changed by threats.</p>
          <p>In this year (1857) Col. Walter L. Steele and Rev. Cushing B. Hassell,
		  as a Committee of Trustees, examined the classes. While they found much to
		  praise, the report was so severe as to bad scholarship of certain students,
		  whose names were read from the rostrum, that the Chairman was threatened with a
		  personal attack by one or more of those censured, a threat that he so easily
		  thwarted as to make it probable that nothing more serious than vaporing was
		  intended.</p>
          <p>The report was read by Col. W. L. Steele on the afternoon of
		  Commencement Day, in substance as follows: Comparatively few infractions of the
		  regulations have occurred during the year, and they of a venial nature. The
		  exceptions to this statement are less than ten per cent. of the whole number
		  who have been guilty of riotous and disorderly behavior, the result for the
		  most part of intoxication from spirituous liquors. It was hoped that the public
		  mention of this evil, which has caused more scandal to the University than all
		  other causes combined, would induce reformation of conduct. It was not doubted
		  that the Faculty had been diligent to detect offenders, and it was earnestly
		  recommended to dismiss or suspend every student found in a state of
		  intoxication. For minor offences a demerit roll was recommended and dismission
		  should follow the attainment of a given number of demerits.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p679" n="679"/>
          <p>The Committee thought that the corps of instructors was never more
		  able and faithful. As suggested by Prof. Charles Phillips, purchase should be
		  made of additional instruments and apparatus and an Observatory erected in
		  which there should be a telescope “of greater or less dimensions.”
		  The lecture system should be adopted in all branches, and illustrative
		  experiments where appropriate.</p>
          <p>In regard to proficiency in studies, the Committee find that
		  “quite a considerable number” are diligently availing themselves of
		  the opportunity of advancement while others seem apparently not to appreciate
		  them, and some have incurred disapprobation. The University is not answering
		  the ends of its institution if it allows graduation without respectable
		  attainments. Parents should be asked to withdraw those not deriving adequate
		  benefit from their studies, and no one should go into an upper class who has
		  not passed an examination on the “general average of his standing in his
		  studies.” Gratification was expressed at the prosperous condition of the
		  University, and the committee asked the Trustees to strengthen the Faculty in
		  repressing vice and advancing the standard of scholarship and good morals.</p>
          <p>An unusual and painful duty was devolved on Governor Thomas Bragg, as
		  Chairman of the Board of Trustees, to announce to the audience the expulsion of
		  two of the students for riotous behavior. The Board of Trustees emphasized
		  their profound disapproval of drinking among the students by passing a law
		  depriving the Faculty of power to reinstate one dismissed for drunkenness,
		  until after the expiration of two months.</p>
          <p>The Board likewise increased the price of tuition to $30.00 per
		  annum. No student was allowed to room in the village until the college rooms
		  were full, an old rule, but of late often broken.</p>

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>DEATH OF DR. MITCHELL.</head>
          <p>On the 27th of June, 1857, in the sixty-fourth year of his age, and in
		  the fortieth year of his service for the University, perished the Senior
		  Professor, Elisha Mitchell. A sketch of his lineage and early life has already
		  been given. Until 1825 <pb xml:id="p680" n="680"/>he presided over Mathematics and
		  Natural Philosophy, introducing the study of Calculus. When Dr. Olmsted was
		  transferred to Yale Dr. Mitchell gladly became Professor of Geology and
		  Mineralogy. He then began the practice of visiting the various sections of the
		  State in order to study their rocky formations, their soils, fauna, flora,
		  rivers and swamps. He was much attracted by the lofty summits of the Black, and
		  explored them at various times, beginning with 1835. He discovered and measured
		  the highest peak, called in his honor Mount Mitchell. Senator Thomas L.
		  Clingham contended that the Doctor had been on a lower peak and claimed the
		  name of the highest peak himself. After a discussion of the question in
		  newspapers, Dr. Mitchell proceeded in the summer of 1857 to make an
		  instrumental survey and obtain the testimony of those who had assisted him in
		  his former barometrical measurement. He had been at the work about two weeks
		  when on the 27th of June, on Saturday afternoon, he undertook alone to journey
		  over the mountain, down the rugged defiles and through the tangled and pathless
		  thickets, in order to reach the settlements on Caney River. His singular
		  self-reliant nature proved his ruin. He slipped over a precipice forty feet
		  high into a deep pool of the Sugar-camp branch of the Cat-tail Fork of the
		  Caney River.</p>
          <p>He was found on Tuesday, July 8th, and was buried at first in
		  Asheville by the desire of his family, but on the 16th of June, 1858, in
		  compliance with the general opinion of its fitness, he was with their consent
		  reinterred on the summit of the loftiest peak east of the Mississippi. One of
		  his former pupils and colleagues in the Faculty, Right Rev. James Hervey Otey,
		  Bishop of Tennessee, conducted the funeral services and delivered a most
		  impressive and eloquent sermon. It was followed by an interesting impromptu
		  address by President Swain. Copies of these discourses, together with a sketch
		  of Dr. Mitchell's life, by Rev. Dr. Charles Phillips, the history of the search
		  for the body by Senator Z. B. Vance, and of the reburial by Mr. Richard H.
		  Battle, together with sundry laudatory resolutions by different public bodies,
		  have been published, with an excellent portrait of the good professor.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p681" n="681"/>
          <p>Dr. Mitchell was a large figure in our University life. His massive,
		  tireless frame, his encyclopedic information and readiness to impart it, his
		  broad humor, his firm, but not narrow <choice><sic>Calvanism</sic><corr>Calvinism</corr></choice>,
		  his genial manners, his laborious reading, his kindness of heart and unfailing
		  generosity, his intrepid spirit, his firm reliance on his opinions, would have
		  made him conspicuous anywhere.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mitchell was personally well known throughout North Carolina by
		  his expeditions, botanical and geological. Everywhere his reputation for
		  learning was high. He wrote valuable articles, which were published in
		  Silliman's Journal, such as “On the Low Country of North Carolina,”
		  1828; “The Geology of the Gold Regions of North Carolina,” 1829; on
		  “Weather's Tube of Safety,” etc., 1830; “The Causes of Winds
		  and Storms,” 1821; “Analysis of the Protogaea of Leibnitz,”
		  1831; “Notices of the High Mountains of North Carolina,” 1839, etc.
		  Similar contributions he continued up to his death. I have already noticed his
		  supposed contributions to the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger,</hi>published at
		  Chapel Hill. He prepared for his classes a manual of Chemistry, the second
		  edition of which was given to the press before his death, but was not
		  published; A Manual of Geology, illustrated by a geological map of North
		  Carolina; a Manual of Natural History, and a collection of facts and dates
		  respecting the History and Geography of the Holy Land.</p>
          <p>He was regarded in this State and by the Alumni of the University
		  elsewhere as intrinsically a very great man. He certainly was possessed of
		  extraordinary natural abilities, and if he had confined himself to a specialty
		  would have been world famous. The following resolutions of the Trustees give
		  without exaggeration their opinion and that of the people of the State
		  generally.</p>
          <p>“His Excellency Gov. Bragg having communicated officially
		  intelligence of the recent sudden and melancholy death of the Rev. Doctor
		  Elisha Mitchell, late Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy in the University
		  of North Carolina, the Executive Committee, in view of his high character as a
		  Christian gentleman, of his arduous, long continued and inestimable services in
		  the academic corps, and his distinguished position <pb xml:id="p682" n="682"/>for
		  the last forty years as a member of the Faculty in the administration of the
		  affairs of the college; in view of his eminent attainments in Literature and
		  Science, his ardent patriotism and public services, consider the present a fit
		  occasion to express their unanimous sentiment of true condolence and sympathy
		  with the widow and family of the deceased, with the officers and members of the
		  college and the people of the whole State, at this sad and overwhelming
		  bereavement; and in the name and on behalf of the whole body of the Trustees of
		  the University, this Committee will cordially unite with other associations and
		  individuals in paying enduring honors to his memory.”</p>
          <p>This offer of co-operation, made in the first gush of sympathy, in the
		  erection of a Mitchell memorial, as frequently happens in similar cases, met
		  with no adequate response. A committee of citizens, mainly of Asheville,
		  consisting of Z. B. Vance, James A. Patton, John A. Dickson, A. S. Merrimon, D.
		  Coleman and W. M. Shipp, in a well written paper, of which Vance was the
		  author, published in the Asheville <hi rend="italics">Spectator</hi>and other
		  journals, called for contributions to the amount of $5,000, for building
		  a granite shaft on Mount Mitchell, but the movement came to nothing. The
		  present iron monument was erected by means of a sum bequeathed by Dr.
		  Mitchell's youngest daughter, Mrs. Eliza N. Grant, Dr. William B. Phillips as
		  the agent of her sister, Miss Margaret Mitchell, superintending and aiding
		  laboriously the difficult work.</p>
          <p>The Faculty of Davidson College, after bearing testimony to the
		  faithfulness of his teaching, adds, “the Church also in this general
		  grief, sorrows most of all, because she has lost in this distinguished
		  philosopher an eminent Christian minister and a noble <choice><sic>examplar</sic><corr>exemplar</corr></choice>of the high and essential harmony of Science and
		  Religion. Through the whole of a long life he was an assiduous and enthusiastic
		  devotee of Science, and to us there is something of a melancholy, poetic
		  grandeur and greatness in the place and manner of his death, whereby Science in
		  burying one of her worthiest sons has hallowed a new Pisgah, which future
		  generations shall know and mark.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p683" n="683"/>
          <p>The <choice><sic>Philanthrophic</sic><corr>Philanthropic</corr></choice>Society spoke of
		  him as “a most able, skillful and learned instructor” * * * a man
		  whom we admired and a friend whom we loved, whose many kind offices and wise
		  counsels we shall sadly miss.” The Dialectic Society recorded their
		  “obligations to him for that high example that the much absorbed and
		  universal student need not, amid such pursuits, divest himself of those homely
		  yet noble qualities which make the benevolent and public-spirited citizen, the
		  courageous magistrate and the humble and sincere Christian.”</p>
          <p>The Faculty of the University in an eloquent and truthful eulogy said,
		  “In the midst of our regrets it affords us a melancholy satisfaction to
		  reflect that he met his death in the cause of Science, and thus, in appropriate
		  keeping with the duties of his life has, in his death, added his name to the
		  list of her honored martyrs.” He was described as the Christian gentleman
		  whose heart, overflowing with the tender sympathies of humanity, made him the
		  ever beneficent friend of the poor and the wretched; as the minister of our
		  Holy Faith, dispensing the precious truths of eternal life to the sinful and
		  wayward; as the watchful friend and faithful guardian of the young; as our
		  associate, who brought experience to our deliberations, and the cheerful
		  playfulness of innocent mirth to our social intercourse.”</p>
          <p>Dr. James Phillips, who succeeded him in the Mathematical Chair, was
		  requested to deliver a funeral discourse and President Swain an eulogy in his
		  honor.</p>
          <p>The Trustees acted with liberality towards his family. They paid his
		  salary to the end of the year and allowed them to retain his residence without
		  rent for six months after his death. They bought his books for $3,500,
		  and his apparatus and cabinet of minerals for $1,000. On the other hand,
		  from the requirement that he should be responsible for all tuition, not donated
		  to the beneficiaries, although credit was often necessarily given at his risk,
		  there was a balance due by him to the University. This was promptly paid by his
		  administrator, Richard J. Ashe, a son-in-law. There was liberality shown in a
		  real estate transaction. In 1844 the Board after the settlement for building
		  the stone wall agreed to make a deed to <pb xml:id="p684" n="684"/>the Doctor for
		  “a small strip of ground near his ice-house, whenever a deed for the same
		  should be presented.” Under this indefinite description a conveyance was
		  made to his heirs of two acres on Cameron Avenue, fronting the University lot
		  occupied by Professor Gore. The heirs were requested to give the University the
		  option for the repurchase if they should ever sell, but when they concluded to
		  part with the property there was no money available. Being so near the
		  University buildings trouble may some day come by reason of this generous
		  gift.</p>
          <p>Dr. Mitchell was succeeded by Wm. James Martin, who was born in
		  Richmond, Virginia, graduated at the University of that State in 1854, having
		  particularly distinguished himself in scientific branches. He was then
		  Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry for three years at Washington
		  College, Pennsylvania. He had the highest recommendations from Professor
		  Maupin, of Chemistry, and many other professors, and well deserved them. His
		  first step after reaching Chapel Hill was to get an appropriation for increased
		  laboratory work. The subjects of Botany and Zoology were dropped and attention
		  was given exclusively to Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology. The Juniors had two
		  recitations and two lectures in Chemistry each week throughout the year, and
		  the Seniors had the same in Mineralogy and Geology. It was announced that a
		  sufficient stock of apparatus and chemicals and a large cabinet of minerals and
		  fossils afford abundant means of illustrations in the several branches of this
		  Department.</p>
          <p>It should be recorded that on the 19th January, 1857, occurred a
		  blizzard analagous to those of our northwestern plains. All Saturday night the
		  wind roared and the snow fell, and the next morning the ground was covered to
		  the depth of about eighteen inches with icy snow. The temperature was so cold
		  for many days thereafter that there was slow melting. Each room had its own
		  fireplace and separate heating. For a week the wood wagons could not run, and
		  there was serious inconvenience and some suffering in consequence. For the
		  first time and perhaps only time in the history of the University all duties
		  were suspended, the suspension lasting from Sunday until Tuesday.</p>

          <p>In the same month Chief Justice Thomas Ruffin, one of the most learned

		  President and members of the Faculty to review the course of studies and
		  consider whether it was not too extended for the time alloted, and if so,
		  whether the remedy should be to lop off some, or extend the curriculum a year
		  or raise the requisite for admission.</p>
          <p>There was no record of any report in response to this resolution.

          <head>COMMENCEMENT OF 1858.</head>
          <p>On Monday night of the Commencement of 1858 Rev. Dr. Moses A. Curtis,
		  Rector of the Episcopal Church at Hillsboro, a learned divine and very
		  distinguished botanist, preached the sermon to the Senior Class. It was a
		  strong argument to prove that a devout recognition of God's glory, whether in
		  the world of mind or matter, raised the soul nearer Him.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday morning Rev. Dr. Francis L. Hawks, at the request of the
		  Historical Society, unfolded most eloquently the truths of the lesson
		  bequeathed to us by Washington in his Farewell Address.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday forenoon Rev. Dr. John Thomas Wheat, of the Philanthropic
		  Society, delivered the Annual Address. His theme was the Proper Relation
		  between Life and Literature. He showed how unprincipled heart and immoral life
		  had ruined many a genius. Truth is essential to real greatness.</p>
          <p>The Declaimers of the Freshman Class on Tuesday evening were John McK.
		  Whitted, of Bladen; Guilford Nicholson, of Halifax; John Bradford, of Alabama;
		  James E. Butts, of Georgia; James M. B. Hunt, of Granville; Joel P. Walker, of
		  Mississippi; Robert S. Clark, Texas; Nicholas L. Williams, of Yadkin County;
		  Thomas T. Allen, Windsor; John W. Pearson, Mississippi; Henry S. Puryear,
		  Huntsville.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday night came the Sophomores: George S. Martin, Tennessee;
		  Louis West, Mississippi; T. Lucius Smith, Tennessee; William T. Nicholson,
		  Halifax; Thomas W. Davis, Franklin County; Iowa M. Royster, Raleigh; Vernon H.
		  Vaughan, Alabama; Pierce M. Butler, South Carolina; Daniel
		  <pb xml:id="p686" n="686"/>R. Coleman, Concord; Walter J. Jones, of Milton; George
		  P. Bryan, Raleigh, and Charles Walsh, Jr., of Alabama.</p>
          <p>The Freshmen were pronounced by the critics too tame, only Bradford
		  rising above mediocrity. The Sophomores were much praised, especially Royster,
		  Coleman, Walsh and West. Whitted, Bradford, Pearson, West and Puryear left
		  before graduation. Whitted joined the army, Bradford also, and was killed at
		  Seven Pines; Pearson was a merchant; West has not been traced; Puryear is a
		  lawyer.</p>
          <p>The prize for the best English Composition was presented on behalf of
		  Dr. Wheat to George L. Wilson, of Newbern, by Dr. F. L. Hawks in his inimitably
		  felicitous manner.</p>
          <p>There were ninety-three graduates, twenty of whom spoke on
		  Thursday:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, Thomas W. Mason, Virginia.</p>
          <p>“A Plea for Ambition,” Robert D. Johnston, Lincoln

          <p>“Josephine; a Poem,” James S. Hill, Stokes County.</p>
          <p>“To Palaion Dramaton Hellenon,” Wm. M. Hammond,

          <p>“The Beautiful; a Poem,” William M. Coleman, Concord.</p>
          <p>Valedictory, Wm. Carey Dowd, Wake County.</p>
          <p>The comments on the speeches were that they were too long, but showed
		  as a rule a high degree of merit. Especially noticed were those of Marsh for
		  its simplicity and good sense; of Lusher and Hervey of a metaphysical kind; the
		  poem of Coleman, both for thought and feeling and for <choice><sic>rythmical</sic><corr>rhythmical</corr></choice>structure. The Greek oration of Hammond, the
		  Latin of Mason, and the German of Morehead were well conceived and well
		  uttered. The reminiscences by the Valedictorian Dowd of the excellence of Dr.
		  Mitchell, and the apostrophe to his spirit as still hovering over us, struck
		  the hearts of the audience.</p>
          <p>The first honor was awarded to Robert W. Anderson, Wm. Carey Dowd, Wm.
		  M. Hammond, Wm. C. Lord, Thomas W. Mason, Leroy M. McAfee, James Turner
		  Morehead and John M. Perry.</p>
          <p>The second to Edward S. Bell, John B. Buchanan, John A. Gilmer, James
		  I. Grover, Robert T. Harris, Addison Harvey, Philip T. Hay, James S. Hill,
		  Robert D. Johnston, Hamilton C. Jones, Nathaniel P. Lusher and Robert H.
		  Marsh.</p>
          <p>The third to James S. Baker, Samuel M. Brinson, Nevin D. J. Clark,
		  Samuel W. Clement, Wm. M. Coleman, David S. Goodloe, Oscar F. Hadley, Francis
		  M. Johnson, Thomas N. Macartney, Daniel Stewart, William L. Twitty, James A.
		  Walker, William H. Young.</p>
          <p>The Faculty noted that the class was distinguished by a larger number
		  than usual of able and upright men.</p>
          <p>Of the first honor men Anderson was a Lieutenant, killed at the
		  Wilderness; Dowd was a Tutor, U. N. C., died early; Hammond was a Captain, a
		  prominent lawyer in Georgia and member of the Legislature; Lord was a Captain,
		  killed in battle; Mason a Captain, State Senator and member of the Corporation
		  Commission; Morehead a Colonel and President of <pb xml:id="p688" n="688"/>the
		  Senate; McAfee a Colonel, member of the Legislature and a very able lawyer.</p>
          <p>Of the others Gilmer was a Colonel, State Senator, Trustee of the
		  University, and Judge of the Superior Court; Harvey a Captain of Harvey's
		  Scouts, killed at Atlanta; R. D. Johnston a strong lawyer and banker, and a
		  Brigadier-General; Jones a leader of the Charlotte bar and U. S. District
		  Attorney; Marsh a Baptist preacher and often President of the State
		  Association; Coleman Attorney-General and an author; Macartney a Confederate
		  soldier, County Solicitor and Adjutant-General of Georgia.</p>
          <p>Of those not gaining honors Hilliard was a Captain, a member of the
		  Legislature and Superior Court Judge; Phillips also a Captain and Superior
		  Court Judge; Richmond a Surgeon C. S. A. and prominent physician in
		  Missouri.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates not graduating John F. Miller was a physician and
		  Superintendent of the Hospital for the Insane at Goldsboro.</p>
          <p>The list of the matriculates of 1858 belonging to the
		  “Confederate dead” still shows an increase—thirty-six in
		  number: Edward H. Armstrong, Captain; Joseph H. Bason, Sergeant; Luther R.
		  Bell, Private; James J. Cherry, Captain; Joseph D. Cherry, Private; Weldon E.
		  Davis, Captain; John H. Dobbin, Private; John C. Gaines, Captain; John L.
		  Haughton, Private; Thomas C. Holliday, Captain; James P. Jenkins, Lieutenant;
		  Aurelius C. Jones, ——; John T. Jones, Lieutenant-Colonel; James S.
		  Knight, Lieutenant; Thomas Benjamin Davidson, Private; Jacob F. Foster,
		  Private; Robert F. Fulton, Captain; John F. Lightfoot, Private; Albert G.
		  Moore, Lieutenant; Harrison P. Lyon, Lieutenant; Richardson Mallett,
		  Lieutenant; William T. Nuckolls, Captain; Augustus M. Parker, Private; Oliver
		  T. Parks, Lieutenant; Charles E. Riddick, Lieutenant; Jesse G. Ross,
		  ——; Jesse W. Siler, Lieutenant; Rufus S. Siler, Lieutenant; James
		  M. Smith, Private; Samuel T. Snow, Lieutenant; Reuell A. Stancil, Private;
		  Archibald T. Staton, Lieutenant; Simon H. Taylor, Private; John M. Sutton;
		  Lawson W. Sykes; James Milton Tomlinson, Sergeant.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p689" n="689"/>
          <p>The attendance on the occasion might be called brilliant. All
		  regretted the absence of the Secretary, ex-Governor Manly, detained by
		  sickness, and of Dr. Elisha Mitchell, both familiar figures for about two
		  scoreyears.</p>
          <p>In 1858 the Examining Committee were Judge W. H. Battle, Hon. D. M.
		  Barringer, W. F. Leake, Esq., and Hon. S. P. Hill. Judge Battle, as Chairman,
		  read the report on Commencement Day. It praised highly “many of the
		  students,” and to them was given the high credit of sustaining the
		  reputation of the University. The Committee turned with feelings of sadness to
		  many, too many, who “went through all the grades of poor
		  scholarship” on their examinations. “To the questions of the
		  examiners they either maintained a profound silence, or returned answers so
		  wide of the mark as to show that the subject had never before engaged their
		  attention.”</p>
          <p>The Committee were sorry to notice that the better scholars seemed to
		  have devoted more of their attention to some textbooks than to others.</p>
          <p>The demeanor of the students had been good on the whole. The cases of
		  disorder proceeded more from heedlessness than a deliberate purpose to injure
		  the University. Praise was given to the ability and faithfulness of the
		  Faculty. Nothing was wanting but persevering attention to duty on the part of
		  the students to cause our noble Alma Mater to be as great as the proudest in
		  the land.</p>
          <p>The Tutors addressed to the Board a temperate communication in the
		  handwriting of Solomon Pool to the effect that the small salaries paid them
		  deprived them of any inducement to remain long in the service of the
		  University. This discouragement was increased by not promoting those who were
		  worthy to professorships, but instead going into other States for professors.
		  It was suggested that salaries proportioned to length of service and promotion
		  of those qualified adopted as the policy of the Trustees would remove these
		  difficulties. At present the lower classes who especially need good instruction
		  are taught by inexperienced men, who, as soon as they become skilled, are
		  forced to go into more remunerative pursuits. The signers were Solomon Pool,
		  who wrote the paper, R. W. Anderson, <pb xml:id="p690" n="690"/>Samuel S. Jackson,
		  William L. Alexander and Wm. Carey Dowd. They recommended $700 for the
		  first year, $800 for the second, $900 for the third and
		  afterwards, with an additional allowance to the Senior Tutor of $100
		  yearly.</p>
          <p>Fighting was not common as in the early years of the century, and when
		  it occurred the combatants were soon parted. If they were likely to renew the
		  combat they were carried before Dr. Mitchell, who was a Justice of the Peace,
		  and bound over to keep the peace. Occasionally a troublesome fellow, who was
		  getting the worst of it, was allowed to be well whipped before interference by
		  the bystanders. Firearms were seldom used. I told of the case of Evans shooting
		  McRae through the arm while hazing. Watson was killed by Ford, who was
		  acquitted on the plea of self-defence. One Cheek, not in the University, was
		  killed by a student, a case of self-defence. In this case a well-known
		  prostitute was called as a material witness. Dr. Mitchell testified that her
		  character for truth was as good as that of any woman in the county. Such was
		  the general opinion of her neighbors. There was another instance of an
		  infuriated student by accident stabbing badly a friend who endeavored to
		  prevent the wounding of another. These cases occurred after the University
		  increased in numbers, within a few years before the war.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="section">
          <head>LAWLESSNESS—THE PRESIDENT'S CIRCULAR.</head>
          <p>It was in these days, when the minds of many were unsettled by the
		  portentious rumblings of the coming war and the angry passions of political
		  strife, that in 1858 a lawless club was formed, the members pledged to stand by
		  one another in their breaches of University rules. Spirituous liquor was drunk,
		  the air was filled at late hours with direful uproars and furious din, the bell
		  was rung violently and unceasingly, or the clapper was stolen and hid, in fact
		  all disorder committed which ingenuity could devise, and when the Faculty
		  endeavored to restore order, stones were thrown at them with dangerous
		  accuracy. Finally the benches and black-boards were collected from the
		  recitation rooms and piled for a huge bonfire. The leaders were expelled and,
		  suit being brought against them in the Superior Court of Orange, they were
		  compelled <pb xml:id="p691" n="691"/>to reimburse the University for the damages
		  sustained, about $200.</p>
          <p>These outrages, coupled with rumors of others, gave the public such
		  opinion of want of discipline at the University that the President thought it
		  necessary to issue an elaborate circular on the subject to the friends of the
		  institution. I give its substance:</p>
          <p>He began by quoting from a similar circular by Dr. Caldwell, of which
		  I copy the concluding sentence: “How unjust it is that calumny must be
		  forever watching as if with a lynx's eye, the disorders of a few wrong-headed
		  young people, who are mixed up in a college with the body of students, and then
		  proceed to multiply and misrepresent and aggravate until the country is at
		  length led to believe that the institution could not be worse if even filled
		  with a parcel of inveterate demons.”</p>
          <p>The President continued, “In modern times the Institution has
		  been treated with much greater charity * * * than the foregoing statement would
		  indicate, * * * but exaggerated accounts of occurrences have found their way
		  into the newspapers.”</p>
          <p>The most important occurrence of the year was the interest on the
		  subject of religion, which resulted in an unprecedented accession to the
		  various churches. A riot shortly afterwards, participated in by a tenth or
		  twentieth of the students, for which the ring-leaders were severely punished,
		  created a stronger impression on the public because so incongruous with the
		  religious revival. Those engaged in the outrage met with such disapproval on
		  the part of more than nine-tenths of their fellows that there was danger of a
		  collision between them. The proceedings of the two Literary Societies, adopted
		  with great unanimity, prove that the great body of the students did not
		  sympathize with the malefactors.</p>
          <p>The wounding almost to death of a student by one of the fellows was an
		  accident. In sixty-four years only two serious wounds, and one of these by
		  accident, have been received. There is a strong by-law against having deadly
		  weapons, and the aid of patrons for enforcing it is earnestly requested.</p>
          <p>The President hardly deemed it worth while to mention the warlike
		  correspondence which appeared in the papers last fall. <pb xml:id="p692" n="692"/>
		  One of the young men had ceased to be a student before the affair was known,
		  and the other was disciplined immediately when it was discovered. This of
		  course refers to an abortive duel.</p>
          <p>The President affirmed that the subordination and general quiet for
		  the last ten years equalled that of any like period since the foundation.
		  “Dr. Caldwell was frequently called upon to correct public sentiment as
		  to the condition of things here forty or fifty years ago. In the course of
		  these appeals he states facts that show that in those days among some fifty
		  students there was a worse state of things than has existed among the three of
		  four hundred that have crowded here <choice><sic>durthe</sic><corr>during the [?]</corr></choice>
		  last half dozen years. * * * The balance of results from the extraordinary
		  occurrences of the session has been vastly in favor of good.”</p>

          <head>NEW CALDWELL MONUMENT.</head>
          <p>On June 2nd, 1858, the Committee on the erection of the new Caldwell
		  Monument, reported that their commission had been executed and that the
		  monument was ready to be dedicated; that ex-Governor Charles Manly, who had
		  consented to deliver the eulogy on President Caldwell, was prevented by
		  sickness, and that the President of the Association, Mr. Cameron, although he
		  had short notice, would take his place.</p>
          <p>A procession of the Alumni, preceded by music, marched from their
		  place of meeting, the Library in Smith Hall, to the monument. Standing around
		  it they sang the Doxology and joined in a prayer offered by Rev. Dr. James
		  Phillips. The procession then moved to Gerrard Hall, where all Alumni who had
		  been pupils of Dr. Caldwell, took their seats on the rostrum. Hon. John H.
		  Bryan (1815) and Maj. Charles L. Hinton (1814) were the escort of the orator.
		  The address was most appropriate and in excellent taste, the orator having
		  strong personal regard for the subject of his eulogy, as well as admiration of
		  his clients, his virtues and services to the University and to the State. The
		  following extract from a printed address by Mr. Cameron in 1885, at the
		  dedication of Memorial Hall, shows the character of his eulogy on this
		  occasion:</p>

            <p>“These words must ever call up the memory, form and
		  characteristics of Joseph Caldwell, and will, as long as these walls by which
		  we are surrounded shall stand, or this pleasant village is known as the seat of
		  learning; and so long as the name of the University is on the map, it will be
		  associated with that of the first President. To leave it out would be as if the
		  topographer should present us with Switzerland without its profile of
		  mountains, or old Egypt without its overflowing and fertilizing Nile, or our
		  own vast North American Continent without the great Father of Waters, in his
		  grand sweep from the lakes of the North to the Gulf of Mexico. The good man
		  needs no eulogy at my hands, and no praise of mine can add a cubit to his
		  stature. His early struggles in its behalf must stand alone in the building up
		  of this institution. He came like Paul to plant, and then like Apollos to water
		  with his tears, prayers, benedictions and benefactions to the end of his
		  days—a continuous effort of thirty-one years.”</p>
            <p>“It is a pleasant memory to the surviving Alumni to recall the
		  steady devotion of good President Caldwell to this institution and his complete

          <p>After the address the benediction was pronounced by Rev. Dr.
		  Hawks.</p>
          <p>At a subsequent meeting Maj. Charles L. Hinton was elected President
		  of the Alumni Association.</p>
          <p>The thanks of the Association were returned to the Wilmington and
		  Weldon and the North Carolina Railroad Companies for their liberality in
		  transporting the monument free of charge; to Paul C. Cameron for his enterprise
		  and generosity in providing the apparatus and hauling so ponderous a mass of
		  marble from Durham to Chapel Hill; and to the Committee, <pb xml:id="p694" n="694"/>
		  President Swain, Judge Battle and Mr. Wm. J. Bingham, for their prolonged
		  attention to the business and their skill and good taste in executing it.</p>
          <p>The monument, from the works of Struther &amp; Co., Philadelphia, is
		  an obelisk of white marble over twenty feet high, and stands about half way
		  between the South Building and Franklin Street. It is near the venerable Davie
		  Poplar. A tablet toward the top bears as emblems of Dr. Caldwell's services to
		  the State and to religion, a railroad wheel, and engineer's transit, and the
		  Holy Bible. The inscriptions on the faces are as follows:</p>
          <p>On the South face—</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“He was an early, conspicuous and devoted advocate of the Cause

        <div2 type="section">
          <head>ELECTION OF PROFESSORS.</head>
          <p>In 1859 there were changes in the Faculty. Rev. Andrew D. Hepburn was
		  elected in December to the chair of Rhetoric and Logic, and entered on his
		  duties the next year. Prof. Hepburn was about thirty years old, the eldest son
		  of Judge Samuel Hepburn, of Pennsylvania, a man of legal learning and good
		  fortune. The son graduated early with the highest honors from Jefferson
		  College, and then spent two years at the University of Virginia. After twelve
		  months devoted to general reading, he spent three years in Princeton
		  Theological Seminary, and obtained his degree and license to preach. He then
		  exercised his ministry in Rockingham and Rockbridge counties in Virginia. His
		  preaching was strong and often eloquent, his manners modest, retiring and those
		  of a Christian gentleman. He was pronounced by his preceptor, the distinguished
		  Dr. W. H. McGuffey, of the University of Virginia, to have special aptitude in
		  psychological studies. He obtained the highest rank in his classes, and was
		  pronounced to be “thoroughly acquainted with all that is requisite to
		  ensure success in teaching Logic, Rhetoric, together with criticism and correct
		  expression (with pen or orally) of whatever thoughts may convince or
		  persuade.”</p>
          <p>There were about thirty letters from eminent scholars and public men
		  sustaining this estimate of Dr. Hepburn's qualifications, though not in such
		  detail. His career here showed that they were not overdrawn.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p696" n="696"/>
          <p>For fear that his father being a Pennsylvania man might prejudice the
		  Trustees against him, Dr. A. T. Bledsoe, whose Southern proclivities were well
		  known, testified that to his personal knowledge, Judge Hepburn, under trying
		  circumstances had upheld the national laws in favor of our rights. His son had
		  cast his lot with us.</p>
          <p>At a special meeting of the Board held in July, 1859, the resignation
		  of Rev. Dr. A. M. Shipp, as Professor of History, was accepted, and Rev.
		  Francis L. Hawks, D.D., LL.D., was chosen unanimously in his place. At a
		  subsequent meeting Dr. Hawks declined because of the meagre salary, and the
		  Board directed President Swain to ascertain whether and on what terms he would
		  accept the position of Lecturer on American History and kindred subjects. No
		  arrangement was made, and at the December meeting Rev Charles F. Deems, D.D.,
		  was chosen Professor. He also declined the appointment, and the chair was left
		  vacant, doubtless on account of the falling off of patronage caused by the
		  threatening political issues.</p>
          <p>The election of two Virginians, both of them Presbyterians, Professors
		  Martin and Hepburn, caused attacks in the press fierce and illnatured on the
		  policy of the Trustees. President Swain was so galled that he made an elaborate
		  reply to what he called misconception and misrepresentations.</p>
          <p>He began by stating that when he was elected in 1835 the name of an
		  Episcopal clergyman was withdrawn because Judge Cameron took the ground that,
		  while clergymen might be Professors, the President should be a layman. When he
		  entered on his duties the Faculty consisted of Professor Mitchell and Phillips,
		  Presbyterian preachers, though neither was a member of the Presbyterian Church
		  at the time of his election; Dr. Hooper, a Baptist clergyman; of Professor
		  Burgevin, a Roman Catholic, and of Tutors McAllister and Owen, one a
		  Presbyterian and the other of Methodist family. The religious services were
		  conducted on alternate Sundays by Drs. Mitchell and Hooper. When the latter
		  resigned in 1838 efforts were made, as has been narrated, to procure Rev.
		  Edward Wadsworth as Chaplain. His assent was procured, and also the approval of
		  Rev. Hezekiah G. Leigh, Presiding Elder, but the project was vetoed by Bishop
		  Thomas A. Morris. It was thought impracticable to procure the services of a
		  Baptist or <pb xml:id="p697" n="697"/>Methodist, and Rev. Wm. M. Green, the first
		  Episcopal minister ever chosen, was created Chaplain and Professor of
		  Rhetoric.</p>
          <p>When the Trustees met to choose a successor to Professor Hooper, as
		  Professor of Ancient Languages, there were three names before the Board:
		  Professors Henry Tutwiler, of Alabama; Wm. E. Anderson, then of Hillsboro, and
		  Manuel Fetter, of New York. Judge Cameron stated that in his opinion the Board
		  should choose no one without the concurrence of the President, who, like the
		  captain of a vessel, should have the privilege of selecting his crew. Judge
		  Gaston followed, taking the same position. The President then stated that Mr.
		  Anderson was a most estimable man, but in scholarship hardly equal to the
		  others, and that he was prepared to nominate Mr. Tutwiler as the choice of
		  himself and the Faculty. Unfortunately, however, his name had just been
		  withdrawn by letter, and his preference now was Mr. Fetter. Mr. Tutwiler was a
		  Methodist, both the others Episcopalians.</p>
          <p>In 1842 Rev. C. F. Deems, a Methodist, was appointed to an adjunct
		  professorship. In 1849 Rev. Albert M. Shipp, a Methodist, was elected Professor
		  of History.</p>
          <p>No instance was known since the foundation of the University, where a
		  Methodist has competed unsuccessfully for either a Professorship or Tutorship.
		  As now organized, there are two Episcopalian, two Presbyterian, and two
		  Methodist clergymen in the corps of instructors. A Baptist was sought for to
		  fill the last vacancy, but none came forward. The President stated to the Board
		  before the vote for a successor to Dr. Mitchell was had, that, as this was a
		  State institution, all denominations should be represented in the Faculty;
		  that, other things being equal, he would prefer a Baptist and next a Methodist,
		  a graduate of this University, to one from another institution, and a southern
		  to a northern man.</p>
          <p>As to the Board of Trustees, while the Episcopalians are most
		  numerous, he thought that the Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists are about
		  equal in numbers.</p>
          <p>The Executive Committee of seven, residing in and near Raleigh, are
		  composed only of Episcopalians and Methodists, politically four Democrats and
		  three Whigs.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p698" n="698"/>
          <p>The Board of Trustees has never departed from the principles of wise
		  liberality and Christian charity. “During the last quarter of a century
		  there have been more than 150 members of the Board, and it is no more than
		  justice to the living and the dead to say that no similar number can be found
		  of equal ability, attainments, wealth and influence.” The present state
		  of the institution affords satisfactory evidence that their fostering care has
		  been crowned with the only reward they coveted. Its numbers have increased
		  five-fold, and its revenues and means of influence in still greater proportion.
		  It is believed that at present there is but one institution in the Union which
		  has in its regular classes a larger number of undergraduates.”</p>

          <head>THE BUCHANAN COMMENCEMENT, 1859.</head>
          <p>The Commencement of 1859 was conspicuous on account of the presence of
		  the President of the United States, James Buchanan, who, however, did not
		  arrive until Wednesday. He missed therefore a sermon and an address, both of
		  extraordinary power. The sermon was on Monday night, specially to the
		  graduating class. The preacher was Rev. David S. Doggett, afterwards a Bishop
		  of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. It was on Paul in Athens, the centre
		  of the educational world in his day. He showed how necessary it was, and is, to
		  supplement the philosophy of the world with the religion of Christ.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday evening the Freshmen Declaimers performed their parts. They
		  were Henry C. Wall, of Richmond County; William M. Fetter, of Chapel Hill;
		  Aurelius C. Jones, of Texas; William M. Jones, of Henderson; Thomas S. Webb, of
		  Tennessee; Andrew J. Moore, of Pitt County; Wm. C. Jordan, of Greenville; John
		  H. Bass, of Georgia; Herbert M. Varner, of Georgia; Leonidas P. Wheat, Chapel
		  Hill. Messrs. Jordan, Varner and Wheat were most praised.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday forenoon the address before the two Literary Societies
		  was delivered by Hon. Duncan K. MacRae, a University student in 1837, lately
		  Consul to Paris, and afterwards a Colonel in the Confederate service. His
		  subject was the Cultivated Intellect—the Equal of Genius. He fully
		  sustained his reputation for brilliancy and eloquence.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p699" n="699"/>
          <p>The President and his suite, accompanied by a large escort of
		  citizens, all covered with the dust of travel, reached the village soon after
		  the conclusion of Colonel MacRae's oration. With him was Hon. Jacob Thompson,
		  Secretary of the Interior, a graduate of the Class of 1831. They were received
		  by President Swain and the Faculty, students, villagers and visitors. The
		  speeches of welcome and reply were said to be gems of their kind, but were not
		  reported, because the two reporters of the <hi rend="italics">New York
		  Herald,</hi>and those of the <hi rend="italics">Richmond Dispatch</hi>and
		  <hi rend="italics">Fayetteville Carolinian</hi>had been unable from the
		  crowded state of the road to reach Chapel Hill in season. After the speaking,
		  the President and the Secretary repaired to the residence of President Swain,
		  whose guests they were.</p>
          <p>At half-past two, by invitation of President Swain, a large number of
		  guests, Trustees, prominent visitors, Faculty, Seniors, dined with President
		  Buchanan and his Secretary under the lofty trees of his front yard. Long rows
		  of luscious eatables were ranged on long tables, but no wines nor other
		  alcoholic stimulants in any form. Blooming young ladies were efficient
		  volunteer waitresses. There were no speeches, owing to the necessity of
		  repairing to Gerrard Hall, in order to listen to the addresses before the
		  Alumni Association, by Rev. Dr. William Hooper, of the Class of 1809. When the
		  roll of graduates by classes was called only one appeared older than he, Gen.
		  Wm. James Cowan, of 1808. The address, entitled “Fifty Years
		  Since,” was a masterly effort. It was composed of two parts, the first a
		  humorous description of the University of 1805-09, with laughable stories of
		  students and professors, the second of wise counsels, drawn from his experience
		  of colleges and men. His earnest appeals to young men to avoid intemperance led
		  to President Buchanan's words on the same subject in presenting to E. E.
		  Wright, of Tennessee, the English prize at night, when he said, “We bring
		  upon ourselves a greater calamity than is brought upon us by the yellow fever
		  or any of the pestilences that afflict our citizens.”</p>
          <p>On Wednesday night came on the Sophomores: Thomas T. Allen, of
		  Windsor; Guilford Nicholson, of Halifax; Robert S. Clark, of Texas; John H.
		  Dobbin, Fayetteville; Stephen M. <pb xml:id="p700" n="700"/>Routh, Louisiana;
		  Oliver T. Parks, Wilkes County; Henry J. Hogan, Chapel Hill; John Bradford,
		  Alabama; Charles M. Stedman, of Fayetteville, and Eli S. Shorter, of Georgia.
		  Those most deserving of credit were said to be Messrs. Routh, Dobbin, Stedman,
		  Bradford, and Shorter.</p>
          <p>During the exercises Dr. Wheat led to the rostrum the successful
		  competitor in English Composition, Elisha E. Wright, of Memphis, Tenn., and
		  requested the President to present the prize, Hawk's History of North Carolina.
		  The President's remarks were peculiarly felicitous. It is gratifying to record
		  that the importance of using short sentences was insisted on. The ancient style
		  is the best style, and that is emphatically the style of Mr. Calhoun, and in an
		  eminent degree the style of Mr. Webster. He most impressively depicted the
		  evils of drunkenness, and urged all to beware of intoxicating liquors.</p>
          <p>On Thursday at 9 o'clock the Marshals conducted a procession of the
		  military company, the Faculty, students and citizens from the residence of
		  President Swain to the Chapel. The music was by the Richmond Armory band. When
		  the head of the column entered the Hall, Presidents Buchanan and Swain in
		  front, the audience rose and cheered. The lower floor was filled with ladies,
		  Faculty, students and distinguished visitors. The correspondent of the
		  <hi rend="italics">New York Herald</hi>wrote that “the ladies were
		  dressed in a style of gorgeous splendor, surpassing anything I have seen
		  outside of the fashionable city of New York. Their beauty accords well with
		  this graceful display.”</p>
          <p>On the stage, besides President Buchanan and Secretary Thompson, were
		  President Swain, Governor Ellis, ex-Governor Morehead, Judge Battle, Thomas
		  Bragg, U. S. Senator J. H. Weller, late Minister to Nicarauga, Rev. Dr. F. M.
		  Hubbard, Professor of Latin.</p>
          <p>The exercises were opened with a most devout and appropriate prayer by
		  Rev. Dr. Hubbard. Wm. Bingham Lynch followed with the Latin Salutatory, which
		  gave all the more pleasure because it contained a goodly number of phrases like
		  <hi rend="italics">“<foreign xml:lang="lat">formosissimae
		  puellae</foreign>,”</hi>with appropriate glances at the ladies. The
		  other speakers in order were:</p>
          <p>“The Hamiltonian System,” Thomas W. Harris, of Chatham
		  County.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p701" n="701"/>
          <p>“Objection to an Elective Judiciary,” Mills L. Eure, Gates
		  County.</p>
          <p>“The Imagination to be Cultivated,” Richard W. Nixon.</p>
          <p>“The Persecution of the Jews,” Cicero S. Croom, of New
		  York.</p>
          <p>“The Man of Letters,” James L. Gaines, Knoxville.</p>
          <p>“The Common Sense Man,” William F. Foster.</p>
          <p>“The Independent Thinker,” Franklin C. Robbins.</p>
          <p>“The American Student,” Berryman Green, Danville.</p>
          <p>“To be Great is to be Misunderstood,” Benjamin L.
		  Gill.</p>
          <p>“Comparative Merits of Curriculum Colleges,” Frederick A.
		  Fetter, Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The morning exercises closing here, President Swain announced that
		  President Buchanan and Secretary Thompson would hold an informal reception
		  under the Davie Poplar. Large numbers, including all the ladies present, paid
		  their respects to them shaded by the historic tree, then in its vigor and
		  beauty, before the lightning and the fierce wind had shattered it. It is
		  observable that there was no kissing, except that the President gallantly
		  obtained this favor from one pretty girl, and deputized her to impart it to
		  others.</p>
          <p>At 3.30 o'clock, after dinner, the company reassembled. The first
		  speaker was Francis D. Stockton, on <foreign xml:lang="ger">Die Deutsche
		  Sprache</foreign>, in German; then Elijah B. Withers, on Benedict Arnold;
		  Charles W. McClammy, on Political Influence of Educated Men. The German speech
		  was said to be uncommonly accurate, interesting and well delivered. The
		  Valedictory, by George Burgwyn Johnston, was appropriate, practical and
		  affecting. After that President Swain called up the graduates and delivered
		  them their diplomas and to each a Bible.</p>
          <p>The annual report was then read. The first honor men of the Seniors
		  were Thomas W. Harris, of Chatham; George B. Johnston, Edenton; Wm. Bingham
		  Lynch, of Orange County; and Francis D. Stockton, Statesville.</p>
          <p>The second honor went to C. Stephens Croom, of New York; Mills L.
		  Eure, Gates County; Isaac R. Ferguson, of Georgia; Frederick A. Fetter, Chapel
		  Hill; Wilbur F. Foster, Alabama; James L. Gaines, Asheville; Benjamin L. Gill,
		  of Franklin County; Berryman Green, and James C. Green, Danville,
		  <pb xml:id="p702" n="702"/>Va., Charles W. McClammy, Jr., and Richard W. Nixon, New
		  Hanover County; Franklin C. Robbins, and James C. Robbins, of Randolph County;
		  Elijah B. Withers, of Caswell County.</p>
          <p>The third best were Richard C. Badger, of Raleigh; John W. Cole,
		  Richmond County; John T. Cook, Warrenton; Simmons H. Isler, Goldsboro; George
		  D. Jones, of Texas; Calvin N. Morrow, Alamance County; George M. Pillow,
		  Tennessee; William J. Rogers, Northampton County; Wm. W. Sillers, Clinton;
		  Richard S. Webb, Alamance County, and John A. Woodburn, Guilford County.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Fetter and McClammy never failed to answer to any of the 4,700
		  roll-calls during their four years' course. There were eighty-six Bachelors of
		  Arts graduates, and six Bachelors of Science, in the course recently
		  established. The correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">New York Herald</hi>
		  reported that “whenever any member of the class, deemed by his classmates
		  unworthy of a diploma, was called, a shout was raised, which of course was
		  meant in irony. This brought a blush to the cheek of the unfortunate
		  beneficiary, and he hurried from the rostrum with all possible haste to avoid
		  this significent and humiliating display.” This statement is certainly
		  misleading. Applause was not often, if ever, for the reason assigned. It was
		  sometimes given for personal popularity, sometimes for some college joke,
		  sometimes because the recipient had obtained the honor after repeated trials,
		  sometimes because he was the college wag.</p>
          <p>Of the first honor men Harris finished his medical education in Paris,
		  was a Captain of Cavalry, a physician of acknowledged skill, Professor of
		  Anatomy and Materia Medica in the University of North Carolina; Johnston was a
		  Tutor in the University, and Captain; he died in service; Lynch was a
		  Lieutenant and able co-partner in the Bingham School, then Principal of a
		  Military Academy at High Point, and in Florida; Stockton was a Lieutenant, a
		  lawyer of great promise, but died early.</p>
          <p>Of the others, Eure was a Superior Court Judge, and then a commission
		  merchant in Norfolk; Gaines a Colonel and Comptroller of Tennessee; Croom a
		  Major and city attorney of <pb xml:id="p703" n="703"/>Mobile; Berryman Green a
		  Colonel and Judge of the U. S. District Court; McClammy a Major, planter,
		  Presidential Elector, Representative in the Legislature and in Congress; Badger
		  a Major, member of the General Assembly, and of the Convention of 1875, and U.
		  S. District Attorney.</p>
          <p>Of those obtaining no honors, Field was in the Mississippi
		  Legislature, and Adjutant and Inspector-General; Bein an Adjutant-General of
		  the Confederacy, and a lawyer in Arkansas; Kolb Commissioner of Agriculture in
		  Tennessee; Latham a Major, and Representative in the Legislature and in
		  Congress; Thompson a Captain, President of the Texas Senate, and Lieutenant
		  Governor.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates matriculating with the class, Elias Carr was a
		  planter and Governor of this State; Hugh L. Cole was a Major, and Assistant
		  Corporation Counsel of New York City.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Bachelor of Arts was conferred on Rev. Lewis H.
		  Shuck a graduate of Wake Forest College, of unusual merits, for special
		  reasons, and of Master of Arts on Hon. Robert R. Heath, Judge of the Superior
		  Court; the degree of Doctor of Laws on Judge Mitchell D. King, of South
		  Carolina, Right Rev. James H. Otey, Episcopal Bishop of Tennessee, and on James
		  Buchanan, President of the United States.</p>
          <p>On the afternoon of Commencement day Judge Battle, on behalf of the
		  Committee of Examiners, read their report. The University was in a most
		  prosperous condition; number of students 456, with instructors consisting of a
		  President, nine professors and five tutors. Two large additional buildings have
		  been contracted for. It had scarcely a superior, and few equals, in the United
		  States.</p>
          <p>The Committee regretted to find in too many of the students great want
		  of interest in their studies. This <choice><sic>direliction</sic><corr>dereliction</corr></choice>is
		  as a rule most conspicuous in those who spend the most money. They are exhorted
		  to greater diligence in study and stricter attention to the recitation rooms.
		  Especial praise was given to the applicants for the degrees of Bachelor of
		  Science.</p>
          <p>The evils of extravagance in dress and other expenditures, and of the
		  use of intoxicating liquors were emphasized. “Intemperance is a great,
		  damning sin of our country, and it is <pb xml:id="p704" n="704"/>not to be wondered
		  at that it has found its way into our institution.” Gratification was
		  expressed that President Buchanan had the evening before so well and strongly
		  denounced its evils. The importance of attention to studies was well
		  illustrated by the statement of the Alumni Orator, John Y. Mason, late
		  Secretary of the Navy, that one of the brightest recollections of his life was
		  the pleasure he felt when he went home from the Freshman Class in this
		  institution and told his father that he had obtained first distinction.</p>
          <p>I have given the substance of the reports of the Examining Trustees,
		  which are on record. Being busy men in State and church and in private affairs,
		  it was naturally inconvenient for the appointees to perform this duty. For
		  example, in 1855 Chief Justice Ruffin, and Messrs. John Gray Bynum, Robert B.
		  Gilliam, Calvin Graves, and Lewis Thompson were selected, but not one appeared.
		  The duty itself was tedious and uninteresting beyond description. The students
		  wondered whether the eminent examiners, grown gray in the successful
		  prosecution of their respective professions, remembered their classics and
		  mathematics so accurately as to detect the mistakes of the answers.</p>
          <p>The company was larger than ever seen before, and there was much
		  sleeping on floors and other similar humble couches. All the reports are
		  emphatic in praising the sobriety and orderly behavior of students, as well as
		  visitors. The President was treated with extraordinary respect, and his
		  demeanor, as well as speeches, were eminently worthy of the chief magistrate of
		  our great country.</p>
          <p>The hospitality of the housekeepers among the Faculty was strained to
		  the utmost. It was common to have long tables filled three times every meal.
		  The hotels and boarding <choice><sic>bouses</sic><corr>houses</corr></choice>of course had many
		  times more, but gave general satisfaction.</p>
          <p>All the old carriages of whatever name, shape or age were brought out,
		  drawn by improvised matches of horses and mules, for transporting the visitors,
		  estimated at twenty-five hundred at least, from and to Durham. In addition many
		  a springless wagon was turned into a passenger coach. The reporter of the
		  <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Standard,</hi>probably John Spelman, stated that he
		  and “twenty-one others were conveyed to Durham <pb xml:id="p705" n="705"/>in
		  a <hi rend="italics">machine</hi>(for we can give it no other name) at the
		  rate of about two miles an hour, paying $2 per head, $44.00 for
		  one load for twelve miles.”</p>
          <p>With the exception of the criticism as to the treatment of the press
		  reporters, which was a mere oversight, the Chief Marshal, Thomas W. Davis, and
		  assistants, Vernon H. Vaughan, Charles Bruce, Sydenham B. Alexander, and Wm. T.
		  Nicholson, won laurels by the firm and respectful discharge of their duties.
		  Those who frequented the dance gave similar praise to Mr. Pierce M. Butler,
		  Chief Ball Manager, and his assistants, W. A. Cherry, J. W. Mebane, J. R. Bowie
		  and Horace Ferrand.</p>
          <p>For the first time a military company, the Wilmington Light Infantry,
		  attended our Commencement. Of course it was in honor of the President. They
		  were under the command of Captain Edwin D. Hall, and were in good discipline,
		  and added much to the ceremonies. They were encamped in the Northeast part of
		  the campus, and entertained, and were entertained by, their friends freely.
		  Indeed many a homeless visitor found a sleeping place in their tents.</p>
          <p>It was universally admitted that the President was received with
		  enthusiastic respect, which was greatly appreciated. His graceful courtesy,
		  wise words and bearing, indicative of a great man, commanded the admiration of
		  all. Secretary Thompson too “won troops of friends.”</p>
          <p>The correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Standard</hi>attended the
		  ball given Thursday night in honor of the Senior Class, and gives his testimony
		  that it was very splendid. He indulged in a gorgeous metaphor, making it
		  superior to the noon-day sun. The teacher of dancing, Mr. Frensley, had
		  tastefully decorated the rooms and artistically marked out the floor for five
		  sets of quadrilles.</p>
          <p>The President was unable to attend the ball, alleging weariness, but
		  some wondered if his Presbyterian principles inclined him to stay away. The
		  correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">New York Herald</hi>gave it very
		  brilliant praise. He wrote, “to the extent of the number that composed
		  it, I might say that so grand a display of fashion and beauty I never beheld.
		  The costly array of dress and glittering trinkets there exhibited vastly
		  surpassed <pb xml:id="p706" n="706"/>any idea which I had hitherto conceived of the
		  taste of the people of North Carolina.” At 12 o'clock there was a
		  magnificent supper, after which dancing was kept up until a late, or rather an
		  early, hour.</p>
          <p>The correspondent gave favorable reports of all he heard and saw
		  except that there were no facilities provided for the representatives of the
		  press, not only no transportation to and from the railroad, no accommodations
		  for eating and sleeping, but no reserved seats or tables. He charitably
		  forgives these shortcomings because the committees were too much absorbed by
		  attentions to their distinguished guest. The press did the occasion full honor.
		  There were reporters not only from New York, but Columbia, S. C., Richmond,
		  Va., Petersburg, Va., as well as many North Carolina towns. There was entire
		  unanimity of praise, except that an admirer of Colonel MacRae complained that
		  the schedule was not changed to allow the President to hear his address.</p>
          <p>Of the bright youths who matriculated in 1859, twenty-six lost their
		  lives in the great war: Archibald H. Arrington, Private; W. Lewis Battle,
		  Lieutenant; Elias Bunn, Lieutenant; Edward J. Chilton, Private; Leonard A.
		  Henderson, Captain; John M. Kelly, Major; Neill R. Kelly, Lieutenant; Nathaniel
		  A. Ogilby, Private; George M. Quarles, Private; Felix Tankersly, Lieutenant;
		  William B. Whitfield, Private; William L. Yager, Private; Leonard W. Bartlett,
		  Captain; Edward F. Bass, Corporal; James D. Blanchard, Private; John
		  Garlington, Private; Wm. M. Gunnels, Lieutenant; J. J. D. Hodges, Private;
		  Thomas P. Hodges, Captain; Benjamin R. Holt, Lieutenant; Lewis Maverick, Major;
		  Richard A. Morrow, Private; Walter H. Montague; Alfred G. Thompson, Private;
		  James N. Ware, Private; William H. Ware, Private.</p>
          <p>It was during this year that the Trustees made a disastrous mistake in
		  financial policy. The University, as heretofore stated, owned 1,000 shares
		  ($100,000) in the Bank of the State of North Carolina. When the charter
		  of the bank expired the Trustees subscribed, and paid for with the proceeds, a
		  like number of shares in the new Bank of North Carolina. The General Assembly
		  authorized the University to subscribe for another thousand shares. These could
		  not be paid for at <pb xml:id="p707" n="707"/>once, but it was thought by some that
		  the debt necessary to be incurred could be liquidated partly out of money
		  loaned individuals, and the residue from savings out of annual receipts. By a
		  bare majority the subscription was made. Only $10,000 was ever paid on
		  the principal of the debt, and at the end of the war the $90,000 debt
		  remained, and the 2,000 shares were worthless. The result will be in my second
		  volume explained. Those who voted for this disastrous measure were Daniel M.
		  Barringer, John H. Bryan, William W. Holden, Bartholomew F. Moore and David L.
		  Swain; those in the negative Thomas Bragg, Daniel W. Courts, Charles L. Hinton
		  and Charles Manly. Governor Ellis, who presided, by voting with the negative,
		  might have killed the proposition. It is noticeable that the two men who had
		  the widest reputation for financial prudence were with the majority, namely,
		  Messrs. Moore and Swain. Certainly, however, they must not be criticized for
		  not having known in 1859, a year before Lincoln was elected, that the great
		  Civil War would begin two years afterwards. It shows the absorbing nature of
		  the struggle that after the clash of arms was heard, it did not occur to the
		  very able Trustees that it was best to sell the second thousand shares and pay
		  the debt. Some say that this step would have made the University unpopular as
		  implying a distrust of the success of the Confederacy, that such was the hot
		  feeling, that distrust expressed by a word or act was regarded as akin to
		  treason. Still it seems reasonable that a sale could have been effected so
		  privately as not to arouse the suspicions of the fire-eating element. Probably
		  the unbalancing general excitement caused this question of policy to be
		  overlooked.</p>
          <p>The changes of the Faculty in 1860 were: Andrew D. Hepburn, Professor
		  of Metaphysics, Logic and Rhetoric, in place of John T. Wheat, resigned; E.
		  Graham Morrow, Tutor of Mathematics, in place of John W. Graham, transferred to
		  Latin; Frederick A. Fetter, Tutor of the Latin Language, vice Wm. C. Dowd,
		  resigned.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1860 there was a ripple of excitement on
		  account of the Senior Class having invited the Roman Catholic Archbishop Hughes
		  to deliver the Baccalaureate sermon, and his having accepted the invitation.
		  Extreme Protestants, <pb xml:id="p708" n="708"/>especially those who disliked the
		  University, were offended, and freely criticised the appointment. One newspaper
		  apologetically explained that no one was responsible but a few of the members
		  of the Senior Class; that so many were absent at the election that only a
		  majority of a bare quorum extended the call. However this may be, neither the
		  Class nor the University was injured by the selection. The Archbishop conducted
		  himself with singular tact, and preached a sermon of rare excellence. He stood
		  without table or desk before him, and spoke without notes for an hour and three
		  quarters. There was nothing peculiar to Romanism in sermon or services.
		  “The young lady whose protestantism kept her from the sermon, and piety
		  did not keep her from the ball,” was in no danger of perversion, nor was
		  any student or Faculty man, nor any of the audience in danger.</p>
          <p>The Archbishop was attended by Bishop Lynch and Father McNeery. He
		  introduced no gorgeous ceremonies. He wore his cassock, a doctor's hood, a
		  massive gold cross and a diamond ring, said to have been given him by the Pope,
		  and to have the value of $150,000, which might probably be called a
		  Protestant exaggeration. The band played a piece of sacred music. Bishop Lynch
		  read a collect. The Archbishop preached his sermon. Bishop Lynch then read
		  another collect, which was followed by more sacred music from the band, and
		  then the Archbishop, with Bishop Lynch and Father McNeery, retired.</p>
          <p>The words of the preacher were singularly wise, and won the admiration
		  of all, even those most opposed to his ecclesiastical tenets. They were on Love
		  to God because of his infinite power and goodness, and Love to Man as His
		  creature and formed in His image. He enforced this theme with cogent reasoning
		  and striking metaphors. Before closing, he advised against reading works by
		  infidels, because they know not the God of the Scriptures, and therefore their
		  writings prevent the soul from loving God as He has revealed Himself. Loving
		  not God, one cannot love his neighbors aright. The discourse teemed with noble
		  and holy thoughts, and held the attention of the audience throughout.</p>
          <p>It is handed down that the Archbishop consulted the proper authority
		  on the propriety of his choosing for his sermon an <pb xml:id="p709" n="709"/>
		  exposition of the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, but was advised
		  against this, as likely to be offensive to many of the congregation. It was
		  inevitable that there should be supersensitiveness on both sides, Protestant
		  and Roman Catholic. A correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Hillsboro
		  Recorder,</hi>supposed to be Judge Manly, in acrid words, charged discourtesy.
		  He said the whole affair, the reception and treatment of Archbishop Hughes at
		  the University, was a stain upon the President and the Faculty, and a blot upon
		  the fair fame of the State. This was strongly denied, and it was shown that
		  more courtesy had been shown him than had been accorded to other Baccalaureate
		  preachers. He was entertained in excellent style by Rev. Dr. Hubbard.</p>
          <p>The Freshmen declaimers were, Julius C. Mitchell, of Alabama; Richard
		  H. Smith, of Scotland Neck; Wesley Lewis Battle, of Chapel Hill; William H.
		  Reeves, of Tennessee; G. Lawrence Washington, of Kinston; Marandy R. Willeford,
		  of Texas; John T. Harris, of Franklin County; Robert D. Graham, of Hillsboro;
		  William J. White, Warrenton; John H. McGilvary, Fayetteville; Norman L. Shaw,
		  Harrellsville.</p>
          <p>The newspaper critic pronounced the speaking the best from Freshmen
		  for years. Willeford and Harris seemed to be the favorites with the
		  audience.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore competitors on Wednesday night were: William W. Jones,
		  Henderson; Aurelius C. Jones, Texas; John H. Bass, Georgia; William Biggs,
		  Williamston; S. Jay Andrews, Greensboro; John W. Hinsdale, Fayetteville; Henry
		  C. Wall, Richmond County; Reuell A. Stancill, Mississippi; James H. Polk,
		  Tennessee; Thomas G. Skinner, Perquimans County; Thomas W. Taylor, Granville
		  County; William M. Fetter, Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>The exhibition was not considered equal to that of the Freshmen Class.
		  A. C. Jones, Andrews, Wall and Fetter were especially noticed by the
		  correspondent.</p>
          <p>The Annual Address before the Literary Societies was by John Pool,
		  Esq., of the Class of 1847, of the Philanthropic Society, then candidate for
		  Governor on the nomination of the Constitutional-Union Party, which was the
		  heir of the old Whig party. He was after the war a Republican United States
		  Senator. His discourse was an able and earnest effort to inculcate
		  <pb xml:id="p710" n="710"/>the duty of patient study and diligent reading of the
		  best authors, as essential to correct thinking and success in this world's
		  pursuits.</p>
          <p>The following programme shows the themes of the Graduating Class. It
		  seems strange that not one shows that the speaker's brain was filled with
		  Secession and War:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, Iowa M. Royster, Raleigh.</p>
          <p>“Where Eloquence Flourishes Liberty Must Dwell,” Junius C.
		  Battle, Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>“Moral Courage,” James Kelly, Moore County.</p>
          <p>“Man Worship,” Erasmus Decatur Scales, Rockingham
		  County.</p>
          <p>“The Origin of Love—a Poem,” Samuel P. Weir,
		  Greensboro.</p>
          <p>“Literary Vanity,” Wm. John King, Louisburg.</p>
          <p>“The Sentiment of Honor,” Wm. Joseph Headen, Chatham
		  County.</p>
          <p>“Emulation—Its Office in the Work of Education,”
		  Thomas W. Cooper, Bertie County.</p>
          <p>“The Alleged Democracy of the Age,” George P. Bryan,
		  Raleigh.</p>
          <p>“The Social Duties of Man,” Wm. M. Brooks, Chatham
		  County.</p>
          <p>“The Study of Men,” Hugh Strong, South Carolina.</p>
          <p>“Common Sense,” Lewis Bond, Tennessee.</p>
          <p>“Extemporaneous Speaking,” Charles C. Pool, Elizabeth
		  City.</p>
          <p>“Industry and Civilization,” George L. Wilson,
		  Newbern.</p>
          <p>“Influence of Speculative Minds,” Wm. A. Wooster,
		  Wilmington.</p>
          <p>The Valedictory, Edward J. Hale, Fayetteville.</p>
          <p>Those especially noticed by the critic were: Royster, who spoke Latin
		  so clearly and with such propriety of emphasis that people thought they
		  understood his meaning; Hale, who won applause by the metaphor with which he
		  began, that he and his classmates were like a river flowing in its banks before
		  the waters spread abroad over the wide ocean before them, and was listened to
		  admiringly throughout. All the others secured the attention of a crowded
		  house.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p711" n="711"/>
          <p>The report of the Faculty was then read, showing the best scholars of
		  the graduates, Junius C. Battle, George P. Bryan, Edward J. Hale, Charles C.
		  Pool, Iowa M. Royster, Hugh Strong, George L. Wilson and William A.
		  Wooster.</p>
          <p>The second honor men were: Lewis Bond, William M. Brooks, Thomas W.
		  Cooper, William J. Headen, James Kelly, William J. King, Erasmus D. Scales, and
		  Samuel P. Weir.</p>
          <p>In the third rank were William W. Baird, William H. Borden, Charles
		  Bruce, Samuel V. Daniel, John D. Fain, James A. Fogle, James A. Graham, Edward
		  J. Hardin, Eugene S. Martin, Tims Rial, John H. Thorp.</p>
          <p>Two members of the class were reported as never having been absent
		  from any of the 4,500 duties during their four years course, Junius C. Battle
		  and James Kelly. One of the Trustees in attendance, Hon. John H. Bryan, was
		  present at the graduation of the seventh of his sons, four of whom were among
		  the best scholars of their respective classes, and one the best of all.</p>
          <p>There were eighty Bachelor of Arts, and five who obtained the degree
		  of Bachelor of Science (B.S.), viz.: J. L. Douglas, R. L. Heiley, J. A.
		  Prudhomme, G. C. Smith, and S. K. Watkins. Messrs. Alexander Kirkland and
		  Sidney Smith, who were providentially prevented from graduating with their
		  class last year, were now allowed to take their degrees.</p>
          <p>Of the first honor graduates, Battle was a teacher, a corporal, and
		  was mortally wounded at South Mountain, 1862; Bryan was a Tutor in University
		  of North Carolina, destined for the ministry, Captain, killed at Charles City
		  Road, 1864; Hale was a Major, Consul at Manchester, and is an editor; Pool was
		  a member of the Convention of 1868 and Judge of the Superior Court; Royster was
		  a Tutor of University of North Carolina, a Lieutenant, mortally wounded at
		  Gettysburg; Strong was a Confederate soldier, a Presbyterian minister and
		  Principal of a Female School in Walhalla, S. C.; Wilson was a Confederate
		  soldier, and died early; Wooster was Captain, killed in battle. It thus appears
		  that four of the first honor men were killed.</p>
          <p>Of those of the second rank Bond was a Captain, a lawyer, and Speaker
		  of the Tennessee House of Representatives.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p712" n="712"/>
          <p>Of those who obtained no honors, Sydenham B. Alexander has been often
		  Senator from Meckenburg, President of the Farmers' Alliance, Captain, and
		  Representative in Congress.</p>
          <p>Of those matriculating, but not graduating, William Alexander Graham
		  was Assistant Adjutant-General, a manufacturer, State Senator, and is author of
		  Life of General Joseph Graham; Robert N. Ogden was a Lieutenant-Colonel and
		  Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives.</p>
          <p>The following is the list of “Confederate Dead,”
		  matriculates of 1860: Joseph H. Adams, Sergeant; Edward R. Atkinson, Private;
		  Seaborn W. Chisholm, Private; George M. Clark, Major; Joseph B. Coggin,
		  Lieutenant; Virginius Copeland, Lieutenant; Reuben R. DeJarnette, Private;
		  Richard M. Footman, Private; William P. Gill, Lieutenant; DeWitt Clinton Buck,
		  Jr., Private; Montraville D. Clegg, Lieutenant; William T. Hargrove, Adolph
		  Lastrapes, Private; Joseph A. McDermott, Captain; Samuel Wiley Gray, Captain;
		  John H. Green, Sergeant; Neverson C. Maner, Private; Clarence D. Martin,
		  Sergeant; William R. McKethan, Private; William H. H. Mills, Private; Edward A.
		  T. Nicholson, Captain; Jesse H. Person, Lieutenant; Seth B. Speight, Private;
		  Charles Vines, Jr., Lieutenant; Randolph Mitchell, Private; Wm. J. Rhodes,
		  Private.</p>
          <p>This was the last recorded meeting of the Alumni Association for
		  twelve years. It was presided over by the First Vice-President in Gerrard Hall.
		  Fifteen were ascertained to be present, who marched to the Library to hold
		  their business meeting. The Executive Committee reported that they had not
		  succeeded in procuring an orator, and that there was no regular business on
		  hand. A proposition was made that the members of the Senior Class about to
		  graduate might be eligible to membership. After much earnest discussion it was
		  tabled. A small balance due the Treasurer was contributed by the members
		  present. The following officers for the ensuing year were chosen:</p>
          <p>Bartholomew F. Moore (1820), President.</p>
          <p>The Vice-Presidents were: Richard H. Smith (1832), George F. Davidson
		  (1823), John Pool (1847), Ralph H. Graves (1836), James H. Horner (1844),
		  Thomas B. Hill (1832). Davidson was afterwards our “oldest
		  graduate.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p713" n="713"/>
          <p>The Executive Committee were: William H. Battle (1818), Samuel P.
		  Phillips (1841), Richard J. Ashe (1842).</p>
          <p>The Treasurer was Solomon Pool (1853).</p>
          <p>The Secretary was Charles Phillips (1841).</p>
          <p>The Association adjourned to meet at the Commencement of 1861, but
		  “Ate had cried havoc and let slip the dogs of War.” None showed
		  greater alacrity in volunteering for the war or submitting to greater
		  sacrifices or behaved with more gallantry than the Faculty and Alumni of the
		  University.</p>
          <p>It was during this year that the Executive Committee recorded their
		  opinion of hazing in the following resolution: “The ridicule and petty
		  annoyances practiced by certain students upon new members of the College, who
		  upon their first admission need sympathy and kindness of their fellows, is a
		  cruel and contemptible practice, wholly below the dignity and gentle bearing of
		  the students of our University, and ought to be put down peremptorily by the
		  Faculty.”</p>
          <p>This was the last Commencement which was not marred by the groundswell
		  of the coming war. Hereafter the vacancies in the ranks of the several classes
		  will be typical of the vacancies in regiments swept by shell and ball.</p>
          <p>The Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church took action in the
		  matter of attendance on Sunday services. At the Convention held in Charlotte in
		  May, 1860, Rev. Edwin M. Forbes and Richard S. Mason, on the part of the
		  clergy, and Messrs. Josiah Collins, T. George Walton and A. J. DeRossett, of
		  the laity, reported a memorial, which was unanimously approved and forwarded to
		  the Board of Trustees. The substance is that the law of the University
		  requiring students, not communicants, to attend religious service in the
		  Chapel, even although parents and guardians request permission to attend
		  service in some other church, is now injurious and wrong: 1st, it interferes
		  with the conscience, because the student is deprived of the worship to which
		  the parent and perhaps the student is conscientiously attached; 2nd, it is
		  against the Constitution of North Carolina and of the United States,
		  guarantying the right to worship God according to the dictates of their own
		  consciences. The Convention disclaimed any censure of the Trustees for having
		  passed the law, when the <pb xml:id="p714" n="714"/>Chapel services were all, or
		  nearly all, that were accessible, but that condition no longer exists. They
		  asked nothing especially for the Episcopal Church, but that the same privileges
		  should be extended to all, namely, that a student of full age can attend the
		  services in which he has been educated, and if under age, wherever requested by
		  his parent or guardian.</p>
          <p>The memorial, which was very respectful in tone, together with an
		  ordinance offered by John H. Bryan, were laid on the table at the June meeting
		  to be taken up at the next annual meeting in December.</p>
          <p>At that meeting, at the instance of Judge W. H. Battle, the subject
		  was considered, and, after much discussion, on the motion of Judge R. M.
		  Saunders, referred to Judge M. E. Manly, Judge Battle and P. H. Winston (of
		  Anson) to report such a scheme of ordinances and regulations as were indicated
		  as the sense of the present meeting.</p>
          <p>On December 18th, 1860, Judge Manly reported in substance the
		  following scheme, which was adopted. The preamble expresses the desire of the
		  Board to free the institution from just charges of putting constraint on the
		  conscience of any student.</p>
          <p>The President may grant a dispensation from attending any public
		  worship on the Lord's or other day,</p>
          <p>1. Where the parent or guardian resides in Chapel Hill and desires his
		  son or ward to worship with his family;</p>
          <p>2. Where the student is a communicant with some denomination having
		  worship in the village different from that of the officiating Chaplain;</p>
          <p>3. When a student is a member of a religious denomination or Church,
		  and declares in writing that he has scruples against attending Chapel
		  worship;</p>
          <p>4. Where the parent or guardian declares in writing that he has
		  scruples of conscience against his son or ward attending Chapel worship, and
		  indicates what denomination he prefers him to unite with.</p>
          <p>The attendance on Chapel worship elsewhere is compulsory, but if the
		  student has scruples against attending anywhere he must remain in his room in a
		  quiet and orderly manner.</p>
          <p>The Faculty were authorized to enforce the ordinances.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p715" n="715"/>
          <p>The President could give occasional permission to attend elsewhere
		  than in the Chapel for any reason satisfactory to himself.</p>
          <p>The Board declared its conviction that a seasonable, reverential and
		  habitual attendance on prayers and public worship is an important aid to
		  intellectual and moral training of youth, and in the maintenance of order, and
		  therefore ordain that all students not exempted shall attend public worship on
		  the Lord's Day. All without exception shall attend morning and evening prayers,
		  except those temporarily excused by the President, or permanently excused by a
		  vote of the Board of Trustees.</p>
          <p>It will be noticed that the regulations providing for the cases of
		  such as objected to attending any Protestant worship, was doubtless suggested
		  by Judge Manly, who was a Roman Catholic. Jews were cared for by the same
		  provision. The Faculty were puzzled in regard to ascertaining absences from
		  services in the village. The plan of asking students on Monday morning whether
		  they had been “to Church” the day before was adopted. Tradition
		  says that some, who answered in the affirmative, did not deem it their duty to
		  report the length of their stay. The regulations thus adopted continued in
		  force until the doors were closed in 1868. The agitation and settlement are
		  analagous to the long continued struggle between the Church of England and the
		  Non-Conformists over the religious services in English schools.</p>
          <p>President Swain, as might have been expected of his kindliness of
		  heart, was quite liberal in allowing attendance on the village churches for
		  special reasons. For example, all the students had permission to absent
		  themselves from the Chapel in order to hear a sermon preached by Bishop
		  Atkinson in the Episcopal Church.</p>
          <p>The Faculty sought loyally to carry out the instructions of the
		  Trustees. To ensure orderly deportment the students attending Chapel were
		  required to sit in classes, the pews assigned to each class being changed
		  whenever the increase in numbers required. The postures agreed on at first was
		  sitting when the Bible was being read and sermon preached, standing at prayers
		  and singing. In 1856 the postures customary in the Church to which the
		  officiating minister belonged were <pb xml:id="p716" n="716"/>ordered to be
		  observed, with the exception that sitting and leaning forward should be
		  substituted for kneeling, because the arrangement of the seats made kneeling
		  difficult.</p>
          <p>After the adoption of this ordinance there were numerous summonings
		  before the Faculty for breaches thereof, the most numerous being for changing
		  seats, contrary to rule.</p>
          <p>The Sunday services in Gerrard Hall were not popular, although after
		  about 1855 there was a student choir, whose members had the sole right to sit
		  in the gallery. I find four students, whose religious fervor could not be
		  detected in daily life, petitioning to be absent from the Chapel in order to
		  join the choir of the Episcopal Church. They were refused.</p>
          <p>To ensure proper inspection of the attitudes of the worshippers, the
		  President and three preachers, Professors Mitchell, Phillips and Wheat,
		  occupied the rostrum; Professors Kimberly and C. Phillips, assisted by Tutors
		  Pool, Lucas, Spruill and Coleman, were seated in the center of the building
		  between the Seniors and Sophomores and between the Juniors and Freshmen, and
		  Professors Fetter, Hubbard and Shipp, assisted by Tutors R. H. Battle and
		  Jackson, were stationed in the rear behind the Seniors and Juniors.</p>
          <p>With all this “cloud of witnesses encompassing them
		  around,” with thirty vigilant eyes flashing on every movement, it was
		  thought that propriety of demeanor was secured, however much at the expense of
		  religious fervor of students and of the professorial detective force. The
		  frequent summonings before the Faculty for breaches of the rules show that the
		  watchers were vigilant, the bad behavior detected but not prevented.</p>
          <p>As late as February, 1868, the Faculty voted, eleven to one, that all
		  religious denominations should be represented in the clerical services of the
		  Chapel on the Sabbath; and, secondly, that all students should be required to
		  attend unless excused by the Faculty on conscientious scruples. The Trustees,
		  however, did not change their ordinances on the subject. The action of the
		  Faculty was doubtless in consequence of the paucity of numbers then on the roll
		  of the institution.</p>
          <p>There are not now two opinions on the subject of the effect of
		  compulsory attendance on religious exercises. There were <pb xml:id="p717" n="717"/>
		  no student organizations in the old days analagous to our Young Mens' Christian
		  Association. There were no student classes for the study of the Bible. There
		  was almost no teaching by students in the Sunday Schools of the town and
		  country as we now have. There were few members of the Church. Treating divine
		  worship as a college duty for breach of which the usual punishments were
		  inflicted, had the result of making such worship a college regulation only, to
		  be complied with or avoided as the temperament of the student dictated. This
		  system was in truth pro tanto a union of Church and State, and was attended
		  with the coldheartedness and formality, evasions and secret hostility, which
		  history shows have been the results of such unions in all ages.</p>
          <p>In September, 1860, the Faculty issued a ringing circular to the
		  public. They declared that they, as well as the Trustees, were more anxious to
		  elevate the standard of scholarship and morals than to gather numbers. They
		  were therefore gradually increasing the rigor of examinations for admission and
		  for advancement from class to class. They asked the co-operation of parents and
		  guardians.</p>
          <p>It was stated that half of the States and over thirty colleges, North
		  and South, were represented in the student body. This University favorably
		  compares with those of other institutions, and at no period in its history did
		  we have a superior Faculty, or were the students more eager to avail themselves
		  of the educational advantages offered.</p>
          <p>Parents and guardians were earnestly requested to be chary of granting
		  permission to students to be absent from the institution. Permission extended
		  to one produces a desire to his associates to accompany him. “The
		  contagion spreads rapidly, and the concurrence of a concert, a circus, a
		  political meeting, or the State Fair, begets a spirit of restlessness for days
		  before and afterwards, altogether unfavorable to the quiet and diligent
		  performance of duty.” The loss of time and money is considerable, and
		  other serious evils occur. The rule of the Faculty requires that no one shall
		  be allowed to attend the State Fair unless the parent or guardian asks for it
		  and himself is to be present.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p718" n="718"/>
          <p>During the year the belfry on the South Building was built according
		  to the plans and supervision of Thomas H. Coates, architect. Since the
		  reopening of the institution in 1875, it has been strengthened and bears well
		  the daily and nightly clanging of the melodious bell. When it was the fashion
		  to pursue unlawful and nocturnal ringers, there was wild scampering when
		  warning was given that professors were ascending the stairs. Some slid down a
		  rope through a trap door previously cut, others hid in perilous places on the
		  roof, and one more daring, David Vance, climbed down the lightning rod. Few
		  were ever caught. The bell-rope then reached down no further than the attic,
		  now it descends through a tube to the first floor. Any one can pull it who
		  wishes, but it is seldom interfered with without authority.</p>
          <p>The number of students in the Fall of 1860 was 376, a falling off of
		  54 from the preceding year. There were from North Carolina 221, a falling off
		  of 24. Of those from other States, Mississippi sent 26, Tennessee 26, Louisiana
		  22, Alabama 19, Georgia 17, South Carolina 15, Texas 10, Florida 5, Virginia 4,
		  Arkansas 3, Missouri and New Mexico 2 each, California, Iowa, Kentucky and Ohio
		  1 each, a total of 155 as against 185 the previous year, a falling off of
		  30.</p>
          <p>Rev. Dr. Albert M. Shipp left the University in this year. He was
		  afterwards much honored by his Church. He was President of Greensboro Female
		  College, President of Wofford College in South Carolina, and Dean of the
		  Theological Department of Vanderbilt University. This last position he resigned
		  because of differences with Bishop McTyeire, and published a pamphlet giving
		  his side of the question. He was a preacher of power and eloquence, but was
		  hindered from greatest success by throat disease.</p>
          <p>Rev. Dr. Wheat also resigned his chair of Rhetoric and Logic and
		  became Rector of Christ Church, Little Rock, Arkansas. Having two sons in the
		  Confederate army, Robateau, Colonel of the Louisiana Tigers, killed at Gaines'
		  Mill, and John Thomas, killed at Shiloh, his sympathies were so strong that he
		  accepted a Chaplaincy in the army, and held it during 1862. He then continued
		  in charge of a church in Little Rock until 1867, when he became Rector of the
		  Monumental Church <pb xml:id="p719" n="719"/>in Memphis, resigning in 1873. At the
		  farewell service the preacher, Rev. Dr. Carmichael, feelingly stated that his
		  leaving the bar and entering the ministry was caused by an eloquent sermon of
		  Dr. Wheat's.</p>
          <p>Dr. Wheat had the high honor of being six times a Delegate to the
		  General Convention. He received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the
		  University of Nashville, Tennessee. He was author of a book entitled,
		  “Preparation for the Holy Communion.” He and his wife Selina Blair
		  (Patten) Wheat in 1875 celebrated their Golden Wedding, on which occasion he
		  wrote a poem on his pre-nuptial life, describing scenes in his natal Washington
		  City. In the next year and afterwards he planted churches in Berkeley,
		  California, in Lewisburg, West Virginia, and Concord, North Carolina. After
		  <choice><sic>nealy</sic><corr>nearly</corr></choice>sixty years of labor as a minister, he died
		  February 2nd, 1886, in his 86th year.</p>
          <p>In 1861 George P. Bryan was Tutor of Latin, in place of John W.
		  Graham, resigned; George B. Johnston, Tutor of Greek, vice Samuel S. Jackson,
		  resigned, and Iowa M. Royster, Tutor of Rhetoric and Elocution. Solomon Pool
		  was raised from a Tutorship to being Adjunct Professor of Pure Mathematics.
		  Morrow resigned his Tutorship. Rev. Albert M. Shipp resigned the professorship
		  of History, and the vacancy was not filled.</p>
          <p>The State authorities found that the increased business required by
		  the war made it necessary to make available all the space in the Capitol. They
		  therefore donated to the University the collections, made by State Geologist
		  Ebenezer Emmons, of rocks and minerals stored in one of its rooms. Probably the
		  most valuable part of the collection was disposed of by his son to Williams
		  College for $6,000, including the famous fossil, dromotherium, the
		  earliest mammal in the primeval world. Professor Martin spent two weeks in
		  classifying the specimens and superintending the shipments to Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>As each State passed an ordinance of Secession, its citizens at the
		  University hurried home fired with zeal to take up arms, never doubting that
		  their cause was just. Of those who remained until the firing on Fort Sumter,
		  all were in a ferment. On April 27th the Juniors, Sophomores and Freshmen
		  petitioned <pb xml:id="p720" n="720"/>the Trustees for a total suspension of
		  exercises until the Fall term. They stated that the Seniors did not sign the
		  petition because they intended not to return to Commencement at the end of
		  their Senior vacation to receive their diplomas in person. It was urged that it
		  was impossible on account of excitement to attend to duty. If the Trustees
		  should object that the war would end in two or three months, the reply was that
		  nothing would be lost, because the students could not study at present, and
		  they would return strengthened in body for more arduous labor; but if
		  hostilities should longer continue, and if they should remain at the
		  University, they would leap at once from ease and inactivity into the hardships
		  of war.</p>
          <p>Moreover they had ascertained that at the end of the term there would
		  be only about seventy-five students in all the classes. Eight or ten were
		  leaving every day, and very many were waiting for remittances from home to
		  enable them to do likewise. They sincerely hoped that the Trustees “will
		  see the necessity of every arm being wielded in the coming contest and every
		  son's participating in defense of our homes and firesides.” The petition
		  met with no success.</p>
          <p>The Committee were H. H. Price, of New Orleans; Robert B. Peebles, of
		  Northampton County, and Willoughby F. Avery, of Morganton. All in due time
		  entered the army.</p>
          <p>So far from granting the petition, President Swain promptly issued a
		  circular especially to the patrons of the institution. It began by conceding
		  that the affairs of our country called for our best services, in the tented
		  field, if necessary. The Faculty have no wish to quench patriotic ardor, or to
		  withhold from service, at the proper time, any one capable of performing the
		  duties of a soldier, but beg leave to intimate the propriety of restraining the
		  young and inexperienced from rushing prematurely into the army.</p>
          <p>Many young men, he said, had left with the consent of parents and
		  Faculty; others without permission, who, it is hoped, will return and stand the
		  May examinations.</p>
          <p>It was emphatically announced that the University exercises would go
		  on as heretofore. No reasonable pains would be spared to render the approaching
		  Commencement successful. The Seniors, except where specially exempted, are
		  expected to be in attendance.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p721" n="721"/>
          <p>Notwithstanding these brave words, over the Commencement of 1861 there
		  was a general gloom. Large numbers of the students, Seniors, Juniors,
		  Sophomores, Freshmen, had enlisted in the army, and most of those remaining
		  were preparing to go. Some of the Faculty were getting ready to follow. General
		  Thomas L. Clingman had agreed to deliver the address before the two Societies,
		  but was detained by unavoidable military duty. There were no Historical or
		  Alumni addresses. But President Swain had determined that the exercises of the
		  University should not be suspended by war or preparations for war.</p>
          <p>The preacher of the sermon to the Graduating Class was one of the most
		  eminent Southern divines, Rev. Dr. John A. Broadus, of the Southern Baptist
		  Theological Seminary at Louisville. His text was: “Have any of the Rulers
		  of the Pharisees believed on Him.” The object was to account for the fact
		  that so many great men in Science and Philosophy deny the Christ. The chief
		  reason was to be found in the self-denial required in the true disciple of
		  Christ. The predominance of Faith by which a Christian walks, over sight, by
		  which Rulers and Pharisees walk, was most clearly and attractively set forth as
		  the truest adornment of the manly character, a strong support in the trials of
		  life and the best preparation for the Future.</p>
          <p>Professor Charles Phillips, who furnished this abstract to the press,
		  praised most highly the manner of delivery as well as the excellence of the
		  sermon.</p>
          <p>Dr. Broadus occupied Wednesday morning. At night the Sophomore
		  Declaimers came on. They were John T. Harris, of Franklin County; Olin Welborn,
		  of Georgia; Robert B. Peebles, of Northampton; Joseph A. McDermot, Tennessee;
		  G. Lawrence Washington, of Kinston; Gabriel Johnston, of Edenton. The speaking
		  of Harris was particularly praised. There were no Freshmen Declaimers. Of the
		  Sophomores, Wellborn rose to be a Colonel C. S. A., a Representative in
		  Congress from Texas, and United States District Judge in California; Peebles
		  and Johnston are mentioned hereafter; McDermott was a Captain C. S. A., and was
		  killed at Vicksburg. <pb xml:id="p722" n="722"/>Not one of these Declaimers
		  continued his course to the close of his Senior year.</p>
          <p>On Thursday the Seniors delivered their original speeches. Those
		  were:</p>
          <p>“The Greek Oration—the Ancient Greek,” Cornelius
		  Furman Dowd, Wake County.</p>
          <p>“The Study of Man,” Nicholas L. Williams, Yadkin
		  County.</p>
          <p>“Agriculture,” Guilford Nicholson, Halifax County.</p>
          <p>“The Festal Hour,” N. Partee Foard, Concord.</p>
          <p>“Knowledge of Character, a Prerequisite to the Enlightenment of
		  Society,” Rufus L. Coffin, Mississippi.</p>
          <p>“The Study of Geology,” Thomas B. Davidson, Louisiana.</p>
          <p>“The Neglect of Moral Science,” John W. Halliburton,
		  Mississippi.</p>
          <p>“The Golden Mean,” Robert T. Murphy, Sampson County.</p>
          <p>“The Political Reformer,” William Van Wyck, South
		  Carolina.</p>
          <p>“Thomas Paine,” James M. Hobson, Davie County.</p>
          <p>“Spanish Oration, <foreign xml:lang="spa">Castellano el Hermoso
		  Language</foreign>,” James Turner Morehead, Greensboro.</p>
          <p>The Valedictory, Thomas T. Allen, Windsor.</p>
          <p>It will be noticed that the Latin Salutatory, which had been on the
		  programme for many years, was omitted. The Salutatorian, Charles M. Stedman,
		  was with his regiment at Yorktown. There is a striking absence of allusions to
		  the war in those speeches.</p>
          <p>In the fervor of patriotism the Faculty agreed, with the consent of
		  the Trustees gladly given, to grant diplomas to all members of the Senior
		  Class, although many had joined the army and did not stand their examinations.
		  Only thirty out of the eighty-seven were present in person. Azariah Coburn
		  Stewart, who was one of the best scholars of the class until the Senior year,
		  then a member of the State Convention, was also allowed a degree.</p>
          <p>The first distinction was assigned to Thomas T. Allen, Robert S.
		  Clark, J. Turner Morehead, Robert T. Murphy, David W. Simmons, Jr., Charles M.
		  Stedman, E. Eldridge Wright.</p>
          <p>The second to James E. Butts, C. Furman Dowd, James M. Hobson, James
		  S. Knight, Lewis Maverick, William Van Wyck.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p723" n="723"/>
          <p>The third to R. Lawrence Coffin, John D. Currie, Weldon E. Davis, John
		  H. Dobbin, Franklin Garrett, John W. Halliburton, Thomas Haughton, John F.
		  Lightfoot, James Marshall, Guilford Nicholson, James P. Parker, Oliver T.
		  Parks, Jesse G. Ross.</p>
          <p>Of the best scholars Allen was a lawyer and died early; Clark, not
		  traced; Morehead was Adjutant of a Cavalry Regiment, State Senator, member of
		  Convention of 1865, Banker and Manufacturer; Murphy was a Lieutenant, Clerk and
		  Master in Equity, died early; Simmons was a Lieutenant, killed in battle;
		  Stedman was a Major, a lawyer, Lieutenant-Governor of North Carolina; Wright a
		  Captain, killed at Murfreesboro; Hobson was a Lieutenant, in the Legislature of
		  Alabama, Judge of the County Court.

          <p>(1) Mr. Hobson was the father of Richmond Pearson Hobson,
			 distinguished in the Spanish war.</p>
          <p>Of those not receiving honors, Spier Whitaker was Adjutant, Chairman
		  of the State Democratic Committee, Judge of the Superior Court; Stewart died
		  while a member of the Convention of 1861.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates not graduating with the class, John R. Ely was
		  Adjutant-General; James C. Luttrell, Captain and Mayor of Knoxville; Joseph M.
		  Morehead Lieutenant, Clerk and Master, and President of the Guilford Battle
		  Ground Association.</p>
          <p>The following matriculates lost their lives in the war: Joseph H.
		  Branch, Private; Theophilus H. Holmes, Lieutenant; Robert C. McRee,
		  Sergeant-Major; Napoleon B. Owens, Private; Edward L. Richardson, Private;
		  Nathan J. Snead, Private; Alva C. Hartsfield; Henry C. Miller, Private.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on Abraham Caruthers and
		  Nathan Green, of Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Professor William J. Martin on the 21st of September, 1861, asked for
		  and obtained leave of absence, at first for twelve months, renewed for the war
		  at the end of that time. At first he was Captain of the 28th North Carolina
		  Infantry. He was afterwards promoted to be Lieutenant-Colonel of the 11th.</p>
          <p>July 31, 1861, the Faculty became alarmed at the report widely spread
		  that on account of the war the exercises of <pb xml:id="p724" n="724"/>the
		  University had been suspended. They hastened to issue a circular stating that
		  since 1795 there had been no suspension and would not be in the future. The
		  troubled state of the country and paralysis of all kinds of business very much
		  diminished the number of students. Much satisfaction was expressed that the
		  diminution of numbers contributed much to the public good. Students, who were
		  with them at the opening of the year, were to be found in arms under the banner
		  of every State of the Confederacy, and there was probably no regiment in the
		  service in which there was not one or more of our alumni or students enrolled.
		  We were very fully represented at Bethel, and in fair proportion at Manassas.
		  The instruction now given in Military Tactics renders our present students
		  likely to be as efficient as their elder brethren. This Department will be
		  increased as needed.</p>
          <p>The decrease in numbers it was contended rendered the instruction more
		  efficient. The two new edifices (the New East and the New West) containing
		  forty dormitories, convenient Lecture Rooms, and Society Halls and Libraries,
		  very neatly embellished and nicely furnished, are ready for occupancy. The
		  patronage is not likely to be materially or permanently diminished.</p>
          <p>The Military Tactics mentioned was drilling after Upham's Manual. For
		  some months Professor Martin was the Drill Master. The Tutor Frederick A.
		  Fetter, who had a few months of service in the field, was appointed to this
		  duty March 18, 1862, with the obligation to occupy a room in the South Building
		  and be vigilant in preserving order. The regular studies were to go on as
		  usual.</p>
          <p>Again in November the watchful President found it advisable to assure
		  the Trustees, and through them, the public that he would not close the doors of
		  the institution under his charge. A circular, expressed in the elegant style of
		  Dr. Hubbard, was issued. The Faculty, considering the troubled condition of the
		  country, requested the President to make known to the Trustees their purpose to
		  remain at their posts and divide among them the labor of instruction and aid in
		  whatever way they can the interests of the institution. In order to relieve as
		  far as they could the cares of the Trustees <pb xml:id="p725" n="725"/>touching
		  pecuniary affairs, they expressed their willingness to accept such compensation
		  for their services as the Trustees might judge best.</p>
          <p>In light of the subsequent progressive decrease in the value of
		  Confederate and State currency, this offer was magnanimous. The Trustees took
		  them at their word. The salary of the President was reduced to $2,000,
		  those of the Professors to $1,500, the Assistant Professor (Pool)
		  $1,100, with $100 additional for clerical duties, of the
		  Librarian (Dr. Hubbard) $100, and the Bursar (Fetter) $500.
		  President Swain, in a letter to the Executive Committee, stated that his salary
		  had been from January 1st, 1836, to July 1st, 1855, $2,000 per annum;
		  from July 1st, 1855, to January 1st, 1858, $2,200, and from January 1st,
		  1858, to January 1st, 1862, $2,500. He suggested a reduction of ten per
		  cent.</p>
          <p>The Trustees were watchful to distribute labors properly among the
		  diminishing corps of instructors. For example, it was graciously enacted that
		  those who preached in the Chapel on Sunday mornings should be excused from
		  teaching the classes in the Bible in the afternoons.</p>
          <p>President Swain was urged to provide that the University should not be
		  behind the prevailing warlike spirit, but should supply the general demand for
		  military education. Nothing was done but some instruction in the manual of arms
		  and company evolutions.</p>
          <p>Various expedients were resorted to to obtain supplies necessary for
		  man and beast. There has been preserved a calculation made in November, 1862,
		  by Dr. Charles Phillips, showing how Mr. Andrew Mickle was sent by thirty heads
		  of families into a neighborhood abounding in corn to make purchases for them.
		  He bought 383 4-15 barrels, equal to 1,921 1-3 bushels, for $1,897.95.
		  The freight on the railroad to Durham was $349.70; on wagons from Durham
		  $327.51. His expenses were $172.35. Adding minor expenses, the
		  cost of the corn at Chapel Hill was $2,460.61, or $6.75 per
		  barrel. It was distributed in varying amounts from two barrels upward,
		  according to demand. John H. Watson, who kept the livery stable, took ninety
		  barrels, President Swain 33, Judge Battle 24, and so on. Cornbread was much
		  used during the scarcity, <pb xml:id="p726" n="726"/>and the thrifty housewives
		  studied the art of making coffee out of parched sweet potatoes, grains of rye
		  and other substitutes.</p>
          <p>At another time, probably two years later, some of the Faculty
		  accepted the offer of a gentleman owning a farm in Wake, over twenty miles from
		  Chapel Hill, to give them gratis all the peas they were willing to gather from
		  the field. This leguminous addition to their bill of fare was highly
		  appreciated.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1862 was naturally more gloomy than that of 1861.
		  There were only five Trustees present, two of whom were from Chapel Hill, the
		  others being ex-Governor Charles Manly, Secretary-Treasurer, of Wake;
		  ex-Governor Graham, and Mr. Paul C. Cameron, the last two of Orange. There was
		  only one father of a graduate, and not one mother, or sister, or cousin. The
		  Graduating Class contained only twenty-four against ninety-nine in 1861, and
		  125 in 1859. There was present only one young lady, not then a resident in
		  Chapel Hill. The audiences, because of the considerable number of
		  “refugees” added to the normal population of the village, were
		  however quite respectable. The number of students, which at the beginning of
		  the term was 320, had shrunk to about 100. Besides Professor Martin,
		  Lieutenant-Colonel, Tutor Johnston was a Captain and a prisoner of war. The
		  other Tutors had enlisted or were about to enlist in the army.</p>
          <p>The Sermon before the Graduating Class was equal in excellence to any
		  of its predecessors. The preacher was the Right Reverend Thomas Atkinson,
		  Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church in North Carolina. The text was,
		  “Come, let us reason together.” He invited all to reason, argue,
		  meditate as to their future course. They should not seek after wealth or fame
		  or pleasure. Heavenly wisdom was pressed as leading to happiness in this world
		  and in the next. He made no gestures, but his enunciation was so clear and
		  forcible, his emphasis so appropriate, his looks so sincere, and his thoughts
		  so elevating, that his words penetrated to the heart. It was impossible not to
		  listen and be affected.</p>
          <p>Hon. Wm. B. Rodman had been invited to deliver the Address before the
		  two Societies, and agreed to do so. He was necessarily prevented, and Rev. Dr.
		  Hubbard, Professor of <pb xml:id="p727" n="727"/>Latin, ably filled his place. He
		  gave an analysis of the motto of the Society he represented, the Philanthropic
		  (Love of Virtue, Liberty and Science), and pressed the pursuit of the virtues
		  indicated as the noblest course for all.</p>
          <p>The Freshmen Declaimers were William C. Prout, of Granville County;
		  James A. Hodge, of Wake; John G. Young, of Charlotte; Joseph H. Branch,
		  Florida; Alvin B. Howard, of Iredell County; Abner H. Askew, Bertie County;
		  William H. Call, Mocksville; William F. Parker, Halifax County.</p>
          <p>The audience seemed to give the preference to Mr. Branch, and next to
		  him Mr. Hodge.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore Declaimers were William A. Guthrie, Chapel Hill; Robert
		  C. McRee, Wilmington; Augustus Van Wyck, of South Carolina; Carney J. Bryan, of
		  Washington, N. C., and John M. Jordan, of Richmond County. Messrs Johnson and
		  Van Wyck were much praised, but Mr. McRee's effort was particularly remarked
		  for excellence. The rain poured in torrents, the lightning flashed, and the
		  thunder terrifically rolled during the exercises of this and the preceding
		  night.</p>
          <p>Of the Freshmen only Prout, Hodge and Askew, and of the Sophomores
		  only Guthrie and Van Wyck, finished their course.</p>
          <p>There were ten speeches of the Seniors:</p>
          <p>The Latin Salutatory, by John A. Cameron, of Harnett County.</p>
          <p>Archibald McFadyen, Cumberland County.</p>
          <p>“The Vicissitudes of Life,” Albert B. Gorrell, of
		  Winston.</p>
          <p>“The Crisis and its Cause,” Archibald A. McMillan, of
		  Robeson County.</p>
          <p>“Departed Greatness,” Thomas S. Armistead, of
		  Plymouth.</p>
          <p>“The Die is Cast,” Boaz W. Young, Wake County.</p>
          <p>“The Influence and Obligations of Professional Men,”
		  William W. Jones, of Henderson.</p>
          <p>“The True Statesman,” Thomas J. Hadley, of Wilson.</p>
          <p>“The Triumphs of Machinery,” John M. McIver, of Moore
		  County.</p>
          <p>“The Vanity of Fame,” John G. Rencher, Santa Fe.</p>
          <p>The Valedictory, James E. Moore, of Martin County.</p>
          <p>The speeches of Messrs. McFayden, Young, Hadley and McIver were
		  generally pronounced the best.</p>
          <p>In the Senior Class the first honor was awarded to Mr.
		  <pb xml:id="p728" n="728"/>Frank M. Leigh, of Columbus, Mississippi, then with the
		  army about Corinth.</p>
          <p>The second distinction was assigned to John A. Cameron, Ovide
		  Dupré, of Louisiana; Edward A. Martin, Chapel Hill; James Edwin Moore
		  and Boaz W. Young.</p>
          <p>The third distinction to Adolphus L. Fitzgerald Rockingham County;
		  Archibald W. McFayden, of Cumberland County, and Archibald A. McMillan, Robeson
		  County.</p>
          <p>Taking the honor men in order, Leigh was a Captain, and is a
		  manufacturer and commission merchant; Cameron a Sergeant and a planter;
		  Dupré a lawyer in New York, Assistant United States District Attorney;
		  Martin a Regimental Adjutant, a teacher, and died early of consumption; Moore
		  was a Lieutenant, a member of the Legislature and a leader of the bar; Young is
		  a teacher, farmer, and Chairman of the Board of Education of Johnston
		  County.</p>
          <p>Fitzgerald is Judge of the Supreme Court of Nevada; McFayden was a
		  Lieutenant and a Presbyterian minister.</p>
          <p>Of those not graduating, Silvester Hassell was Principal of a
		  Collegiate Institute and author of a history of the Primitive Baptist Church.
		  He uniformly won first distinction, but was forced on account of the war to
		  leave the University without graduating.</p>
          <p>Of those matriculating with the class, about six times as many as
		  graduated, a long list may be seen in the Appendix. I note especially Thomas D.
		  Johnson, of Tennessee, Surgeon, Staff Surgeon in the Egyptian army; Dossey
		  Battle, Lieutenant, journalist, Judge of the Criminal Court; Thomas G. Skinner,
		  Confederate soldier, a leader at the bar, Representative in Congress.</p>
          <p>Only four matriculates of the year 1862 were killed in battle: John H.
		  Haughton, Private; Frederick Nash, Private; John W. Lawrence, Private; John R.
		  Mason, Private.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on Right Rev. Thomas
		  Atkinson, Bishop, and Matthias Evans Manly, Judge of the Supreme Court of North
		  Carolina.</p>
          <p>Ball managers were elected as usual. On their behalf R. D. Osborn
		  wrote to the Trustees that it was doubtful if the usual ball could be had
		  unless the Trustees would give $200 or $300.
		  <pb xml:id="p729" n="729"/>“Of course the “Seignors” will feel
		  slighted, as this will be the first time the festival in their honor will be
		  omitted.” The Trustees felt too mournful to respond, and the ball was not
		  held.</p>
          <p>There was trouble about the marshal, who should have been elected by
		  the Seniors out of the Junior Class. Instead of that, the Seniors took offense
		  at a supposed insult by the Juniors, and declined to be escorted into the
		  Chapel by one of that class. They accordingly elected Mr. R. H. Lee, a
		  Sophomore, and asked for his confirmation. The Trustees declined to depart from
		  the rule, so that there were no marshals at this Commencement.</p>
          <p>There was no music. The ladies in Chapel Hill escorted themselves to
		  decorate the Chapel. But the young men went through with their exercises with
		  spirit, while the news was constantly coming in of gallant fighting or deaths
		  or wounding of their late associates at the front. President Swain at the close
		  of the exercises told of the student life of the brave, the accomplished, the
		  admired and loved Pettigrew, the best scholar of the University, grievously
		  wounded at Seven Pines.</p>
          <p>As usual, the grand Doxology was sung by all the audience.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1863 the number of Trustees increased. There
		  were Governor Vance and four ex-Governors, namely, Swain, Morehead, Graham and
		  Manly. There were two Judges of the Supreme Court, Battle and Manly. The other
		  Trustees were Hon. D. M. Barringer, and Messrs. P. C. Cameron, M. L. Wiggins,
		  and K. P. Battle.</p>
          <p>The Sermon before the Graduating Class was preached on Wednesday night
		  by Rev. Dr. W. H. McGuffey, Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy in the
		  University of Virginia. It was from Proverbs, “The preparation of the
		  heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the Lord.” He showed
		  that every creature capable of development requires the preparation of an
		  intelligence superior to itself. This proposition was enforced in a style of
		  “rare lucidness, terseness and power. He had none of the
		  unintelligibility proverbially attributed to teachers of metaphysical
		  subjects.”</p>
          <p>The Declamation on the part of the Freshman Class had seven
		  competitors, Paul B. Means, of Cabarrus; John Burgwyn <pb xml:id="p730" n="730"/>
		  MacRae, of Fayetteville; Julian S. Carr, of Chapel Hill; Frank P. Redmond, of
		  Tarboro; Joseph C. Mickle, of Chapel Hill; George W. Wallace, of Norfolk; Mark
		  D. Stevenson, of Newbern. Messrs. Stevenson, Mickle and Wallace won most praise
		  according to the reporter.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore competitors were Charles J. Austin, Tarboro; Abner H.
		  Askew, of Hertford County; John S. Henderson, of Salisbury; Wm. M. Chalmers, of
		  Halifax County, Va.; John T. Rankin, Wilmington; Henry A. London, Pittsboro;
		  Robert D. Osborne, Charlotte; John R. D. Shepard, Raleigh. All these did well,
		  but Mr. Osborne was thought to be the best.</p>
          <p>At the Commencement of 1866, when these Freshmen Declaimers should
		  have received their diplomas, not one was present, though Means subsequently
		  graduated. Of the Sophomores Austin, Askew, Henderson, London and Shepard were
		  so fortunate as to obtain their degrees in 1865.</p>
          <p>President Swain, as Orator before the Literary Societies, gave a
		  series of Geographical and Historical parallels between North Carolina and the
		  world at large, and then with Great Britain and other countries. Col. John H.
		  Wheeler followed with an Address before the Historical Society, showing scenes
		  in North Carolina History well calculated to inspire the pen of the poet and
		  pencil of the artist.</p>
          <p>The Marshals, William R. Kenan, and his assistants, William A.
		  Guthrie, James T. Tate, Augustus Van Wyck, and J. Buxton Williams, Jr., were
		  active, polite and graceful, and the visitors, notwithstanding the anxieties of
		  war, expressed themselves as well pleased.</p>
          <p>The Seniors of 1863 numbered only eight. As they were so few, I name
		  them here as well as in the Appendix:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>Thomas M. Argo, Wetumpka, Ala.</item>
            <item>Thomas T. Broyles, Anderson C. H., S. C.</item>
            <item>Titus W. Carr, Pitt County.</item>
            <item>John L. Carroll, Kenansville.</item>
            <item>Edward Hines, Craven County.</item>
            <item>Matthias M. Marshal, Pittsboro.</item>
            <item>Wm. L. Quarles, Minden, La.</item>
            <item>Warner M. Watkins, Milton.</item>
          </list>
          <pb xml:id="p731" n="731"/>
          <p>It started Freshmen with eighty members. The Graduates were two less
		  than the Trustees present.</p>
          <p>Argo was the best scholar, Quarles won the second distinction, and
		  Hines and Watkins the third. Carroll, of Kenansville, joined the Senior Class,
		  and was one of the best during that year.</p>
          <p>Of the honor men, Argo was a Lieutenant, Solicitor of the Fourth
		  District of North Carolina, member of the Legislature, is a strong lawyer;
		  Quarles died early, as did Hines; Watkins is a merchant; Carroll became a
		  Doctor of Divinity in the Baptist Church, and died while pastor at Chapel
		  Hill.</p>
          <p>Of those who gained no distinction, Broyles is a physician; Carr was a
		  Lieutenant, a planter and merchant; Marshall is an Episcopal minister,
		  President of the Diocesan Convention of his Church and a Delegate to the
		  General Convention, Doctor of Divinity.</p>
          <p>Of other matriculates with the class, Kerr Craige was a Captain,
		  member of the Legislature, Collector of Internal Revenue and Assistant
		  Postmaster-General; Charles W. Broadfoot Colonel, leader at the bar, Trustee
		  University of North Carolina; Thomas Badger, Sergeant, Mayor of Raleigh, Judge
		  of the City Court; John W. Hinsdale, Colonel, very prominent lawyer; Gabriel
		  Johnston, in the Confederate service, Doctor of Divinity in the Episcopal
		  Church of Canada; James McKee, Lieutenant, physician, Superintendent of the
		  Central Hospital for the Insane; Robert B. Peebles, Assistant Adjutant-General,
		  member of the Legislature, Trustee of the University of North Carolina, Judge
		  of the Superior Court.</p>
          <p>One matriculate during the year, John J. Philips, Private, was among
		  the Confederate dead.</p>
          <p>In the Fall of 1863 a bonus of $500 was voted to each Professor
		  on account of the depreciation of Confederate currency. This was not a
		  munificent gift, as the depreciation was fifteen to one, and the bonus,
		  measured in gold, was only $33, and a salary of $2,000 only
		  $133. A year afterwards Indian corn was quoted at $25 per bushel,
		  flour $150 per barrel, beef $2 per pound.</p>
          <p>The following statement shows more clearly the difficulties of
		  salaried men in supplying their tables.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p732" n="732"/>
          <p>In the fall of 1862 bacon cost 33 cents a pound, in 1863 $1, in
		  1864 $5.50. In March, 1865, $7.50 per pound.</p>
          <p>At the same dates beef was 12 cents, 50 cents, $2.50 and
		  $3 per pound.</p>
          <p>At the same dates Indian corn was $1.10, $5.50,
		  $20 and $30 per bushel.</p>
          <p>At the same dates flour was $18, $35, $125 and
		  $500 per barrel.</p>
          <p>At the same dates coffee was $2.50, none in market, $15
		  and $40 per pound.</p>
          <p>At the same dates sugar was 75 cents, $1.60, $12 and
		  $30 per pound.</p>
          <p>The $500 bonus of 1863 therefore was only worth about 500
		  pounds of bacon, or 84 bushels of corn, or 14 barrels of flour. In truth it is
		  a mystery that the professors lived without actual suffering, and, to their
		  credit be it spoken, uncomplainingly, indeed, except when the tidings of
		  disaster came in, even cheerfully.</p>
          <p>To follow in a small degree the depreciation of the currency, the
		  charge for tuition was raised from $60 to $100.</p>
          <p>The conscription law of the Confederate States bore hard upon the
		  University. It prevented young men from coming, and it carried off students
		  already within its walls. President Swain was authorized in October, 1863, to
		  request from President Davis the exemption of all liable until the end of the
		  session, and in addition the exemption of all young men advanced in liberal
		  studies. He was further instructed to open correspondence with other
		  institutions of learning in order to secure co-operation in this regard.</p>
          <p>He addressed a carefully written letter to President Davis in support
		  of this resolution. He stated that of the eight Seniors who received the first
		  distinction in 1860, four were in the grave and the fifth a wounded prisoner.
		  The Freshman Class of eighty pressed into service with such impetuosity that
		  only one remained to graduate. Even he had entered the army and been discharged
		  on account of ill health.</p>
          <p>The Faculty at that time numbered fourteen, of whom five volunteered.
		  One had returned from a long imprisonment in Ohio with ruined constitution.
		  (Johnston) A second was a wounded prisoner. A third fell at Gettysburg
		  (Royster).</p>
          <pb xml:id="p733" n="733"/>
          <p>The nine remaining members of the Faculty with one exception, were
		  clergymen, or laymen beyond the age of conscription. Their sons, if of military
		  age, had volunteered. Five of them, so liable, were in active service. One was
		  mortally wounded (J. C. Battle) at South Mountain, another (W. L. Battle) at
		  Gettysburg.</p>
          <p>Besides, in the village of Chapel Hill, dependent on the University,
		  fifteen had already been killed.</p>
          <p>The number of students was 63. The enforcement of the Conscript Act
		  would carry off nine or ten young men. With diminution of our income, and a
		  slender endowment, it was difficult to sustain the institution. The
		  conscription of students would make no appreciable addition to the
		  army—their withdrawal from the institution might very seriously affect
		  our organization, and its ultimate effects close the doors of the oldest
		  University now accessible.</p>
          <p>Orders were issued to grant the exemptions, President Davis saying
		  that he would not grind up the seed corn. Col. Peter Mallett, the Commandant of
		  Conscripts, expressed his gratification and pride in perusing President's
		  Swain's Report, and stated that it would be filed in his office with pride as a
		  North Carolinian, as a relic rather than as a public document.</p>
          <p>The necessities of the war did not allow the exemptions, however, to
		  extend beyond the Senior and Junior classes, then in attendance, to whom the
		  promise had been given. When this became known on March 5th, 1864, by direction
		  of the Board, the Secretary-Treasurer, Manly, forwarded a petition to Secretary
		  of War Seddon. It was stated that there were nine members of the Senior Class;
		  two had enlisted, two had substitutes, two had seen hard service in the army,
		  one was under eighteen, and one was permanently disabled.</p>
          <p>The Junior Class had fifteen members. Of these seven had substitutes,
		  five have been killed in the army, two were under eighteen years of age, one
		  had died. At the close of the Sophomore year the class had fifteen more
		  members, all of whom were supposed to be in the army.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore Class at the end of their Freshman year had twenty-four
		  members, of whom sixteen were supposed to be in the army. Of the nine
		  remaining, three were exempt on <pb xml:id="p734" n="734"/>account of physical
		  disability. Of the remaining six, one had a substitute, an Englishman over
		  conscript age; another was in delicate health.</p>
          <p>Of the twenty-seven members of the Freshman Class, twenty-four were
		  under age. Of the remaining three one had a substitute, leaving two only who
		  were legally and morally bound.</p>
          <p>It was thus seen that the conscription applied to the lower classes
		  would have added very few to the army, while it might have closed the
		  University, one of the oldest and largest in the Confederacy, and disband the
		  able and venerable band of instructors in their declining years.</p>
          <p>To this request Mr. Seddon made the cold reply, “I cannot see in
		  the grounds presented such peculiar or exceptional circumstances as will
		  justify departure from the rule acted on in many similar instances. Youths
		  under eighteen will be allowed to continue their studies; those over, capable
		  of military service, will best discharge their duty, and find their highest
		  training in defending their country in the field.”</p>
          <p>Of course the students subject to conscription at once without
		  compulsion volunteered, and others accompanied them. There was an advantage in
		  volunteering in that the soldier could select his regiment, and so be
		  associated with friends.</p>
          <p>For the year 1864-1865 there were only sixty matriculates, Senior
		  Class fifteen, Junior Class two, Slover and Smith. The first distinction was
		  awarded to Smith, the second to Slover. Sophomore Class had twelve, two of whom
		  were absent from examinations. The Freshman had twenty-one. Partial course
		  students ten. Three were from Arkansas, three from Virginia, one from
		  Tennessee, the rest from North Carolina. The catalogues for this year and for
		  1865-'66 were printed under one cover.</p>
          <p>A letter from Dr. Charles Phillips states that half a month after the
		  beginning of the Fall term only forty-six students had appeared.</p>
          <p>On 10th December, 1863, leave was granted to Prof. Hepburn to be
		  absent for one year. He took charge of a Church in Wilmington in this State.
		  When the Federals marched into the city he was selected to meet the troops and
		  surrender the city. His speech was misinterpreted in some quarters as being
		  <pb xml:id="p735" n="735"/>too friendly in tone, but the harsh criticisms were
		  found to be unjust. After leaving the University in 1868 he accepted a
		  professorship in Davidson College, and afterwards became its President. This
		  place he resigned and became a professor in Miami University.</p>
          <p>Dr. Hepburn's career in North Carolina was distinguished for excellent
		  scholarship, inspiring teaching and preaching, a style in writing which was a
		  model of pure English and for the lofty virtues of a gentleman and a Christian.
		  As an administrator, he aimed at cultivating self-government among the
		  students, trust and confidence in their relations to the Faculty, instead of
		  fear and distrust. He aimed to give them the principles of high manly
		  character, which could not be done by surrounding them with irritating checks
		  and prohibitions. Of this manner of treatment, now generally adopted, he was a
		  pioneer. It required bold initiative to begin it.</p>
          <p>In October, 1864, Senator Wm. A. Graham was requested to call on
		  President Davis with the view of procuring a general exemption of students.
		  Governor Vance and Secretary Manly were requested to urge Lieutenant-General
		  Theophilus Holmes, in command at Raleigh, to approve the request. Two of the
		  Trustees opposed the motion as being against the interests of the Confederacy,
		  and called for a vote by ayes and noes. It was carried, Chief Justice Ruffin,
		  President Swain, ex-Governor Manly, Daniel M. Barringer, John H. Bryan, Kemp P.
		  Battle, B. F. Moore, Samuel F. Patterson, Jesse G. Shepherd, Charles E. Shober,
		  Edward Warren, and Mason L. Wiggins in the affirmative, and Judge M. E. Manly
		  and Treasurer D. W. Courts in the negative. The resolution led to no
		  results.</p>
          <p>At the same meeting the Committee on the Salaries of the Faculty
		  recommended that $500 be added to the salaries of the President and
		  Professors, and the Governor was requested to procure easy rates of
		  transportation of supplies in their behalf. The report was adopted.</p>
          <p>President Swain and Daniel M. Barringer were appointed a Committee to
		  report on the advisability of the University buying supplies of food and
		  reselling to the Faculty at cost. The Committee favored the scheme, but the
		  matter was referred to the Executive Committee, who found it impracticable.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p736" n="736"/>
          <p>What made matters worse was that the bank passed a dividend, and the
		  Board was forced to borrow $8,000 in order to pay the professors.</p>
          <p>To relieve their privations to some extent, the Faculty were allowed
		  to cut fire-wood from the University forests, and the same liberty was granted
		  to the widow of Tutor George B. Johnston, who had died in service.</p>
          <p>On the 17th February, 1864, the Treasurer was ordered to cease
		  receiving Confederate currency from those owing old debts. Specie according to
		  the legislative scale was then one to twenty-one. The Treasury then had a large
		  amount, viz., $29,992 of Confederate notes and other war securities.</p>
          <p>In a letter to Hon. Daniel M. Barringer in December, 1864, Dr. Charles
		  Phillips gave a sketch of what the University had done in the way of teaching
		  military tactics. When the war broke out the students were spending their
		  leisure hours in drilling under the direction of Mr. (afterwards
		  Brigadier-General) Lilly. Then Professor William J. Martin, before joining the
		  army, continued the work, the participating in it being elective and not
		  counted in the University course. Afterwards Lieutenant Frederick Fetter, who
		  had served in the Bethel regiment, gave similar instruction to all students, as
		  a part of the curriculum. This instruction was suspended on his reentry into
		  the army. The Faculty had often discussed the importance of military science
		  and the demand for it; to what extent it could be introduced into the
		  University curriculum, the expensiveness and other difficulties in procuring
		  properly qualified teachers, books and apparatus; whether it would increase the
		  danger to the property of the institution in case of a hostile raid. The
		  Faculty appointed Dr. James Phillips and Messrs. H. H. Smith and John Kimberly
		  to report on the subject. They recommended that instruction should be given on
		  Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoons and on Saturday; that the attendance should
		  be compulsory, and that the drill-master should not be below the grade of
		  Captain. The Faculty resolved:</p>
          <p>I. That for the present a renewal of the military drill among the
		  students of the University be recommended to the Trustees thereof, together
		  with such instruction in Tactics and Engineering as can be provided, with
		  suitable books and apparatus.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p737" n="737"/>
          <p>II. That the minutiæ of this plan could be determined only with
		  the help of the teachers whom the Trustees may select to superintend it.</p>
          <p>Col. W. J. Martin, who was seriously wounded, was in hospital in
		  Wilmington. On being consulted, he gave it as his opinion that some day, if the
		  Southern Confederacy should not establish a national military academy, such as
		  that at West Point, it might be best to establish one or more military
		  professorships at the University. At present, however, all that could be done
		  is to give some incidental instruction in drill and the general principles of
		  the military art, provided that the plan will add to the patronage. The studies
		  of the course should not be diminished; all the work for making soldiers should
		  be outside the regular course. As to the possibility of his being detailed for
		  this service, he could not answer intelligently. His trip from Richmond to
		  Wilmington had set back his wound, and it would be at least a month before he
		  would be fit for any service whatever.</p>
          <p>As showing how the ablest men can be deceived by their sanguine
		  temper, I quote sentences of Colonel Martin's letter: “The news we have
		  from the line of the railroad is encouraging. Hampton and Hill are said to have
		  routed Grant's raiding party at Belfield, and Leventhorpe to have done the same
		  at Tarboro. I wish I could know that a similar fate has befallen Sherman. I
		  confess I am afraid of him. The Yankees will raise such a howl of delight if he
		  gets through to the coast, and our croakers will put on such long faces. Yet
		  the real damage done will be slight, except to individuals.”</p>
          <p>The vicissitudes of the war prevented the realization of the project
		  for introducing military instruction. Col. Martin's letter was dated December,
		  1864. On the 22d of February, 1865, Schofield entered Wilmington. On April 9th
		  General Lee surrendered.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1864 was held under a still deeper gloom. There
		  were only seven Seniors of a class which as Freshmen numbered sixty-eight, as
		  Sophomores thirty-five, as Juniors nine. Mr. Williams was the only member who
		  joined as Freshman. The class started with nine, but two died at Chapel Hill
		  during the year. Two others buried their mothers, <pb xml:id="p738" n="738"/>one
		  within a month of Commencement Day, the other on that day. All the seven were
		  enlisted in the Confederate army and two were absent in Georgia attending to
		  their duties as Staff Officers. Of the Faculty when the class joined, one-fifth
		  had been killed, two others bore marks of wounds received in battle, and one
		  had been active as private and officer since the battle of Bethel.</p>
          <p>Rev. Dr. Charles F. Deems preached the Baccalaureate sermon. It was an
		  exhortation to the Seniors, and to all his hearers, to cultivate always and
		  everywhere love to God.</p>
          <p>There were only two Sophomores left at the end of the year, the seven
		  others who started with the class being with the army. Hence there were no
		  Sophomore Declaimers.</p>
          <p>At the <choice><sic>beginnng</sic><corr>beginning</corr></choice>of the session the
		  Freshman Class had twenty-eight members; at the close only thirteen. These
		  furnished the following Declaimers: Herbert H. Mallett, of Chapel Hill; Patrick
		  H. Winston, of Windsor, Albert G. Carr, of Chapel Hill; Andrew J. Burton, of
		  Halifax County; William C. McAdoo, Greensboro; Robert W. Means, of Cabarrus;
		  Fabius H. Busbee, Raleigh. Mr. Busbee was thought to be the best and Winston
		  next. They all graduated except Mallett, Burton and McAdoo. Mallett joined the
		  army and became a planter in Louisiana; Burton was an Adjutant in the army, a
		  lawyer and State Senator.</p>
          <p>The Trustees present were, besides Governor Vance, President Swain,
		  ex-Governor Manly, Judges Battle and Manly, and Mr. Paul C. Cameron. Judge
		  Manly during the war resided at his country seat at Hillsboro, and hence his
		  attendance.</p>
          <p>The Marshals were vigilant and efficient in keeping order. They were
		  Peter H. Adams, Chief, Greensboro; John S. Henderson, Salisbury; Henry A.
		  London, Jr., Pittsboro, and Nathaniel K. Roan, of Yanceyville.</p>
          <p>There was excellent music by the band of the 43rd regiment. The leader
		  was a Mr. Wyess.</p>
          <p>The Senior speeches, although meagre in number, were good in quality.
		  Guthrie spoke the Latin Salutatory; Boozer on the “Omnipresence of
		  God”; Williams on the “Career of Hannibal,” and Gilmer the
		  Valedictory. Tate was providentially prevented from speaking, and Clark and Van
		  Wyck were with the army.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p739" n="739"/>
          <p>The following is the meagre list of the Seniors of 1864:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>Albert M. Boozer, Lexington C. H., S. C.</item>
            <item>Walter McK. Clark, Halifax County.</item>
            <item>James C. Gilmer, Mt. Airy.</item>
            <item>William A. Guthrie, Chapel Hill.</item>
            <item>Alfred C. B. Holt, Augusta, Ga.</item>
            <item>William R. Kenan, Kenansville.</item>
            <item>John P. Rogers, Wake County.</item>
            <item>James Turner Tate, Gaston County.</item>
            <item>Augustus Van Wyck, Pendleton, S. C.</item>
            <item>J. Buxton Williams, Jr., Warren County.</item>
          </list>
          <p>The first honor was gained by Gilmer, the second by Guthrie and Tate;
		  the third by Boozer and Van Wyck. Clark was present in the Senior year only. He
		  was one of the best scholars during that year.</p>
          <p>Of these honor men Gilmer is a teacher of repute; Guthrie was a
		  Confederate soldier, and is a very prominent lawyer and a Trustee of the
		  University; Tate was a manufacturer and banker; Boozer is Clerk of the Supreme
		  Court of South Carolina; Van Wyck Judge of the Supreme Court of New York, and
		  was the Democratic candidate for the Governorship of New York against
		  Roosevelt. Clark, who has dropped his middle name, is Chief Justice of the
		  Supreme Court of North Carolina, after having been a Confederate
		  Lieutenant-Colonel and Judge of the Superior and Supreme Courts.</p>
          <p>Of those matriculating with the class, William L. Church was a
		  Captain, a minister, a physician, and Professor in the University of Georgia;
		  Tim Erwin Cooper Judge of the Supreme Court of Mississippi; Tazewell Hargrove
		  in Confederate service and in the Legislature and State Attorney-General;
		  William N. Mebane in the Confederate service, State Senator and Representative,

		  Olin Wellborn, Colonel and Representative in Congress; Alonzo C. Whitner, Judge
		  of the Superior Court of Florida.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p740" n="740"/>
          <p>One matriculate of the year, William H. G. Webb, Lieutenant, is the
		  last of the “Confederate Dead” of the University.</p>
          <p>The honorary degree of Master of Arts was conferred upon Rev. Francis
		  W. Hilliard and Norval W. Wilson, both of North Carolina.</p>
          <p>Of the other graduates, Holt was in the Confederate army and is a
		  lawyer; Kenan an Adjutant of a regiment and afterwards a commission merchant;
		  Williams was also in the Confederate service and then a physician; Rogers died
		  during the war.</p>
          <p>In December, 1864, on motion of Colonel D. M. Barringer, a special
		  gold bond of $100 was issued to the Secretary and Treasurer, and to each
		  member of the Faculty, payable two years after the close of the war. This
		  afforded decided relief, as the bonds were of much greater value than the paper
		  currency in use. They were taken at par in part of salaries.</p>
          <p>The privilege of cutting fuel from the University lands was extended
		  twelve months longer, to be under the supervision of President Swain and Judge
		  Battle, Bursar Fetter to mark the trees which it was allowable to fell. It is
		  needless perhaps to state that there was extensive pillaging on the part of
		  families in no wise connected with the University. They adopted the philosophy
		  of an old Wake County man, “God made the trees for all, and no one man
		  has the right to make them his own.” Then, too, they said that while the
		  soldiers were fighting and dying amid privations, their families must not
		  suffer at home. Nor were the negro choppers careful to wait for the inspection
		  of the Bursar or for his marks before using the fateful axe. Many acres nearest
		  to the village were completely stripped, and thousands of stately oaks and
		  hickories were laid low in these years, when the wolf was howling at the
		  door.</p>
          <p>A leading spirit in those dark days was Mrs. Cornelia Phillips
		  Spencer, only daughter of the Professor of Mathematics, Rev. Dr. James
		  Phillips. She was brought to Chapel Hill from Harlem, New York, when a year
		  old, and therefore was almost a native of the village. She married in 1853
		  James Magnus Spencer, of Alabama, an alumnus of large brain and great force of
		  character. His early death left her with one child, and she removed to her old
		  home, and there resided until <pb xml:id="p741" n="741"/>she joined her daughter
		  Julia, wife of Professor James Lee Love, of Harvard University. During all of
		  her life—even now when she has passed her four score years—in her
		  distant home, this University and its village, all their past and present, are
		  precious to her.</p>
          <p>Possessed of unusual intellectual endowments and an elegant style, she
		  has written to illuminate the University's past many sketches of the
		  Professors, and social life at Chapel Hill, and by her letters to the press,
		  and inspiring odes, she aided to keep it from being forgotten, when, by adverse
		  circumstances, it lay apparently dying. Her heart was constantly with our
		  “Boys in Gray,” and no one was more ready or more energetic in
		  sympathizing with their trials and relieving their wants. The obituary notices
		  she wrote of those whom she knew are models of graceful style and fragrant with
		  tender sympathy.</p>
          <p>At the suggestion of President Swain, she published a book, deeply
		  interesting, now out of print and much sought after, the “Last Ninety
		  Days of the War in North Carolina.” The President supplied her with many
		  facts, and she obtained others by correspondence with such public men as
		  Governor Vance, ex-Governors Graham and Manly, and with many private citizens
		  who had suffered by the looting of the soldiers. She is our authority for the
		  incidents connected with the occupation of Chapel Hill by the Federal
		  forces.</p>
          <p>On the 14th day of April, 1865, Wheeler's Cavalry reached Chapel Hill.
		  As they had acquired the character of having loose notions with regard to
		  movable property, there was danger of loss of books and apparatus of the
		  University. Fortunately, there was with the army a graduate of the University
		  of 1859 a citizen of Knoxville, Tennessee, James P. Coffin, who had fought
		  throughout the war, and was in Hume's division of Wheeler's corps, serving as
		  Inspector-General on the staff of Colonel Henry M. Ashby, commanding the
		  brigade in the place of General Hume, wounded. The last stand made by the
		  retreating force was at Morrisville, though there was a skirmish at the farm of
		  widow Atkins near New Hope. At the request of Coffin, General Wheeler detailed
		  Lieutenant McBurney Broyles, of the 5th Tennessee Cavalry, with fifteen men,
		  with orders to report to President Swain and obey his instructions.
		  <pb xml:id="p742" n="742"/>The President was in Raleigh on the mission, with
		  ex-Governor Graham, to surrender the city of Raleigh and ask for protection of
		  public property, the care of the University in his absence being left with
		  Professor Charles Phillips. The headquarters of General Wheeler were in a
		  building opposite the Episcopal Church, since torn down. There Captain Coffin
		  learned of the surrender of General Lee. The next day he had charge of the
		  rearguard and cleared the town of all stragglers.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Spencer describes Wheeler's men as wretchedly poor. A Lieutenant,
		  who had been a student of the University from Tennessee, had just learned of
		  the burning of his home by the enemy, his wife and child being penniless, told
		  her that he had only a twenty-five cent Confederate note and his horse. When
		  informed that Lee had surrendered he burst into tears. Some few of the soldiers
		  appeared demoralized, but most were full of pluck. A general officer commented
		  on the visit of ex-Governors Swain and Graham to Sherman's headquarters by
		  tersely saying that they ought to be shot. One poor fellow, wounded at
		  Morrisville, was carried to the residence of one of the leading physicians,
		  “talked of his home in Alabama, sent messages to his mother, begged the
		  lovely girl, who was watching over him, to kiss him for his sister's sake, and
		  died in child-like patience.”</p>
          <p>I quote Mrs. Spencer's description of the entry of the Federal
		  Cavalry:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>“General Wheeler and his men left on the 16th April at two P. M.
		  A few hours of absolute and Sabbath stillness and silence ensued. The groves
		  stood thick and solemn, the bright sun shining through the great boles and down
		  the grassy slopes, while a pleasant fragrance was wafted from the purple
		  panicles of the Paullonias. All that Nature could do was still done, with order
		  and beauty, while men's hearts were failing them for fear and for looking after
		  those things which were coming on the earth.</p>
            <p>“We sat in our pleasant piazzas and awaited events with quiet
		  resignation. Our silver had all been buried. There was not much provision to be
		  carried off. The sight of our empty store-rooms and smoke-houses would be
		  likely to move our <pb xml:id="p743" n="743"/>invaders to laughter. But there was
		  anxiety as to the fate of the University buildings, libraries and portraits.
		  About sunset a sedate looking officer with a small squad of cavalry rode in.
		  President Swain, with a few citizens, met them and told the officer of General
		  Sherman's promise of protection to University and village. He replied that he
		  had received the orders and they should be heeded. He then made inquiry for
		  rebels, and on being informed that they had all left, he returned to
		  camp.”</p>
          </q>
          <p>About eight o'clock the next day, the 17th, General Smith B. Atkins,
		  of Freeport, Illinois, with four thousand cavalry, took possession of the town,
		  and the citizens for the first time in four years saw unfurled the Stars and
		  Stripes, which once they loved so well, and of late correspondingly hated.</p>
          <p>General Sherman's orders were obeyed, and all the dwellings in the
		  town, as well as the University property, were well guarded. The soldiers
		  detailed for this purpose from the 9th Michigan Cavalry were especially noted
		  for civility and propriety.</p>
          <p>The persistency of President Swain in keeping up the exercises of the
		  institution was evident from the fact that when the Federal troops took
		  possession of the village there were about a dozen students, mostly residents
		  of Chapel Hill, on hand to witness the novel spectacle. Those from a distance
		  had repaired to their homes, starting on foot, as vehicles were not
		  obtainable.</p>
          <p>The President returned to the Hill on the 15th. Four days afterward he
		  wrote to General Sherman that Wheeler's men had to a considerable extent, and
		  afterwards the Federal soldiers, denuded the country of forage and had taken a
		  number of horses and mules. Many families outside the village had been stripped
		  of the means of subsistence, among them a Baptist preacher, Rev. Dr. Purefoy,
		  who had a family, white and colored, of over fifty persons, with no provisions
		  and not a horse or mule. He hoped that the General would relax the severity of
		  his orders, and believed that General Atkins would welcome the change.</p>
          <p>General Sherman replied on the 22nd that as soon as war should cease,
		  “seizure of horses and private property will cease. <pb xml:id="p744" n="744"/>Some animals for the use of the farmers may then be spared. As soon
		  as peace comes the Federals will be the friends of the farmers and working
		  classes, as well as actual patrons of churches, colleges, asylums and
		  institutions of learning and charity.”</p>
          <p>This correspondence shows that, away from places where guards were
		  posted as an especial favor, plundering of the country people was allowed by
		  the military authorities over ten days after Lee's surrender. There was much
		  robbery, too, by stragglers and other unauthorized men, called
		  “Bummers.” Outrages to females were forbidden, and the orders were
		  obeyed. I heard of no burning of houses in this part of the world traceable to
		  the soldiers.</p>
          <p>It was during the time that General Atkins was stationed at Chapel
		  Hill that he wooed and won Eleanor, the beautiful daughter of President Swain.
		  The General ingratiated himself with our people by his fairness and courtesy.
		  He was a man of fine appearance and of high character, the editor of an
		  influential paper in Freeport. Still the people living in the line of Sherman's
		  march, who had suffered much by the plundering of his army, could not forget
		  that Atkin's brigade was a part of it, and heard of the match with disapproval.
		  It distinctly weakened the President's popularity, though he never seemed to
		  realize the loss.</p>
          <p>I have alluded to the bringing home of the bodies of our Chapel Hill
		  soldiers who lost their lives in the war. Mrs. Spencer gives a pathetic
		  narrative especially of the burial of two sons of the University, Corporal
		  Junius C. and Lieutenant W. Lewis, youngest sons of Judge Battle, the first
		  having received a mortal wound at South Mountain and the other at Gettysburg,
		  one of the foremost in the famous Pickett's Charge. They came home on the 16th
		  of April, 1866, the whole population pouring out to meet them. “They were
		  placed side by side in that Church whose aisles their infant feet had trodden.
		  The plain deal boxes that enclosed them were graced with garlands, and the
		  emblem of the holy faith in which they had died, more than conquerors, woven of
		  the flowers of their own dear native State.”</p>

          <p>“It was something—it was much that we could lay them among
		  their own familiar hills, pleasant in their lives and undivided in their
		  deaths.”</p>
          <p>Probably no community in the South took deeper interest in the
		  military operations than Chapel Hill. No community experienced more acute
		  griefs on account of the tragedies of battlefields and hospitals. The
		  inhabitants were so few that the students were known to all, either personally
		  or by reputation. Their careers were watched with the interest which followed
		  the movements of near friends and brothers. Great was the joy over victories
		  and promotions of “our boys” to higher rank for gallantry in
		  fighting or talent in strategy or tactics. And then came the gloom and the
		  tears over the killed and wounded, sometimes over the mournful burials of
		  bodies brought home.</p>
          <p>Many times the wounded fell into the hands of the Federals, and then
		  there were the tortures of suspense—to be ended in some cases with news
		  of deaths, after painful lingering, in others by the tidings that the dear son
		  or brother was in a grave, undecorated, unknown.</p>
          <p>The seclusion of Chapel Hill, the distance from the railroad, the
		  absence of telegraph wires, added to the nervous anxieties as to happenings at
		  the front, and almost unsettled reason. Imagination not corrected by facts, fed
		  itself with fancied triumphs or dismal forebodings. Partial successes were
		  exaggerated into “glorious victories,” and inconclusive defeats
		  into complete annihilation.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p746" n="746"/>
          <p>Of course the excited feelings found expression in speech. It was the
		  fashion to heap on Yankees, as all Northerners were called, the vilest epithets
		  conceivable, and similar language was used against all in the South who
		  sympathized with them, or who hinted at the possibility of the ultimate
		  restoration of the Union. It is said that the denunciations of W. W. Holden,
		  afterwards Governor, in Chapel Hill circles determined him to deprive of their
		  seats all the old Faculty. This he had power to do, because he appointed and
		  controlled the Board of Education and the Board elected the Trustees.</p>
          <p>The population of Chapel Hill was increased by some excellent families
		  from Edenton, Newbern, Wilmington, and other places, who were unwilling to be
		  under Federal domination, or in imminent danger of it. Those of Mr. William A.
		  Wright and Dr. Armand J. DeRossett, Rev. Dr. Samuel I. Johnston, and others,
		  polished and intelligent, rented houses, and for four years became virtual
		  citizens of the village. They assisted and were aided in bearing the burdens of
		  the common trials. They bore their part in supporting churches and charities.
		  When the war ended it was a keen regret to lose their gracious manners and
		  kindly hearts.</p>
          <p>General Lee surrendered his army on the 9th of April, 1865. The tramp
		  of the conquering bluecoats was still heard in the village. It certainly showed
		  wonderful pluck on the part of the President to have Commencement exercises.
		  They occupied only two days, Wednesday and Thursday, at the usual time in June.
		  The thought of our soldiers in distant graves, the general poverty and the
		  political uncertainty made this a gloomy festival. President Swain was absent
		  in Washington on the invitation of President Johnson to advise about
		  Reconstruction.</p>
          <p>There was, as to be expected, small attendance from a distance. The
		  only Trustees present were Judge Battle, ex-Governor Graham and Hon. Samuel F.
		  Phillips. Mr. William C. Prout was the only graduate who completed the course.
		  Fourteen began the Senior year. Only three, besides Prout, were able to be
		  present and deliver their speeches.</p>
          <p>Rev. G. F. Bahnsen, Bishop of the United Brethren (Moravians) in North
		  Carolina, preached the Baccalaureate sermon <pb xml:id="p747" n="747"/>on the text,
		  “Whither of the Twain will ye that I release unto you?” He showed
		  that the choice between Christ and Mammon, between Light and Darkness, between
		  Good and Evil, was before every nation, every community, every person.
		  Eloquently and with deep emotions the preacher urged his audience to make the
		  right choice.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore Class furnished the only competitors: Andrew J. Burton,
		  of Halifax County; Winfield S. Guthrie, of Chapel Hill; Albert G. Carr, of
		  Chapel Hill, and Robert W. Means, of Cabarrus County. The audience was very
		  complimentary.</p>
          <p>The Address before the two Literary Societies was by Judge William H.
		  Battle, LL.D., Class of 1820. He gave a clear and interesting history of the
		  foundation and beginnings of the University, and showed the great work it had
		  done for the State and the nation. He sketched the careers of two students of
		  the early days, of extraordinary brilliancy of intellect, cut off in early life
		  by dissipated habits, and urged their careers as warnings to all young men.
		  They were Wm. Allen and Wm. Cherry. Judge Battle won the thanks of the friends
		  of the University for being willing in those exciting times—<hi rend="italics"><foreign xml:lang="lat">inter arma</foreign></hi>—to keep up
		  its time honored custom of the Anniversary oration.</p>
          <p>I copy all the names of the Senior Class in the eventful year of
		  1865:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>Adams, Peter Henry, Greensboro.</item>
            <item>Askew, Abner H., Hertford County.</item>

            <item>Montague, Alexander, Wake County.</item>
            <item>Prout, Edmund G., Williamsboro.</item>
            <item>Prout, William C., Williamsboro.</item>
            <item>Richardson, Milton C., Johnston County.</item>
            <item>Roan, Nathaniel K., Yanceyville.</item>

          </list>
          <pb xml:id="p748" n="748"/>
          <p>Of the Seniors who thus upheld the customs of the University under
		  adverse circumstances, W. C. Prout is an Episcopal minister: E. G. Sprout, who
		  was in the Confederate army, is also an Episcopal minister; Shepard is a man of
		  wealth, living in Paris, France, though retaining his North Carolina
		  citizenship; London was a Confederate soldier, is a lawyer, journalist, State
		  Senator, Trustee of the University.</p>
          <p>Of the other members of the class, Adams was a Confederate Scout;
		  Austin is a merchant; Bryan was in military service and is now a planter;
		  Henderson also joined the army, is a lawyer, and was State Senator, Code
		  Commissioner, Representative in Congress; Huff is a physician; Richardson is a
		  lawyer; Roan joined the army and then was a merchant.</p>
          <p>The Senior orators were as follows, the first three not having
		  finished the course, on account of being off on public duty, but being allowed
		  to graduate:</p>
          <p>“Uneasy Lies the Head that Wears the Crown,” Edmund G.
		  Prout, Williamsboro.</p>
          <p>“Music,” John R. D. Shepard, Raleigh.</p>
          <p>“The Crusades,” Henry A. London, Jr., Pittsboro.</p>
          <p>“The Past, Present and Future of Our University,” with the
		  Valedictory, Wm. C. Prout, of Williamsboro.</p>
          <p>No Junior was present at the examination of this year. Five
		  represented the Sophomore Class, and only two Freshmen.</p>
          <p>The Chief Marshal was A. J. Burton, and his assistants were A. G.
		  Carr, W. S. Guthrie, R. W. Means and A. K. Tenny. It was noted that, howbeit
		  their duties were not arduous, their manners were graceful and their work
		  efficient.</p>
          <p>It is worthy of record that by the order of General Kilpatrick, a
		  guard of thirty-five men, under Lieutenant Bradley, of the 10th Ohio Regiment,
		  were detailed from General Atkins' Brigade of Cavalry to preserve the
		  University property. A contemporary statement by a careful observer certifies
		  that the guards were present during the Commencement exercises, were vigilant
		  for the protection of the property under their charge, and courteous to the
		  citizens of Chapel Hill and the vicinity.” While the kindness is
		  attributed to General Kilpatrick, it is well known that the real benefactor was
		  General Atkins, the officer in immediate command of the troops.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p749" n="749"/>
          <p>It is believed that the University of North Carolina was the only
		  institution of rank, for males or females, which had Commencement exercises in
		  the terrible year of 1865.</p>
          <p>It is proper here to give a summary of facts showing the part taken by
		  the University in the Civil War. Its younger professors and teachers and its
		  alumni and students of military age rushed into the conflict with all the elan
		  of Southern character. Out of a Faculty of fourteen, six volunteered for the
		  war, the others being clergymen or too old for service, one of them, Martin,
		  rising to be a Lieutenant-Colonel. Out of the five Tutors, four lost their
		  lives, all very promising, Johnston, Royster, Bryan and Anderson. Of former
		  members of the Faculty three, Spruill, Alexander and Morrow, were killed.</p>
          <p>I extract from a paper drawn up by Dr. H. B. Battle at my request for
		  the 5th volume of Regimental Histories, edited by Chief Justice Clark, showing
		  what the University did for the Confederate war. I add also facts published by
		  Dr. Stephen B. Weeks in an address, delivered at the University Centennial of
		  1895:</p>
          <p>
            <list type="simple">
              <item>Number of students 1830-1867, less those who died prior to
				1861. . . . . 2,592</item>
              <item>The total number who entered the army 1861-'65 was . . . . .
				1,062</item>
              <item/>
            </list>
          </p>
          <p>Therefore forty-two out of every hundred became soldiers.</p>
          <p>Of the younger alumni 1850-1862, there were . . . . . 1,478 of whom
		  842 entered the army, or 57 out of every hundred. </p>
          <p>The University had in the service one Lieutenant-General, one
		  Major-General, thirteen Brigadiers, fifty Colonels, twenty-eight
		  Lieutenant-Colonels, forty Majors, forty-six Adjutants, seventy-one Surgeons,
		  two hundred and fifty-four Captains, one hundred and fifty-five Lieutenants,
		  thirty-eight non-commissioned officers, and three hundred and sixty-five
		  Privates. Of these 312, or 34 per cent were killed or died in service. The
		  Lieutenant-General was Bishop Leonidas Polk, matriculate in 1821, who was
		  killed on Kennesaw Mountain in Georgia. The Major-General was Bryan Grimes, of
		  the Class of 1848; the Brigadier-Generals were Richard C. Gatlin, L. O'B.
		  Branch, J. Johnston Pettigrew, Thomas L. Clingman, Charles W. Phifer, of
		  Mississippi, George B. Anderson, Isham W. Garrott, of <pb xml:id="p750" n="750"/>
		  Alabama, Alfred M. Scales, Matt. W. Ransom, Robert D. Johnston, William Gaston
		  Lewis, Rufus Barringer and John D. Barry. Of these Branch, Pettigrew, Garrott
		  and Anderson were killed.</p>
          <p>Besides these, Adjutant-General R. C. Gatlin and John F. Hoke,
		  Quarter-Master-Generals, and Commissary-General Wm. Johnston were University
		  men. Also Peter E. Hines, Medical Director, and Surgeon E. Burke Haywood, of
		  the General Hospital at Raleigh. Ashley W. Spaight was a Brigadier-General in
		  the Texas service, Thomas C. Manning, Adjutant-General of Louisiana, and Jacob
		  Thompson, of Mississippi, Inspector-General.</p>
          <p>The Memorial Hall of the University has the names of 271 of those who
		  died for the Confederacy. According to rank they were: 1 Lieutenant-General, 4
		  Brigadiers, 12 Colonels, 6 Lieutenant-Colonels, 17 Majors, 4 Adjutants, 2
		  Sergeant-Majors, 5 Surgeons and Assistant Surgeons, 2 Aids, 67 Captains, 69
		  Lieutenants, 23 Sergeants and Corporals, 100 Privates. By subsequent
		  investigations of Dr. S. B. Weeks, this list has been increased to 312.</p>
          <p>Of those regiments which were distinguished by extraordinary losses in
		  battle, the University of North Carolina Colonels led into battle the greater
		  number. The 26th North Carolina, which had a phenomenal loss, one of the
		  greatest in all history, 83 3-10 per cent, was under Henry K. Burgwyn, a
		  matriculate of 1857. The 4th North Carolina, under George B. Anderson, a
		  matriculate of 1847, lost 54 4-10 per cent at Seven Pines; the 18th, under
		  Robert H. Cowan, A.B. 1844, 56 5-10 at Seven Pines; the 1st North Carolina
		  Battalion, under John D. Taylor, graduate of 1853, 57 per cent at Bentonsville;
		  the 33rd North Carolina, under Clarke M. Avery, a graduate of 1839, lost 41
		  4-10 per cent at Chancellorsville.</p>
          <p>The battle of Gettysburg was peculiarly fatal to the University. There

          <p>One of the saddest deaths of the war was that of Lieut.-Col. Edward
		  Mallett, killed at Bentonville, after passing unscathed through many battles,
		  buried in his uniform in the cemetery at Chapel Hill, leaving penniless a wife
		  in the last stages of consumption, and four little children.</p>
          <p>The village of Chapel Hill had little independent trade or
		  manufactures, but was dependent on the University and shared its fortunes. The
		  depth of its poverty was partially relieved by the influx of refugees from
		  Wilmington, Edenton, Newbern and elsewhere. In the earlier months of the war,
		  when soldiers returned on furlough, the usual festivities were gotten up in
		  their honor, but when the news of battle brought news of our young men slain,
		  especially after the fatal casualties at Gettysburg, the sorrow and gloom could
		  not be shaken off. In the touching language of Mrs. Cornelius P. Spencer, who
		  has a heart to feel and a brain to recall the agonies of this period,
		  “The bonds of common sympathy became stronger, as the pangs of common
		  suffering became more intense. * * * People who wept and prayed and rejoiced
		  together, as we did for four years, learned to love each other more. The higher
		  and nobler and more generous impulses of our nature were brought constantly
		  into action, stimulated by the heroic endurance and splendid gallantry of our
		  soldiers.</p>
          <p>When the war ended the difficulties of the restoration of the
		  University to its former prosperity assumed larger proportions. The dividends
		  from bank-stock, four per cent semi-annually, ceased, never to return.
		  Practically the officers of the institution depended for their salaries on
		  tuition receipts, and the number of students diminished each year. This was
		  partly owing to the general poverty, largely to the widespread belief that the
		  institution must soon of necessity close its doors. Parents thought that their
		  sons would lose time by beginning under one Faculty and then transferred to
		  another.</p>
          <p>But President Swain continued to labor with all his former energy.
		  Never did an officer give his whole heart and anxious <pb xml:id="p752" n="752"/>
		  care to the interests of his charge more devotedly than he. Right nobly and
		  with high courage did he meet the loss of patronage and income, and the
		  virulence of unfair criticism. The students were his children, their success
		  brought him unalloyed joy, and his heart sorely felt their failures and was
		  wounded by their deaths.</p>
          <p>In 1864, 1865 and 1866 the professors were nominally the same, but the
		  tutors were reduced to two, Pool and Fetter.</p>
          <p>The Commencement of 1866 was fairly successful for the times. The
		  reporter for the <hi rend="italics">Raleigh Standard</hi>speaks of the
		  University being reviled on one side as being a “Yankee concern”
		  and on the other as being “a hot-bed of rebellion,” epithets which
		  show how sensitive was the public mind in those anomalous days. The former
		  epithet was of course on account of the marriage of the President's daughter to
		  a Federal General. The attendance on the exercises was large.</p>
          <p>The Baccalaureate sermon was preached by Rev. Dr. Charles Phillips. He
		  gave a masterly analysis of Christian Love, and urged it as needed to quiet the
		  passions so prevalent among men.</p>
          <p>The paucity of speeches of the graduating class was compensated for by
		  unprecedented numbers of declaimers. The Freshmen competitors were Platt D.
		  Walker, of Wilmington; Willie Maverick, of Texas; Thomas C. DeRossett, of
		  Wilmington; Blair Burwell, Louisburg; James M. Means, of Cabarrus County;
		  Alfred T. Alston, Warren County; Joseph C. Webb, of Hillsboro; Peter M. Wilson,
		  of Warrenton, Edmund Jones, Jr., of Caldwell; Virginius St. Clair McNider, of
		  Edenton; Alonzo Phillips, of Hillsboro, and George V. Cowper, of Hertford,
		  twelve in number. Messrs. Maverick, DeRossett, Wilson and McNider received the
		  greatest applause.</p>
          <p>On the part of the Sophomores the Declaimers were likewise twelve in
		  number—Fabius H. Busbee of Raleigh, Augustus W. Graham of Hillsboro, Wm.
		  D. Horner of Granville Co., Isaac R. Strayhorn of Hillsboro, George G. Latta of
		  Tennessee, Wm. S. Pearson of Morganton, Edwin W. Fuller of Louisburg, Isaac H.
		  Foust Randolph Co., James W. Harper Lenoir Co., John Burgwyn McRae of Georgia,
		  afterwards North Carolina; William H. S. Burgwyn of Northampton, and Paul B.
		  Means, Cabarrus Co. The prize of public approval <pb xml:id="p753" n="753"/>was
		  given to Mr. Busbee. All became graduates except Fuller, Foust and McRae.
		  Fuller was a merchant in Louisburg, and author of a touching poem called Angel
		  in the Cloud, and a novel, Sea-Gift, much read by our University students, who
		  wrongly think that the incidents were drawn from actual happenings at this
		  University.</p>
          <p>The address of ex-Governor Z. B. Vance was worthy of that
		  distinguished man. It was the Annual Oration before the two Literary Societies,
		  on “The Duties of Defeat.” His counsels, like those of General Lee
		  on the same subject, were eminently wise and timely, a sincere acceptance of
		  the decisions of the war, loyalty to our governments, national and state,
		  faithful labor for the reconstruction of society, for the up-building of the
		  material interests of our people and the education of our children.</p>
          <p>There were only three Graduates, Abner H. Askew, Hertford, William C.
		  Rencher, Pittsboro, George Slover, Newbern.</p>
          <p>Of them, Askew and Slover were reputable physicians and Rencher a
		  lawyer and journalist.</p>
          <p>Of those who matriculated with the class were Julian Shakespeare Carr,
		  a wealthy manufacturer and banker, and a large benefactor of the University,
		  Joseph William Holden, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, and
		  Abraham K. Smedes, a Confederate soldier and a lawyer of great learning.</p>
          <p>The Latin Salutatory was spoken by Slover of New Berne. Askew's
		  address on the Latin phrase, <hi rend="italics">“<foreign xml:lang="lat">Quisque Suae Fortunae Faber</foreign>,”</hi>was in English.
		  The Valedictory fell to Rencher, and was delivered with much feeling and
		  grace.</p>
          <p>The degree of A.B. was conferred, <hi rend="italics">ex gratia,</hi>
		  on Charles J. Austin, Alexander Montague, Nathaniel K. Roan, Elias H. Bryan,
		  and William C. Jordan, whose course, nearly completed, was interrupted by the
		  war.</p>
          <p>The Marshals were eminently satisfactory. They were Robert W. Means,
		  William H. Reeves, of Tennessee, George M. Rose and John G. Young.</p>
          <p>Trustees present were Governor Jonathan Worth, ex-Governors Morehead
		  and Graham, Judge W. H. Battle, President Swain and State Treasurer, K. P.
		  Battle. There were also <pb xml:id="p754" n="754"/>the State Geologist, W. C. Kerr,
		  and General William R. Cox—State Solicitor and afterwards Judge.</p>
          <p>As showing the disruption of education caused by the war, I state
		  that, if Mr. Askew had continued in the class in which he began, he would have
		  graduated in 1863. Mr. Rencher similarly would have graduated in 1863. Mr.
		  Slover was the only representative of the Freshman class of 1862. In 1859
		  Rencher's class numbered 80, in 1861, 106; in 1862, 29, in 1863, 8.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on Andrew Johnson,
		  President of the United States, and Edwin G. Reade, Judge of the Supreme Court
		  of North Carolina. The degree of Doctor of Divinity on Rev. Numa F. Reid, of
		  the Methodist Church.</p>
          <p>In 1866 the troubles of the University thickened. The salaries of the
		  Faculty could not be paid. Having a young and growing family and unable to
		  support them without outside aid, Adjunct-Professor Pool obtained leave of
		  absence and accepted a position of Deputy Appraiser in the revenue service. A
		  stipulation was adopted by the Trustees that, when his service should expire,
		  they should not be bound to re-establish his chair.</p>
          <p>When the Trustees examined the wreck of the University to see what was
		  left the situation was appalling. The debts were $103,000, besides
		  $7,000 arrears of salaries. To pay these there were 2,000 shares of
		  worthless bank stock, $25,000 of equally worthless Confederate
		  securities, and a small amount of other securities, very little paying
		  interest. For a whole year the only receipt from this source was
		  $25.</p>
          <p>As the notes of our best banks were selling for 70 or 80 per cent
		  under par, it was thought to be a good plan to borrow money on mortgage of all
		  the University property, which was then thought to be legal, and buy notes of
		  the Bank of North Carolina and with them pay the large debt to the Bank.
		  President Swain was therefore instructed to visit “the North,” and
		  negotiate on this security a loan of $30,000. The President called on
		  John Jacob Astor, who declined to consider the proposition, stating that it was
		  his custom to accept as security only real estate in New York, and very seldom
		  outside the city. His reason was that it would be necessary to employ lawyers
		  acquainted <pb xml:id="p755" n="755"/>with the laws of the State where the
		  borrowers lived, and that would make the loan unprofitable. The President was
		  so discouraged that he made no further attempt.</p>
          <p>When preparations for Commencement were being made, President Swain
		  and his staff were thrown into uneasiness, almost a panic, on learning that the
		  Ball-Managers had selected as Honorary Managers some most conspicuous
		  Confederate leaders. This was done without consulting the great men so honored.
		  They were Jefferson Davis, General Wm. R. Cox, General J. C. Breckenridge,
		  General Robert D. Johnson, General R. E. Lee, Governor Z. B. Vance.</p>
          <p>The President laid the matter before the Trustees. They decided at
		  once that under present circumstances the selection of those recently
		  conspicuous in public affairs was likely to expose the University to undeserved
		  suspicion, and moreover it was grossly improper to place the name of any one as
		  a manager of a ball without previously obtaining his consent. It must be
		  remembered that Congress, which by excluding the Southern members, had a
		  two-thirds majority of Republicans, was then debating the action to be taken
		  with the Confederate States, and that the University is a public corporation.
		  Hostile legislation was feared.</p>
          <p>The dividends of the bank having ceased, there was a constant struggle
		  for money for necessary expenses, including salaries. The report of a Committee
		  to reduce the Bursar's compensation to $300 and that of the
		  Secretary-Treasurer to $500 was adopted.</p>
          <p>A plan of aiding the Faculty, though at the expense of the principal
		  of assets, was the issue of $7,300 of bonds, bearing eight per cent
		  interest, payable at the end of five years, secured by pledge of securities.
		  This was of signal benefit, but some of the more impecunious professors passed
		  them to merchants at a large discount.</p>
          <p>Messrs. B. F. Moore, Thomas Bragg and Daniel M. Barringer were
		  authorized to confer with the Bank of North Carolina, with the view of
		  compromising the debt of the University by reducing the amount to one-fourth
		  and giving a mortgage on its property in favor of all creditors. The bankrupt
		  law allowed no preferences.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p756" n="756"/>
          <p>Subsequently Mr. Moore reported the compromise, which was carried into
		  effect—on paper. The following are the terms: The debt was reduced to
		  $35,712.64 in national currency, at one dollar and thirty-four cents of
		  the same for one dollar in gold. The debts to Miss M. C. Cameron,
		  $10,000, to David L. Swain, $3,000, and other small debts, were
		  included. The plan in substance was for the University to pay twenty-five per
		  cent of its debt in gold and be discharged.</p>
          <p>As security all the University property at Chapel Hill and lands in
		  Buncombe County were pledged. The Trustees, Charles Manly and George W.
		  Mordecai, were to sell the property whenever called on by any creditor. It is
		  anticipating, but it seems best to state, that this mortgage was decided by the
		  Circuit Court of the United States to be void, as to such property as was
		  needed for the life of the University, as contradistinguished from endowment,
		  because it belonged to the State. This will be explained more fully in Volume
		  II of this history.</p>
          <p>At this time the General Assembly appropriated $7,000 to aid in
		  paying the officers of the institution, which was a welcome relief, although it
		  was only for one year.</p>
          <p>On February 11th, 1867, President Swain had the good fortune to
		  procure from the General Assembly the transfer of the State's right to the
		  Agricultural and Mechanical College Land Scrip under the Act of Congress of
		  July 2nd, 1862, often called the Morrill Act. The conditions demanded by the
		  General Assembly were: 1st, “The University shall comply with the Act of
		  Congress.</p>
          <p>2nd. The second condition was that the Trustees should dispose of the
		  scrip and establish at least two professorships, which should be especially
		  devoted to carry into effect the Act of Congress. In the second section the
		  words of the Act were fully quoted, “The leading object shall be, without
		  excluding other classical and scientific studies, and including Military
		  Tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to Agriculture and
		  the Mechanic Arts, in such manner as the General Assembly shall prescribe, in
		  order to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes
		  in the several pursuits and professions of life.”</p>
          <pb xml:id="p757" n="757"/>
          <p>The third provision was that each county court might send annually one
		  indigent student to the University free of tuition.</p>
          <p>And fourthly, that students might be admitted into the branches
		  relating to Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts without requiring the training
		  necessary for admission into the regular College courses.</p>
          <p>President Swain proceeded to Washington and applied for the transfer
		  of the scrip for 270,000 acres of land, <hi rend="italics">i. e.,</hi>30,000
		  acres for each Senator and Representative to whom this State was entitled.
		  Notwithstanding that Congress refused to regard the seceding States as restored
		  to their rights in the Union, President Johnson ordered the transfer to be
		  made. The Trustees determined to sell at once at the market price, then fifty
		  cents per acre for cash. Congress had suspended the location of scrip going to
		  Southern States, but G. F. Lewis, for himself and Fisher, Booth &amp; Co., of
		  Detroit, offered the following terms, which were accepted August 22nd, 1867,
		  viz.: They were to pay at the rate of fifty cents an acre for the 270,000
		  acres. The scrip was to be delivered as paid for and the rest was to be held as
		  security. $5,000 was to be paid in ten days. On or before the 1st of
		  March, 1868, $5,000 more was to be paid. Within sixty days after
		  Congress should rescind its resolution prohibiting the location of the scrip,
		  the purchasers were to pay $30,000 more, and from time to time make
		  further payments until the whole debt should be discharged within twelve months
		  from the date of the contract. The purchasers were not to be bound to pay more
		  than $10,000, unless Congress should rescind its resolution, and if this
		  was not done before the 5th of March, 1869, the contract should come to an
		  end.</p>
          <p>Ex-Governor Graham then moved that, as Congress authorized the
		  investment of ten per cent of the proceeds of the scrip in purchase of sites of
		  colleges and experimental farms, and as the University furnished the site,
		  $13,500 of the first purchase-money should be applied to general
		  expenses.</p>
          <p>And, secondly, that as the General Assembly had been prohibited by
		  military order from meeting, in consideration of the exigencies of the
		  Treasury, the Board deemed it necessary to act without the previous assent of
		  the Assembly and relies for <pb xml:id="p758" n="758"/>its ratification at the next
		  session of the Legislature. Both motions were adopted.</p>
          <p>The cash thus paid to the officers of the Institution relieved them of
		  painful straits. There was some criticism of Governor Graham's resolutions, as
		  not being good law, but practical men realized the necessity for such action.
		  As he said in its advocacy, public servants must sometimes take
		  responsibilities, and go beyond their instructions and trust that their action
		  will be approved by the proper authority. Afterwards, when Attorney E. G.
		  Haywood advised the Board, elected under the Reconstruction Acts of Congress,
		  that the Trustees, who passed the resolutions, could be forced to refund the
		  money, Chief Justice Pearson strongly advised that public officers acting in
		  good faith could not be held personally responsible in a case like this. His
		  advice was taken—no suit was brought.</p>
          <p>The Executive Committee adopted very feeling resolutions on the death
		  of Dr. James Phillips on the 14th of April, 1867. He was the Senior Professor,
		  the first to enter the Chapel and take his accustomed seat with his
		  recitation-room key and text-book for morning recitations in his hands. He died
		  almost instantly without a struggle or a groan in the very spot where often he
		  had risen to lead in the religious services of the Institution. The last sounds
		  in his ear were the familiar tones of the College Bell, the last object of
		  sight the Students Assembling for Prayers. On Wednesday night of the following
		  Commencement, Rev. Prof. A. D. Hepburn, afterwards D.D. and LL.D., gave a most
		  beautiful and truthful estimate of his life-work; for forty-one years Professor
		  of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy in the University. The discourse was
		  singularly felicitous in matter and manner, a worthy tribute to a learned
		  mathematician, an eloquent and Christ-loving divine, and a kind and generous
		  citizen. A Trustees remarked that in the same year, 1826, the road to Chapel
		  Hill saw Andrew Johnson going out to show the sons of North Carolina what they
		  could do and Professor Phillips coming in to show them what they ought to
		  do.</p>
          <p>At the beginning of 1867 we had nominally nine Professors, but
		  Assistant Professor Pool and the Tutors had indefinite leave of absence or had
		  resigned. Rev. Dr. Charles Phillips <pb xml:id="p759" n="759"/>was Secretary of the
		  Faculty and Professor Hubbard Librarian.</p>
          <p>In this year another President of the United States honored our
		  Commencement, Andrew Johnson of Tennessee. In reply to the speech of welcome by
		  President Swain, he told how forty-one years before he had left Raleigh, his
		  native town, and journeyed on foot by way of Chapel Hill to his newly chosen
		  home, how he walked over our main street weary and hungry and asked for food
		  and a night's lodging from kindly James Craig, who not only complied with his
		  request but gave the forlorn boy a bag full of bread and meat for his future
		  needs. His next visit to Chapel Hill was as President of this great Republic of
		  nearly forty million souls. The cabin which gave him shelter still stands.</p>
          <p>He was accompanied by his Secretary of State, Wm. H. Seward, and
		  Postmaster-General Alexander W. Randall, together with General Daniel E.
		  Sickles, who under the Reconstruction laws of Congress was Military Governor of
		  this State and our Southern neighbor; also by Colonel J. W. Bomford, and
		  General Avery, subordinate officers of General Sickles. The two most
		  distinguished visitors lodged with President Swain. They were all received and
		  treated with due respect and honor, and the reception speeches by them and by
		  President Swain were in unexceptionable taste.</p>
          <p>The Chapel resounded with the borrowed eloquence of twenty-four
		  declaimers. The Freshmen performed their duty on Monday night. They were, James
		  B. Yellowley, Greenville; Andrew M. Craig, Alamance County; Stephen W. Noble,
		  Lenoir County; Wm. Buchanan, Richmond County; James A. Smith, Robeson County;
		  Wilson J. McKay, Harnett County; J. Knox Livingston, Florida; Daniel A. Long,
		  Alamance County; William A. Shorter, Alabama; Reuben C. Shorter, Alabama;
		  Nelson M. Ferebee, Camden County; Quintus P. Siler, Alabama.</p>
          <p>On Wednesday eve came on the Sophomore Declaimers. They were, George
		  H. Estes, Georgia; Joseph C. Webb, Hillsboro; Willie H. Maverick, Texas; Edmund
		  Jones, Jr., Caldwell County; Peter M. Wilson, Warrenton; Platt D. Walker,
		  Wilmington; V. St. Clair McNider, North Carolina; Samuel T.
		  <pb xml:id="p760" n="760"/>Bitting, Surry County; William H. Bledsoe, Raleigh;
		  James M. Means, Concord; Alexander Graham, Cumberland; Charles F. McKesson,
		  Morganton.</p>
          <p>It was thought by many that more graceful Freshmen Speakers were
		  noticed than were among the Sophomores. Some good judges were of opinion that
		  Wilson of the latter and Buchanan of the former carried off the palm. Smith,
		  McKay, Livingston and Siler were praised by many. McNider had an uncommonly
		  graceful delivery which secured suffrages among the ladies. There was complaint
		  that old moss-backed fossils of speeches should be annually brought out, but
		  the criticism would have been more just during some former Commencements.</p>
          <p>Ex-Governor Henry A. Wise of Virginia had agreed to deliver the
		  Address before the two Literary Societies, but was forced to recall his
		  acceptance so late that a substitute could not be secured. Hence the
		  Baccalaureate sermon was preached on Wednesday morning.</p>
          <p>The preacher was Rev. James McDaniel, a Baptist preacher of high
		  reputation in charge at Fayetteville. His text was, “But one thing
		  needful.” The “one thing” is Moral Culture, which will save
		  us from the dangers of infidelity, from “the weakness of a falsely
		  balanced soul.” The music of this service was unique and very beautiful,
		  rendered by two male voices, those of Mr. Eugene Wilson and his brother
		  Charles, both accomplished vocalists, and teachers of singing.</p>
          <p>At night was the address by Dr. Hepburn on the Life and Character of
		  Dr. James Phillips, heretofore described.</p>
          <p>On Thursday the audience was imposing. On the stage were President
		  Johnson, Secretary Seward and Postmaster-General Randall, General Sickles,
		  Governor Worth, Judge Battle, President Swain, the Chaplain of the Day, Rev.
		  Dr. F. M. Hubbard, and the Senior orators.</p>
          <p>On the floor in front were Rev. Cushing B. Hassell, Messrs. Paul C.
		  Cameron, Francis E. Shober and Kemp P. Battle, Trustees, Colonel Bumford,
		  General Avery, and other officers of the United States Army, Colonel J. T.
		  Morehead, General Rufus Barringer, and other officers of the late Confederate
		  States, ex-Governor Clark and his associates, being the Legislative
		  <pb xml:id="p761" n="761"/>Committee to report on the state of the University. In
		  addition to these were famous teachers, lawyers, physicians, divines, and
		  others prominent in agricultural and other business pursuits.</p>
          <p>The following programme shows the exercises of the day:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, George M. Rose, Fayetteville.</p>
          <p>“Napoleon at St. Helena,” Willie Alston, Halifax
		  County.</p>
          <p>“The Athenian Republic,” William Henry Miller, Shelby.</p>
          <p>“The Achievements of Hannibal,” Albert G. Carr, Chapel
		  Hill.</p>
          <p>“The Love of Money,” Winfield S. Guthrie, Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>“Hopes and Disappointments of Life,” John Graham Young,
		  Charlotte.</p>
          <p>“The Pleasures of Memory,” Robert Work Means, Concord.</p>
          <p>“Civilization,” Wm. Hicks Reeves, Tennessee.</p>
          <p>“Emancipation,” James Billingslea Mitchell, Alabama.</p>
          <p>The Valedictory, Patrick Henry Winston, Windsor.</p>
          <p>Messrs. Reeves and Mitchell were excused from appearing, the former on
		  account of sickness, the latter from being detained at home by other duties.
		  The Salutatory was praised because it was well pronounced, not because it was
		  understood. The Valedictory had many encomiums. At its conclusion, Secretary
		  Seward, on behalf of Mr. Winston's father, presented him with an elegant gold
		  watch and chain for winning the first honor after a four years course.
		  President Johnson shook his hand and warmly congratulated him. The Senior class
		  numbered eleven, the same mentioned above with James M. Wall of Ansonville in
		  addition.</p>
          <p>Patrick H. Winston obtained the first honor, George M. Rose the
		  second, and Robert W. Means the third. Owing to the stormy times, Means was the
		  only Senior who attended all the examinations of the four years course.</p>
          <p>Winston reached the positions of Attorney-General and United States
		  District Attorney in the State of Washington; Rose was a Confederate regimental
		  Adjutant, Speaker of the State House of Representatives, and is a leading
		  lawyer; Means is a lawyer and has been Mayor of Concord and member of the
		  Legislature.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduates, Wm. W. Fleming was a Major, a
		  <pb xml:id="p762" n="762"/>member of the North Carolina Legislature, and successful
		  lawyer in New York City; James S. Battle, Aid to General Cox; State Senator,
		  Manufacturer, Trustee of the University; Wm. A. B. Branch, a Confederate
		  soldier, Representative in Congress and State Legislature; Andrew J. Burton,
		  Adjutant, strong lawyer, a leader in the Legislature.</p>
          <p>Both Societies held meetings for the initiation of honorary members.
		  The President joined the Dialectic Society and made a most appropriate informal
		  talk. Nearly all the members desired the admission of General Sickles, but a
		  small minority prevented it, which they had the power to do under the rules,
		  not for any personal objections but in order to emphasize their hostility to
		  the Reconstruction Acts. Secretary Seward, Postmaster-General Randall and
		  Colonel Bomford joined the Philanthropic Society. In the case of Seward there
		  was a reminder of an ancient political controversy. In the promise required of
		  each member was an expression something like “not divulging any matter
		  derogatory to the dignity of the Society.” The old New York champion of
		  the Anti-Masons stopped the proceeding, saying, “Mr. Secretary; I must
		  have that understood—I am principled against joining secret
		  societies.” Satisfactory assurances were given that certainly as to
		  honorary members, the Society did not come within the category of those which
		  he so valiantly fought, and he became a member. Both he and Randall spoke words
		  of kindness and wise suggestions.</p>
          <p>The eminent visitors as a rule showed kindly tact. There was one
		  exception. Mr. Seward, in conversation with gentlemen who called on him,
		  criticised the dwellings of Chapel Hill, saying that they reminded him of
		  Auburn, his home, sixty years ago. He should have remembered that the buildings
		  he saw had belonged to the University for many years, and such ancient
		  buildings are seldom improved, particularly under so economical a President as
		  Governor Swain. He should further have noted that six years had elapsed since
		  the great Civil War began, and not only the buildings had deteriorated but the
		  loss of the University endowment prevented their repair. They were not at all
		  fair representatives of dwellings in the towns and villages of the State even
		  at that unfortunate period. It <pb xml:id="p763" n="763"/>is not meant that Mr.
		  Seward intended to sneer at our poverty, but his comparisons were not
		  pleasant.</p>
          <p>The degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred on Wm. H. Seward, Secretary
		  of State, and that of Doctor of Divinity on Rev. Richard Hines, then of
		  Tennessee, of the Class of 1850.</p>
          <p>In the Fall of 1867, Mr. Charles Phillips took the place of his father
		  as Professor of Pure Mathematics, leaving the chair of Mixed Mathematics
		  vacant; Col. Wm. J. Martin resigned the chair of Chemistry, Mineralogy and
		  Geology; and Professor Hepburn resigned the chair of Metaphysics, Logic and
		  Rhetoric. The teaching force of the undergraduates was reduced to five,
		  counting the President. Even this could not shake his serene hopefulness, that
		  somehow the storm would pass away and the University ship sail on with
		  favorable winds.</p>
          <p>Colonel Martin was for awhile Professor in a school of high rank in
		  Columbia, Tennessee. He was thence transferred to Davidson College as Professor
		  of Chemistry, and conducted this department with great ability. For several
		  years he acted as President and was distinguished for his combined sagacity and
		  firmness. The strength of his brain and his knowledge in matters pertaining to
		  his department, corresponded with his lofty principles and kindly heart. He was
		  one of the most lovable men this State ever had.</p>
          <p>As the year 1867 progressed it became evident that the University was
		  on the verge of failure. On July 30th, Governor Worth, as President of the
		  Board of Trustees, called a meeting for the 22nd of August, and by special
		  letter urged each Trustee to attend and “share the responsibility of the
		  trust he had accepted.” He stated that there were three important
		  vacancies in the Professorships. President Swain had offered to resign,
		  “at the earliest period at which the Board may be pleased to designate a
		  successor.” All the endowment was lost. The University owed a large debt
		  for which all its property was mortgaged and there was no possibility of
		  redemption. The tuition fees would not pay adequate salaries. The noble
		  Institution must soon perish unless efficient measures for preserving its
		  existence be taken.</p>
          <p>Those present at this important meeting were: Governor Worth, Judge W.
		  H. Battle, and Messrs. K. P. Battle, D. M. <pb xml:id="p764" n="764"/>Barringer,
		  Thomas Bragg, Paul C. Cameron, Seaton Gales, William A. Graham, Charles Manly,
		  Montfort McGhee, Samuel F. Phillips, Thomas Ruffin, Francis E. Shober, Walter
		  L. Steele, Thomas Settle, David L. Swain.</p>
          <p>It was clear that neither Faculty nor mode of government nor
		  curriculum had the approval of the friends of the University. Mr. Kemp P.
		  Battle determined, as no one else seemed disposed to undertake the task, to
		  procure a complete remodelling of the Institution. In this he had the cordial
		  co-operation of Rev. Dr. Charles Phillips, Professor of Mathematics, who was
		  thoroughly conversant with the courses and government of the leading
		  institutions of America. Dr. Phillips procured the resignations of President
		  Swain and of Professors Hubbard, Fetter and Smith and of Judge Battle,
		  accompanying them with his own. Although the resolution of Congress prohibiting
		  the location of Southern Land Scrip prevented further payments by the
		  purchasers, it was not likely that this prohibition would be long continued,
		  and thus the University could be started with a larger infusion of scientific
		  teaching. It was the design to reopen the Institution with such changes as to
		  present a new front to the public, and thus get rid of prejudices which rightly
		  or wrongly impeded the popularity of the University. Although the teaching
		  force would be newly chosen, the Trustees in all probability would re-elect at
		  least part of the old staff. With this plan in view, Mr. Battle offered a
		  resolution which was adopted, reciting that, whereas, it is deemed expedient to
		  make thorough changes in the course of studies and mode of government of the
		  University, that increased facilities may be afforded for the acquisition of a
		  complete education, and that the standard of scholarship may be elevated,
		  Resolved, that a Committee of five report to the annual meeting the 10th of
		  December, 1867, a scheme, embodying as near as may be the “University or
		  Elective system,” with higher qualifications for admission and
		  graduation. The Board expressed deep regret at the severance of official
		  relations with the Faculty, and thanked them for past faithful conduct.</p>
          <p>The Committee appointed under the resolution were Wm. A. Graham,
		  Samuel F. Phillips, Kemp P. Battle, Thomas Settle, and Thomas S. Ashe.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p765" n="765"/>
          <p>Governor Worth departed from the usual custom and designated
		  ex-Governor Graham as Chairman, a post which was peremptorily declined, partly
		  because Governor Graham favored the old system, and partly because he insisted
		  that the Chairmanship belonged of right to the mover of the resolution. The
		  Governor readily acquiesced in this view.</p>
          <p>The Committee made a careful and exhaustive study of the subject,
		  obtaining valuable suggestions from President Swain, Rev. Dr. McGuffey Dr.
		  Woolsey, Messrs. Wm. Bingham and James H. Horner, and particularly from Prof.
		  John E. Minor, Dr. Charles Phillips, Profs. W. J. Martin and A. D. Hepburn. A
		  careful study of the catalogues of the leading Universities and Colleges was
		  also made.</p>
          <p>After discussing the features common to the two systems, known as the
		  Curriculum and University system, the Committee gave their idea of the latter.
		  The four years curriculum and the regular progression of classes are abandoned.
		  There are independent schools, each professor being supreme in his own
		  department, subject to the control of the Trustees, solely responsible for the
		  instruction and solely invested with the power of conferring degrees therein.
		  The majority of the Committee preferred this to the old system.</p>
          <p>1. Because it offers peculiar facilities for instruction in scientific
		  departments now too much neglected.</p>
          <p>2. The present curriculum is so crowded that it is impossible to teach
		  one branch thoroughly without crowding the others. For example, in our four
		  years course, Metaphysics, Logic, Rhetoric, English Language and Literature
		  have only 111 hours, or about thirty-seven days of three hours each. To Applied
		  Mathematics, including Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Electricity, Magnetism, etc.,
		  are given only 145 hours, or forty-eight days. The great sciences of Chemistry,
		  Mineralogy and Geology have only 244 hours or 81 days, while the Ancient
		  Languages have 740 hours, or 246 days, or one-third more than all combined.
		  Zoology, Botany, Physiology, etc., are not taught at all.</p>
          <p>3. The University system would be best for those having a limited time
		  for work and for those who are honestly resolved to make the most of their
		  time. It certainly makes the careless <pb xml:id="p766" n="766"/>and indolent no
		  worse, and it is possible that the liberty of election may result in arousing
		  the interest of even these in at least one department.</p>
          <p>Under the new system the University would have the opportunity of
		  paying a much smaller salary out of the University treasury and supplementing
		  it by allowing the Professors part or whole of the tuition money paid by his
		  students. One thousand dollars was thought to be reasonable as the amount to be
		  paid out of the University Treasury. It was suggested, too, that the Professors
		  should have a concurrent vote with the Trustees.</p>
          <p>The Committee are fully impressed with the advantages of the Classics
		  and Mathematics as trainers of the mind. They believe, however, that sufficient
		  time can be found to secure this result without neglecting as at present other
		  studies.</p>
          <p>The Committee think that a proper construction of the Constitution
		  requires that the University should hold a superiority above all similar
		  institutions in the State. Hence there should be loftier standards of
		  admission, and diplomas should be evidences of solid attainments. When the
		  honors of the institution are granted to ignorant men, either the degree is
		  worthless, or the reputation of the grantor is injured, or the public are
		  deceived. So the examinations at the close of each term should be stringent and
		  have much weight in estimating the standards of students.</p>
          <p>The Committee recommend the following Academic Departments, leaving
		  those of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, of Law and of Medicine to be
		  reported on hereafter.</p>
          <p>1. School of Political Science, including Political Economy and
		  History.</p>
          <p>2. School of Latin Language and Literature.</p>
          <p>3. School of Greek Language and Literature.</p>
          <p>4. School of Pure Mathematics, including Mechanics.</p>
          <p>5. School of Physics, including Astronomy.</p>
          <p>6. School of Metaphysics and Ethics.</p>
          <p>7. School of Rhetoric and English Language and Literature.</p>
          <p>8. School of Chemistry and Mineralogy.</p>
          <p>9. School of Geognosy, including Geology, Geography and the
		  inhabitants of the earth, vegetable and animal.</p>
          <p>10. School of Modern Languages.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p767" n="767"/>
          <p>The report of the Committee, to which ex-Governor Graham dissented,
		  was adopted by a vote of 18 to 3. The election of the Professors was left to a
		  future meeting, the Faculty in the meantime retaining their chairs by request.
		  It was resolved to put the new scheme into operation at the beginning of the
		  Fall Term, 1868. On the 16th of March, 1868, a new State Constitution was
		  adopted under the Reconstruction laws of Congress. By its provisions the Board
		  of Trustees was to give way to new members elected, not by the General
		  Assembly, but by the Board of Education. As the University was to go into new
		  hands, the Trustees at the Commencement of that year, reappointed President
		  Swain and his Professors and rescinded the resolution to put the new scheme
		  into operation.</p>
          <p>It was the expectation of the promoters of the new scheme that
		  vigorous efforts should be made to obtain contributions from the General
		  Assembly and from the Alumni and friends of the University, and also a canvass
		  made for new students. It was not likely that payments of the interest of the
		  Land Grant fund would be long deferred, and, on the whole, with energy the
		  execution of the plan seemed quite hopeful. Seven years afterward the Chairman
		  of the Committee on the subject, almost altogether by correspondence, in a few
		  weeks procured $20,000 in subscriptions for the revival of the
		  institution. It is reasonable that similar liberality existed in 1868 which
		  would have brought good fruit, if new men, who had not the sympathy of the
		  Alumni generally, had not displaced the old authorities.</p>
          <p>We have come to the last Commencement of the old Regime, that of 1868.
		  After that event these occasions, though like the old somewhat in form, were in
		  principle essentially different. The old University became moribund in that
		  year.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday morning President Swain examined the Senior class, in the
		  presence of the Examining Committee, on Constitutional Law and the Law of
		  Nations. The Societies then had a meeting for the initiation of new members. At
		  night six Freshmen Declaimers competed for the favor of the audience. They were
		  Samuel L. Patterson of Caldwell County, W. Plummer Batchelor of Raleigh, Samuel
		  M. Davidson of Charlotte, Andrew J. Britton of Northampton County, John K.
		  Gibson <pb xml:id="p768" n="768"/>of Richmond County, Robert A. Johnston of
		  Richmond County. Messrs. Britton and Gibson received the verdict of the most
		  careful critics.</p>
          <p>The Sophomore Declaimers, twelve in number, appeared the ensuing
		  night. They were W. James McKay of Harnett, Henry M. Shaw of Currituck, Wm.
		  Buchanan of Richmond County, George T. Winston of Windsor, Reuben C. Shorter of
		  Alabama, John W. Philips of Edgecombe County, Charles E. French of Wilmington,
		  Edgar Leary of Oxford, Charles A. Reynolds of Leaksville, Nelson M. Ferebee of
		  Camden County, Joseph K. Rankin of Lenoir, James B. Yellowley of
		  Greenville.</p>
          <p>While there was general concurrence in the opinion of Governor Seymour
		  that the speakers of both classes showed a high degree of propriety of diction
		  and grace in delivery, Messrs. McKay, Buchanan, Winston, French, Leary and
		  Ferebee seemed to be especially praised.</p>
          <p>The oration before the two Societies was by Hon. Thomas H. Seymour,
		  late Governor of Connecticut. He was introduced most felicitously to the
		  audience by Mr. Fabius H. Busbee, and gave a thoughtful and statesmanlike essay
		  on “Government, its Origin and Forms, together with its Functions and
		  Dangers.”</p>
          <p>In the afternoon was the Baccalaureate sermon by Rev. Dr. R. S. Moran,
		  of the North Carolina Conference. By men acquainted with metaphysical
		  speculations it was emphatically praised, but it went far above the heads of
		  most of the audience. A correspondent wrote that it was a subtle, broad and
		  deep generalization, along the lines laid down by Sir Wm. Hamilton, of the
		  dealings of God with His creatures. The mythology of the heathen, the
		  philosophy of the Greeks, the legal instincts of the Romans, the speculations
		  of the schoolmen, the discoveries of science, re-echo Jewish types, that it is
		  the plan of the Almighty to reconcile all things to Himself through Christ.</p>
          <p>The speeches of the Seniors were of a high order, exhibiting an
		  uncommon maturity of intellect. The following is the programme:</p>
          <p>Latin Salutatory, Wm. H. S. Burgwyn, Northampton County.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p769" n="769"/>
          <p>“Thoughts, not Swords, Rule the World,” Charles Fetter,
		  Chapel Hill.</p>
          <p>“<foreign xml:lang="lat">Pro Patria</foreign>,” Eugene
		  Morehead, Greensboro.</p>
          <p>“Andrew Jackson,” W. Clarence Jones, Alabama.</p>
          <p>“Peter the Great,” Augustus W. Graham, Hillsboro.</p>
          <p>“Effects of the Reformation,” Wm. D. Horner, Granville
		  County.</p>
          <p>“Orange County,” Ike R. Strayhorn, Hillsboro.</p>
          <p>“<foreign xml:lang="ger">Die Macht der Musik</foreign>,”
		  (German Oration), James W. Harper, Lenoir County.</p>
          <p>“Poland,” Paul Barringer Means, Cabarrus County.</p>
          <p>“Constitution of the Union,” Wm. S. Pearson,
		  Morganton.</p>
          <p>Valedictory Oration, Fabius Haywood Busbee, Raleigh.</p>
          <p>It was universally agreed that the Latin speech was pronounced with
		  singular propriety, and that the Valedictory overflowed with sound sense and
		  pathos. The twenty graduates had among them representatives from seven
		  different classes, the earliest dating 1858, and the last 1864. Only one of
		  these, J. A. Watson, was present at the eight examinations of the four years
		  course. Mr. Busbee took highest honor at eight examinations, though two of them
		  were not of the Freshman class of 1864.</p>
          <p>The degree of A.B. <hi rend="italics">honoris causa,</hi>was granted
		  to W. N. Mebane and Lorenzo A. T. Jobe, former students, then teachers of
		  Classical Schools. Mebane became a Judge and Jobe a preacher in Kansas.</p>
          <p>The degree of A.M. was given <hi rend="italics">honoris causa</hi>to
		  E. Burke Haywood, M.D., of Raleigh, and to William S. Pettigrew, Esq., of
		  Tyrrell County.</p>
          <p>The degree of D.D. was conferred on Rev. Charles Phillips, Professor
		  of Mathematics in the University, Rev. Thomas H. Pritchard of Raleigh, and Rev.
		  A. A. Watson of Wilmington, since Bishop.</p>
          <p>The degree of L.L.D. was granted to ex-Governor Seymour, and Hon.
		  Bartholomew F. Moore, of Raleigh, a lawyer of profound learning and a wise and
		  active Alumnus and Trustee of the University. He graduated in 1820.</p>
          <p>The first honor in the Senior class was awarded to Messrs. W. H. S.
		  Burgwyn, F. H. Busbee and Eugene L. Morehead. <pb xml:id="p770" n="770"/>A
		  distinction, however, was made by giving Mr. Busbee the Valedictory. The second
		  distinction went to James W. Harper, Wm. S. Pearson and Augustus W. Graham, in
		  the order of their names. The third to Charles Fetter, Wm. D. Horner, Edmund
		  Jones junior, Paul Barringer Means, and Isaac R. Strayhorn.</p>
          <p>The Faculty, in their report, declared that in years, maturity of
		  intellect and extent of attainments, the class was above the average of its
		  predecessors. This is not surprising when we remember that nearly all of its
		  members had been doing the work of men in most trying times, either in the
		  tented field or in civil life.</p>
          <p>Of the Senior first honor men, Busbee has been a Confederate
		  Lieutenant, United States District Attorney, Presidential Elector, and is
		  Trustee of the University, an eminent lawyer, and a law author. Burgwyn was a
		  Captain C. S. A., L.L.B. of Harvard, author of the Maryland Digest, and is a
		  Trustee of the University, a lawyer and President of a Bank. Morehead was a
		  Confederate soldier and then a prominent banker, dying much lamented in middle
		  age.</p>
          <p>Of the second honor men, Harper was a lawyer and editor; Pearson,
		  Consul at Palermo, an editor, author, and is a lawyer; Graham was a Confederate
		  soldier, member of the Legislature and Judge of the Superior Court.</p>
          <p>Of the third honor men, Fetter was a classical teacher and is an
		  Episcopal minister; Horner . . . . .; Jones has been a Confederate soldier, a
		  member of the Legislature and Trustee of the University, a leader of the bar:
		  Means was Aid to General Rufus Barringer, State Senator, and Colonel on
		  Governor Vance's staff, and is now an attorney of the Southern Railroad and a
		  Trustee of the University; Strayhorn was a lawyer and State Solicitor.</p>
          <p>Of those who did not obtain an honor, George G. Latta was a member of
		  the Arkansas Legislature, of the Conventions of 1872, 1874 and 1876, and
		  Prosecuting Attorney; Thomas A. McNeill was a Judge of the Superior Court.</p>
          <p>Of the non-graduating matriculates, Warren G. Elliot was President of
		  the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company; George G. Thomas, Chief Physician of
		  the Atlantic Coast Line <pb xml:id="p771" n="771"/>Railroad Company and President
		  of the State Medical Society.</p>
          <p>For the first and only time the Marshals were from the Senior class,
		  Eugene L. Morehead, Chief, and James W. Harper, George W. Graham and Isaac R.
		  Strayhorn, assistants. No adverse criticism could be made as to their
		  efficiency.</p>
          <p>As the students in the classes below the Seniors never returned on
		  account of the closing of the institution, I give the honor men.</p>
          <p>There were eighteen Juniors. Franklin Porter of Tarboro and John M.
		  Webb of Alamance were first in scholarship; Alexander Graham of Fayetteville,
		  William E. Murchison of Harnett County, and John M. Rose, Jr., of Fayetteville,
		  were second, and Samuel T. Bitting of Mt. Airy was third. George V. Cowper of
		  Hertford was first in all studies but Mathematics.</p>
          <p>Of these first honor men, Porter is a good lawyer in Missouri, and
		  Webb is one of the Principals of the excellent Bellbuckle School in Tennessee.
		  Of the second honor men, Graham was in the Confederate army, and is
		  Superintendent of the City Graded Schools of Charlotte; Murchison was a lawyer
		  and merchant; Rose a prominent Presbyterian minister. Bitting, the third honor
		  man, is a merchant in Texas, and Cowper, distinguished in all but Mathematics,
		  is a lawyer of good practice.</p>
          <p>Of the Juniors who obtained no honors, John W. Fries is a very
		  prominent manufacturer, financier, and Trustee of the University.</p>
          <p>Among the thirty-five Sophomores, the first in scholarship were Jacob
		  Battle of Edgecombe, Ralph H. Graves, Jr., of Granville, Richard H. Lewis of
		  Tarboro. The second were Wm. Buchanan of Richmond and Edgar Leary of Oxford.
		  The third honor men were Charles E. French of Wilmington, Alexander Malloy of
		  Richmond County, and John D. Sloan of Alabama. George T. Winston was first in
		  all but Mathematics. Thompson Anderson of Nashville, Tennessee, and Edward O.
		  Lindsay of Greensboro were second in all but Mathematics. James B. Yellowley
		  was third in one of his studies and second in all the others.</p>
          <p>Of the foregoing, Battle is a learned lawyer, ex-Judge and State
		  Senator. Graves was Professor of Mathematics and <pb xml:id="p772" n="772"/>Civil
		  Engineering in the University of North Carolina, one of the ablest the South
		  has seen. Lewis is an eminent specialist, viz., oculist and aurist, author of
		  many valuable medical papers, written for the Board of Health of which he is
		  Secretary.</p>
          <p>Of those of the second rank, Buchanan is a prosperous lawyer and
		  member of the Legislature of Mississippi; Leary died early.</p>
          <p>Of the third honor men, French is a flour manufacturer in Minnesota,
		  Malloy is a highly respected planter, Sloan was a teacher in Alabama. Winston
		  was the accomplished Professor of Latin and German, and then of Latin only, in
		  this University, and was afterwards successively President of the University of
		  North Carolina, of the University of Texas, and now of the Agricultural and
		  Mechanical College of this State.</p>
          <p>Of those not gaining honors, Charles Alston Cook was State Senator and
		  Supreme Court Judge, now a lawyer in the Indian Territory; Daniel A. Long, a
		  Doctor of Divinity and of Laws, and once President of Antioch College, Ohio;
		  Richard H. Speight is a physician, and Trustee of the Central Hospital for the
		  Insane and was State Senator; Charles A. Reynolds was Lieutenant-Governor, and
		  is Postmaster of Winston-Salem.</p>
          <p>Of those who once belonged to the class, Platt D. Walker is a Supreme
		  Court Judge; Willie H. Maverick joined the army and is now a lawyer, banker and
		  real estate broker in Texas; Blair Burwell, a merchant and surveyor in
		  Colorado; James M. Means, a prominent railroad officer in the same State;
		  Alfred T. Alston, a planter and merchant; Joseph C. Webb, a merchant; Peter M.
		  Wilson, Assistant Clerk of the United States Senate; Edmund Jones, junior, a
		  lawyer, a Confederate soldier, an Assemblyman; V. St. Clair McNider, a
		  physician in Texas; Alonzo Phillips, a merchant in Chicago.</p>
          <p>Of the Freshmen of 1868, Andrew J. Britton won the first honor; is a
		  lawyer; James T. Crocker, one of the second, was a Lieutenant, and is a lawyer
		  and journalist; Samuel M. Davidson, another second, a teacher; John K. Gibson,
		  also a second, a lawyer and member of the Legislature in Arkansas. Of the third
		  rank, Robert A. Johnston was a Civil Engineer and is a lawyer. Vinson died
		  early.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p773" n="773"/>
          <p>Of those not competing for honors, Samuel L. Patterson was a member of
		  the Legislature and is Commissioner of the Board of Agriculture; Hannis Taylor
		  is author of a work of great merit on the Constitutional Law of England, was
		  Minister to Spain. Wm. Plummer Batchelor was for years Chief Clerk under the
		  Secretary of State.</p>
          <p>Of the matriculates with the class, Melville E. Carter was a Captain,
		  a leader of the bar and in the General Assembly.</p>
          <p>I give a statement of the annual expenses, as estimated by the
		  Faculty, before, during and after the Civil War. The annual expenses in 1833
		  were stated to be $138, not including fuel and candles; in 1840,
		  $178, including those items. In 1850 they were about the same. In 1859,
		  $237. At these dates the tuition was $30, $50, $50,
		  $60. At the same dates the board was $60 to $80, R74 to
		  $102, $84 to $92, $100 to $140. It is
		  noticeable that in 1840 and 1850 fuel (wood) does not vary, $5 per
		  annum, and in 1859 only $5.50 yearly.</p>
          <p>The list of expenses does not include clothing, pocket-money and
		  Society fees. Nor does it include text-books, which during the whole period of
		  twenty-six years, are priced at $60 to $70 for four years, an
		  average of $15 to $17.50 for one year. The Faculty, in 1837,
		  dreading the effects of the great panic, sent out circulars stating that in
		  their opinion, exclusive of clothing, the expenses of students should not
		  exceed $250 per annum. This estimate was adhered to until 1856, when the
		  statement was that with the exception of clothing and traveling expenses, the
		  student should not spend over $300 per annum. The next year this was
		  raised to $325, which was adhered to until the third year of the Civil
		  War, when it was deemed impossible to name a limit in Confederate dollars.</p>
          <p>The expenses of the University, expressed in Confederate currency,
		  apparently increased. There was little increase of tuition and salaries of
		  officers even in that currency. In 1861 the expenses averaged $237 as in
		  1859; in 1862 the same. In 1863 the optimistic statements of the President were
		  forced to succumb. The usual expenses were stated at $459 and no
		  estimate of the total expenses was made. Board was stated at $250 to
		  $400 per annum. The next year the Faculty acknowledged themselves unable
		  to predict prices of board, bed, <pb xml:id="p774" n="774"/>lights, etc., but
		  promise to keep them within reasonable limits. There was the same omission in
		  1865, but in 1866, after the war, in United States currency, the general
		  expenses are set down at $207.50, and text-books at $40 to
		  $50. In 1867 the first item was placed still lower, $183.50, and
		  was lower still in 1867-'8, $164.50. Board in the latter year is
		  $60 to $75 per annum, a sad indication of the poverty of our
		  villagers and the desire to regain the streams of money which flowed into
		  Chapel Hill when students were numbered by hundreds, nearly all of prosperous
		  families.</p>

          <head>RECONSTRUCTION.</head>
          <p>The passing of the Reconstruction Acts in March, 1867, the
		  contemplated destruction of the State government inaugurated under President
		  Johnson, the subjecting the State to the control of a General of the army,
		  naturally impaired the confidence of the people in the prosperity of State
		  institutions. This was shown in the attendance of students at the University.
		  In the Fall of 1867 only 13 Freshmen appeared, as against 34 the preceding
		  year. There was widespread uneasiness about the future. Very few shared in the
		  vain belief of Mississippi and Georgia, that the Federal Supreme Court would
		  declare the Reconstruction Acts unconstitutional. On the 14th of January, 1868,
		  a Convention, by order of General Canby, met to form a new constitution for
		  this State. On the 16th of March the instrument was adopted, submitted on the
		  21st, 22nd and 23rd of April to the voters prescribed by Congress, and
		  adopted.</p>
          <p>A radical change in the government of the University was made by this
		  Constitution. It was placed in charge of a new Board of Trustees, to be elected
		  by the Board of Education. The Governor was to be Chairman both of the Board of
		  Trustees and of the Executive Committee, which was the real governing power.
		  The Board of Education, together with three appointed by the Board of Trustees,
		  and the President of the University, constituted this committee.</p>
          <p>When the names of the new Trustees were announced, it was seen that
		  there was careful elimination of all who had been in the past active in the
		  management of the University. Out of 78 new Trustees, only four belonged to the
		  old Board, and not <pb xml:id="p775" n="775"/>one of these four had been regular
		  and constant on the meetings of the Board and exercises of the institution,
		  whereas all those intimately identified with the institution, some of them for
		  years, were omitted. There were 18 alumni out of the 78, but of the remaining
		  60 only a handfull had ever seen Chapel Hill or shown any interest in the
		  University. It was clearly understood, even in advance of official action, that
		  the old professors would be turned off and the doors would be reopened with new
		  men to compose the Faculty. Of course there were many who were opposed to this
		  complete breaking with the past. Naturally the old patrons and friends were
		  displeased. Naturally they began to look out for other institutions where their
		  sons could obtain higher education. Notwithstanding these adverse influences.
		  President Swain never lost hope. This hope was ripened into realization, as he
		  thought, when he read the Constitution of 1868. I never saw him in finer
		  spirits than when he started to attend, by invitation, the first meeting of the
		  new Board of Trustees.</p>
          <p>Circumstances seemed to point him out as the proper successor of
		  himself. He had for years abstained from active partisanship, so that he was
		  not obnoxious for party reasons. The Republican General, Sherman, showed him
		  marked attention, furnishing him a team and presenting the horse as a gift.
		  President Johnson invited him, together with Wm. Eaton, B. F. Moore, R. P.
		  Dick, W. W. Holden, perhaps others, to Washington to become his advisers as to
		  the rehabilitation of the State government. His daughter had married a
		  prominent Republican General of great influence as a politician and editor of
		  an able journal. And lastly, not a word had been spoken in the Convention of
		  1868, showing any intention to change the President.</p>
          <p>All these considerations indicated that he would be continued by the
		  new Board as head of the University with opportunity to renew its
		  prosperity.</p>
          <p>The first meeting of the Trustees of the Reconstruction was on July
		  23rd, 1868. Secretary-Treasurer Manly was present by invitation and submitted
		  his report—very full and accurate—for which he was courteously, and
		  evidently not perfunctorily, thanked. I give the peroration of his report, the
		  <pb xml:id="p776" n="776"/>parting words of an officer who had grown gray in the
		  service of the University.</p>
          <p>“In conclusion I may be allowed an old man's privilege and say
		  that I took leave of those books and papers with deep and unaffected pain. They
		  appear to be the friends and associates of fifty years of the better part of my
		  manhood. They awaken days that are gone, they recall scenes and incidents
		  connected with many of the most eminent men of the State and they form a page
		  in the annals of North Carolina, unstained and ineffaceable. In them you may
		  trace the financial history of the Institution through perils, tribulations and
		  poverty, and see how through the patriotic exertions of her Trustees her
		  finances and means were improved and enlarged until she was raised to a
		  condition of ease and affluence.”</p>
          <p>“Here you may mark her honorable
		  <ref xml:id="ref29" target="#n47">1</ref>
		  <note xml:id="n47" anchored="true" target="#ref29">1 Governor Manly made a slip here. University instruction was
				given from the beginning. There was a grammar school in addition.</note>beginning as a Grammar school, may trace her gradual but steady growth in
		  reputation and influence, till through the noble and sustained efforts of her
		  first President, Joseph Caldwell, and the still more extended and successful
		  policy of her last President, David L. Swain, and the unremitting labor of her
		  noble band of professors and teachers, she became the just pride of the State,
		  distinguished among the most elevated institutions of the whole country. Here
		  we see the scholastic footsteps of her thousand young men, pursuing the
		  curriculum to the final goal of their Collegiate course. When leaving her
		  academic grove her Alumni have gone forth to fill and adorn the highest places
		  in the Nation. They fill the pulpit and Bar and Bench and National Councils.
		  You will find them in the highest offices in the gift of the American people,
		  Governors, Senators, Ministers abroad and in the Cabinet at home, and in the
		  Presidential Chair.” </p>
          <p>“God grant that her sun may never set! that under your
		  government her effulgence may grow bright and that her usefulness may increase
		  more and more throughout all time!”</p>
          <p>Ex-Governor Manly graduated fifty-four years before this, was
		  Secretary-Treasurer from 1821 and Trustee since 1826. Losing the office was a
		  cruel blow, especially as his income had been greatly reduced by the
		  emancipation of his slaves. <pb xml:id="p777" n="777"/>He had by nature a very
		  bright mind, but was too unambitious to become great. His declamation was
		  graceful and impressive; his manners agreeable and courteous. His mind abounded
		  in humorous and instructive reminiscences, which he narrated most
		  interestingly. He was always a welcome visitor at Commencements, from which he
		  was never absent except from sickness. He died May 1, 1871, from a painful
		  disease, gangrene in the feet.</p>
          <p>President Swain attended the same meeting also by invitation. He had
		  studied the new constitution and concluded that the clause making the Board of
		  Education and President of the University <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi>
		  Trustees and members of the Executive Committee, was a constitutional
		  recognition of himself as President. He fully believed that the new Board
		  invited his presence as the head of the institution, to receive his aid in
		  starting and running the new machinery. According to his view his participation
		  in the meeting was not as an invited guest, but as a member of the Board. It
		  was on his motion as such member that the report of the Secretary-Treasurer was
		  read.</p>
          <p>No notice was then given him that his place was considered vacant, but
		  the next day at a meeting held in his absence the Board declared his
		  resignation and those of the Professors in 1867 final, ignoring the re-election
		  by the former Board on June 4th, 1868. Of course the usual thanks for past
		  faithful services were given.</p>
          <p>The ex-President was profoundly astonished and shocked. It was a
		  pathetic sight—this venerable man, full of years and honors, who had held
		  high places in the executive, legislative and judicial departments of the
		  State, who for over one-third of a century had charge of its chief institution
		  of learning, who had influenced for good thousands of the leaders of the people
		  in public and private life, so saturated with love of the University that he
		  sought to control her even in her desolation, under new and untried guardians,
		  but by them coldly and without explanation turned away.</p>
          <p>When President Swain heard of the action of the Board on July 24th, he
		  was at Chapel Hill. On August 4th he addressed a protest to Governor Holden, as
		  Chairman of the Board of Trustees. He began by reciting the low state of the
		  institution at the death of Dr. Caldwell, and then showed how steadily it
		  <pb xml:id="p778" n="778"/>improved under his own management. It had numbers, he
		  said, greater, with a single exception, than were at any similar institution in
		  the United States. The net earnings in twenty-five years added a hundred
		  thousand dollars to the cash endowment and permanent improvements.</p>
          <p>The transfer to the University of the Agricultural and Mechanical Land
		  Scrip gave, he thought, reasonable hope of incidental aid to be derived from
		  this fund, but this hope was defeated by the action of Congress, postponing the
		  enjoyment of the grant.</p>
          <p>At no previous period, he insisted, had his labors been more zealous,
		  faithful and unintermitting. When he tendered his resignation in 1867, the
		  Board thanked him for his long, successful and eminent services and requested
		  him to continue in office until the following Commencement, when his successor
		  would be elected. When that time came the Board felt obliged to continue him in
		  the government of the University in order that its property should be cared
		  for, and assurance was given to the public that the doors would be re-opened at
		  the usual time. They therefore re-elected him and other members of the
		  Faculty.</p>
          <p>The Charter of 1789 gives the Board power to remove the President,
		  Professors and Tutors for “misbehavior, inability or neglect of
		  duty.” No such charges had been made against him and he was unwilling to
		  suppose that the resolution for accepting the resignation of 1867 was passed
		  with due consideration. He desired in no spirit of captiousness, but with an
		  earnest desire for the prosperity of the University and with a proper degree of
		  self-respect, to solicit a reconsideration.</p>
          <p>It can hardly be contended, he argued further, that a resignation
		  accepted by a Board which has ceased to exist, could be resurrected and
		  accepted by a Board which came into existence long afterwards. Still less can
		  such tender and acceptance be valid to declare the chair of the President
		  vacant, who is by the Constitution an integral part of the Executive
		  Committee.</p>
          <p>Doubtless it was the position of the new Board that prior to June 4th,
		  1868, the new State constitution had gone into operation, namely, on the 16th
		  of March, and that, while it was proper that the old Board of Trustees, as de
		  facto officers, <pb xml:id="p779" n="779"/>should care for the property and for the
		  ordinary exercises, it had no authority to elect officers to take permanent
		  charge of the institution after they had notice that they would be superseded
		  in office. His claim that, because the Constitution ordained that the President
		  should be a member of the Executive Committee, it was a recognition of himself
		  as such President, was not thought tenable, but the new Board published no
		  justification of their action.</p>
          <p>As corroborating the statements made by President Swain in his
		  protest, I give the following estimates made by Secretary and Treasurer Manly
		  at his request, and submitted as an exhibit.</p>

          <p>It is not probable that the President would have sought by an action
		  of mandamus to enforce his recognition. Before the Trustees met according to
		  adjournment his long and brilliant career had come to a tragic end. Having lent
		  money on mortgage of a plantation about six miles from Chapel Hill, called
		  Babylon, he was forced to purchase it. On the 11th of August, in company with
		  Professor Fetter, in a buggy drawn by the spirited horse, which General Sherman
		  had given him, <pb xml:id="p780" n="780"/>he rode out to inspect his farming
		  operations. On their return the animal made a wild dash. Mr. Fetter was the
		  driver, and probably could have controlled him; but the President, being of
		  nervous temperament, made an effort to seize the reins. The result was the
		  crushing of a wheel on a roadside stump and throwing both occupants of the
		  vehicle violently to the ground. Mr. Fetter's recovery was rapid, but President
		  Swain received such a nervous shock that he could not rally. His wounds healed
		  rapidly, but his physical weakness continued, although his spirits seemed good.
		  At last on the 29th he felt strong enough to sit up for an hour, but on lying
		  down he soon passed away. His last words were whispered mutterings, indicating
		  physical suffering. He was buried in his garden by the grave of his daughter
		  Annie and son David. His funeral sermon was preached by one of his intimate
		  friends, Rev. Dr. Charles Phillips of the Presbyterian Church. In his sickness
		  he gave assurance of faith in the Christian religion. His wife who loved him
		  with touching devotion, caused the bodies of him and his children to be removed
		  to Oakwood Cemetery at Raleigh and erected over them a monument of rare beauty,
		  of Scotch Granite.</p>
          <p>I have heretofore at some length considered the character of President
		  Swain. I think it can not be denied that according to modern standards he was
		  lacking some essentials of a great College President. He did not, like Elliott,
		  direct the streams of public or private generosity to the University. I have
		  already shown that he bought no books, and provided no apparatus for scientific
		  instruction. He seemed not to strive for the extension of the University's
		  reputation in the literary and scientific world. In his carefully drawn paper
		  of resignation, 1867, and which he repeats in his protest to the new Board in
		  July, 1868, evidently intended as a summary of the results of the achievements
		  of his Presidency, he mentions nothing but the increase of numbers, of
		  endowment by saving from income, and of buildings.</p>
          <p>What can be said in favor of his policy of increasing numbers and
		  buildings? of granting diplomas without requiring proficiency in studies?
		  Undoubtedly that he gave what the public demanded. The estimate of the success
		  of the University was measured by numbers. Governor Swain's policy coincided
		  <pb xml:id="p781" n="781"/>with public opinion. The usual question about the
		  success of the University was “how many boys have you?” Even at
		  this late day the boast of her friends is that in the year before the war the
		  Catalogue showed nearly five hundred names, and that her sons won wonderful
		  success after leaving the institution.</p>
          <p>The University of old times admirably supplied the public demand in
		  the South. This was not for scientific specialists, or for scholars in history,
		  literature or philosophy, but for men belonging to the so-called
		  “professions,” law, medicine, teaching and, I will not say
		  theology, but preaching. This was recognized in a curious University law, that
		  the degree of Master of Arts, Artium Magister (A.M), could be had for the
		  asking by any alumnus, who, after graduation, pursued for three years either of
		  these “learned” professions. President Swain shocked the old time
		  men by inducing the Faculty to give the degree to a successful merchant. The
		  course of Dr. Mitchell in scattering his energies over many branches was caused
		  not only by his personal tastes, but by want of appreciation by the people of
		  specialists. The same statement could be made of Dr. Charles Phillips, a man of
		  extraordinary talent in mathematics and energy of character.</p>
          <p>No one was deceived as to the value of diplomas, and the sonorous
		  assertions therein of profound learning in literature and the sciences. The
		  list of those who had obtained honors by hard study was read from the Chapel
		  rostrum and published in the newspapers. The public looked to this as showing
		  who had done honest and successful work in the class-room. And many a youth who
		  neglected his classics and mathematics became afterward a leader in the walks
		  of life.</p>
          <p>The University diploma, while it did not, unless accompanied by an
		  honor, prove scholarship, yet was of great value. Its possessor in this little
		  world had learned much that gave him an advantage over his neighbors not
		  blessed as he was. He had learned human nature and how to manage men. He had
		  learned to a considerable extent polished manners. He could think and speak on
		  his feet. In county meetings he knew rules of order and how to conduct
		  business. He had confidence in himself, and realized that he secures the fruit
		  who has boldness to seize it and to hold it with tenacious grasp. He saw that
		  his neighbors expected much of him and his self-respect <pb xml:id="p782" n="782"/>
		  forced him not to disappoint them, on the principle “noblesse
		  oblige.”</p>
          <p>A serious difficulty in the way of being strict in granting diplomas
		  lay in the want of preparatory schools. There were excellent institutions of
		  this sort, but large numbers of those desiring University education could not
		  from poverty or other reason attend them. There were many counties where
		  preliminary education could not be had. President Swain accepted the situation
		  and did what he conceived to be the best for all the people.</p>
          <p>Another effect of President Swain's policy, sometimes criticised, was
		  the giving the students a preference for public life. This came from several
		  causes. In the first place he himself had been a politician of brilliant
		  record. He was well acquainted with all the public men of his day and with the
		  histories of most of their predecessors. He was familiar with the questions
		  which divided parties from the beginning of the government. He was an
		  interesting talker, about the legal and official men, whom he had personally
		  known. He necessarily turned the attention of ambitious young men towards
		  political life. He particularly influenced the members of the Senior class, to
		  whom he taught Constitutional law.</p>
          <p>In the next place the obligation on all students to join one or the
		  other of the two Literary Societies, the rules of order, the political
		  questions debated, even the declamations of extracts from speeches of great
		  statesmen, gave a bias to the young minds towards public life. This was
		  increased by the prominence given to original speeches. All the Seniors
		  delivered orations early in May and the honor men at Commencements. On these
		  occasions there was never a thesis read and many a bashful youth made the
		  discovery that he possessed the gift of debate.</p>
          <p>The presence of the Trustees contributed to the glamour of political
		  life. Nearly all of the eminent men, who occupied prominent seats and were the
		  “outward and visible signs” of the dignity of the institution, were
		  occupying or had occupied official positions.</p>
          <p>Add to these surroundings the fact that the teaching of the classics
		  was as a rule tiresome, not such as to attract the young mind, but on the
		  contrary to repel it, that the wealth of English <pb xml:id="p783" n="783"/>
		  literature was not then opened to the student, that mathematics was a series of
		  problems, often hard and prolix, the practical uses of which were
		  insufficiently explained, and take into consideration the further fact that
		  rewards of a professional life were more sure and brilliant than in any other,
		  and it becomes evident why the influence of the University in moulding and
		  preserving our political institutions was so great. Some of the influences
		  towards this life were lacking under Caldwell, but they were sufficient to
		  secure the general result.</p>
          <p>Dr. Stephen B. Weeks in his Centennial (1895) address has, with his
		  usual tireless industry, collected facts prior to 1868 concerning our Alumni of
		  which I freely avail myself, abridging them as far as practicable. We have had
		  a President and Vice-President of the United States, Polk and King; two
		  Presidents of the Senate, Mangum and King; seven Cabinet officers, Eaton,
		  Branch, Mason, Graham, Dobbin, Thompson and Brown; five foreign ministers,
		  King, Mason, Barringer, Eaton and Saunders; three Governors of Florida, Branch,
		  Eaton and Moseley; two of Tennessee, Brown and Polk; one of Mississippi,
		  Thompson; one of New Mexico, Rencher. We have had of United States Senators,
		  Branch, Brown, Graham, Haywood and Mangum of North Carolina; Nicholson of
		  Tennessee, Benton of Missouri, and King of Alabama. The University had 41
		  members of the House, including the Speaker, Polk. She gave two Chancellors to
		  Tennessee, Chief Justices to Florida, Alabama and Louisiana, and five Bishops
		  to the Protestant Episcopal Church, Davis, Green, C. S. Hawks, Otey and Polk,
		  besides many members at the head of the professions and avocations of life.</p>
          <p>The first University graduates were in 1798. One of our alumni,
		  Governor Miller, occupied the executive chair as early as 1814. From that date
		  to 1866 this institution furnished thirteen

				Governor Bragg is usually included in the list, but while his name is found on

				and a Judge in Alabama.</note>out of twenty Governors, filling the chair
		  thirty-six <pb xml:id="p784" n="784"/>years out of fifty-two. From 1815 to 1870,
		  except fifteen years, the Speakership of the Senate was held by University men,
		  as was the Attorney-Generalship from 1810 to the end of the war, except
		  fourteen years. The same was the case of the Speakership of the House of
		  Commons, with the exception of twenty years. </p>
          <p>The University shows as strongly in the case of the Courts. For many
		  years Chief Justice Pearson and Judges Battle and Manly sat together on the
		  Supreme Court bench and there were numerous University men on the Superior
		  Court bench.</p>
          <p>Civil war always brings forward the men in whom the people most trust.
		  The delegation sent to Montgomery before the Civil War began, in order to aid
		  in effecting a settlement, if practicable, were President Swain, General M. W.
		  Ransom and Colonel J. L. Bridgers, all University men. Three out of five
		  commissioners to the Peace Conference were University men. The Convention of
		  1861 had in all 139 members, 19 from time to time filling vacancies. About
		  one-third were University alumni, forty-four in number.</p>
          <p>Of the members of the Provisional Congress, elected in 1861, both
		  Senators and four out of eight Representatives were University men. Of the
		  subsequent congresses Chapel Hill had two Senators and eight
		  Representatives.</p>
          <p>The Professors who were turned adrift in 1868 all left Chapel Hill.
		  Professor Fetter taught classical schools at various points in the State, for
		  example, Henderson and Goldsboro. He had been too long in University work to be
		  successful as a disciplinarian. He found the new calling uncongenial. But all
		  who knew him recognized him as an accurate scholar and Christian gentleman. He
		  died at the residence of his son Charles in Virginia, and was buried by the
		  side of his wife in the Chapel Hill Cemetery.</p>
          <p>Rev. Dr. Fordyce Mitchell Hubbard was for years a teacher and Chaplain
		  in St. John's College, Manlius, New York. In his old age he resigned, returned
		  to North Carolina and lived with his son-in-law, Colonel Thomas M. Argo, in
		  Raleigh. He added to his reputation as a scholar of wide culture and writer of
		  elegant English. He was found dead on his knees by his bedside, his last
		  thoughts on earth in communion with his Maker.</p>
          <pb xml:id="p785" n="785"/>
          <p>Rev. Dr. Charles Phillips soon found a place as Professor of
		  Mathematics in Davidson College. He also taught Political Economy and the
		  Bible. For some time he was pastor of a congregation near the College. His
		  sermons were strong and thoughtful and the increase of his reputation in that
		  line was perhaps greater than in the departments in which he taught. On the
		  re-organization of the University in 1875 he was brought back to his old place
		  as Professor of Mathematics and also as Chairman of the Faculty. He held the
		  position of Chairman for twelve months and then gladly gave place to President
		  Battle. Attacked by his old enemy, the gout, he resigned in 1879 the chair of
		  Mathematics and accepted the honorary position of Emeritus Professor. In 1889
		  he concluded to accept the invitation of his son, William, to live with him in
		  Birmingham, Alabama, but died on the journey on the 10th of May at the
		  residence of his son-in-law, Mr. John S. Verner, in Columbia, S. C. He is
		  buried near many members of the Phillips' family in the cemetery at Chapel
		  Hill, a handsome monument giving the facts of his distinguished and useful
		  life.</p>
          <p>Professor John Kimberly engaged in farming in Buncombe County. He was
		  elected Professor of Agriculture on the reorganization in 1875, resigned the
		  next year and died soon afterwards. He was a man of distinguished manners and
		  was accomplished in the department of Chemistry applied to the Arts.</p>
          <p>Solomon Pool, absent as Deputy United States Assessor by leave, was by
		  the new Board elected President. For want of funds and patronage the doors were
		  closed after one year's experiment, but he was retained in office until 1874.
		  After leaving the University he became a Methodist preacher. The degree of
		  Doctor of Divinity was conferred on him by a denominational college.</p>
          <p>The last officers of the two Societies, believing that those societies
		  would not be managed according to their constitutions, did what they could to
		  preserve the books and papers. The Dialectic Society placed their in the
		  custody of Prof. Alexander McIver, an old member, and the Philanthropic in the
		  hands of Colonel Wm. L. Saunders. The consequence was that they lay dormant
		  until the revival of 1875. When the revival came it was found that their
		  property had been carefully preserved by their temporary guardians.</p>

          <p>In 1822 work was begun on the Old West Building, Gerrard Hall, or
			 New Chapel, and making the Old East one story higher. The expenditures were,

          <p>In 1841 there was paid, principally for Gerrard Hall, left

          <p>In 1845 were begun the lengthening of the Old East and Old West,
			 containing four rooms for Society halls and Libraries. The enlargements were
			 finished in 1848, costing $10,182.53.</p>
          <p>In 1849 were begun the Library, or Smith Hall, the remodelling of
			 the President's House (since burnt), and many repairs of other buildings. Up to
			 1853 the expenditures were $21,627, of which about one-half went to
			 Smith Hall.</p>

          <p>In 1857 began the construction of the New East and New West
