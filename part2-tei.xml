<head>TEI classes</head>
<p>The TEI system currently defines 488 elements; to make this more
manageable, they are grouped into 22 modules, but also into 83
classes. These classes perform two jobs:
<list type="ordered">
<item>The <term>model classes</term> provide a way of grouping syntactically or semantically
similar elements together (for example, all elements which occur at the
top of sections; or all elements which are to do with describing times
and dates). These groups can then appear in the content models of
other elements; this in turn makes the maintenance of those content
models easier, as they are freed from worrying about, for example, new
elements which describe times and dates, or deleted elements.</item>
<item>The <term>attributes classes</term> provide a way of allowing
the same attributes  on syntactically or semantically
similar elements. For examples, all elements which are like divisions
have a <ident>type</ident> attribute.</item>
</list>

<div xml:id="macrocat">
<head>TEI macros</head>
<p>Macros (also called <soCalled>patterns</soCalled> in RelaxNG), are 
convenient shorthands for complex content models used in element definitions.
There are 62 of them in the TEI, of which the important ones are
listed below.
