<head>General principles</head>

  <div><head>Why markup? Why XML? Why the TEI?</head>
<p>Markup makes explicit in a document its intended reading. XML
provides a way of making that markup portable across computer
environments, between applications, and across time. The TEI defines a
conceptual framework within which the semantics of markup can be
defined and shared.</p></div>

<div><head>Authoring tools: a survey</head> <p>What are the chief
characteristics of the various authoring tools available? By what
criteria (feature list, cost, usability etc) can one evaluate them?
Which tools will we discuss in this book? </p></div>

  <div><head>Publishing tools: a survey</head><p>Ditto, but for
publishing on paper, in digital form, on the web.</p></div>

  <div><head>Manipulation tools</head><p>Ditto, but for transforming
in and out of XML, interfacing XML documents with other digital
resources (databases, programs, etc)</p></div>

  <div><head>Storage and archiving</head> <p>Documents, XML Objects,
Subdocuments, etc. How does one manage XML data. Data and
documents. Version control. Longterm storage. Access issues: how to
index and retrieve XML documents. Topic maps? </p></div>

  <div><head>Metadata</head> <p>Self describing documents: the role of
the TEI Header. Brief <!--hand-waving--> discussions of RDF, Dublin Core,
etc? Interaction between metadata and long term
preservation. </p></div>
