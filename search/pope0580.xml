Mrs. ARABELLA FERMOUR.</head><salute
>MADAM,</salute><p
><lb
/>It will be in vain to<lb
/>
deny that I have some<lb
/>
value for this piece,<lb
/>
since I dedicate it to<lb
/>
you. Yet you may<lb
/>
bear me witness, it<lb
/>
was intended only to divert a few young <pb
n="sig: A2 cw:Ladies"
/><lb
/>
Ladies, who have good sense and good<lb
/>
Humour enough, to laugh not only at<lb
/>
their sex's little unguarded Follies, but at<lb
/>
their own. But as it was communicated<lb
/>
with the Air of a Secret, it soon found its<lb
/>
Way into the World. An imperfect<lb
/>
Copy having been offer'd to a Bookseller,<lb
/>
You had the Good-Nature for my Sake<lb
/>
to consent to the publication of one<lb
/>
more correct: This I was forc'd to be-<lb
/>
fore I had executed half my Design, for<lb
/>
the <hi
rend="i"
>Machinery</hi> was entirely wanting to<lb
/>
compleat it.</p><p
><lb
/>The <hi
rend="i"
>Machinery</hi> Madam, is a Term<lb
/>
invented by the Critiks, to signify that <lb
/>
Part which the Deities, Angels, or Dæ-<lb
/>
mons, are made to act in a poem: For<lb
/>
the ancient Poets are in one respect like<pb
n="cw: many"
/><lb
/>
many modern Ladies; Let an Action be<lb
/>
never so trivial in it self, they always<lb
/>
make it appear of the utmost Impor-<lb
/>
tance. These Machines I determin'd to <lb
/>
raise on a very new and odd Foundation,<lb
/>
the <hi
rend="i"
>Rosicrucian</hi> Doctrine of Spirits.</p><p
><lb
/>I know how disagreeable it is to make<lb
/>
use of hard Words before a Lady; but<lb
/>
'tis so much the Concern of a Poet to<lb
/>
have his Works understood, and particu-<lb
/>
larly by your Sex, that You must give me <lb
/>
leave to explain two or three difficult<lb
/>
Terms.</p><p
><lb
/>The <hi
rend="i"
>Rosicrucians</hi> are the People I must<lb
/>
bring You acquainted with. The best<lb
/>
Account I know of them is in the French<lb
/>
Book call'd <foreign
rend="i"
lang="FRE"
>Le Comte de Gabalis,</foreign> which<pb
n="cw:both"
/><lb
/>
both in its Title and Size is so like a<lb
/>
<hi
rend="i"
>Novel,</hi> that many of the fair Sex have<lb
/>
read it for one by Mistake. According<lb
/>
to these Gentlemen, the four Elements<lb
/>
are inhabited by Spirits, which they call<lb
/>
<hi
rend="i"
>Sylphs, Gnomes, Nymphs,</hi> and <hi
rend="i"
>Salamanders.</hi><lb
/>
The <hi
rend="i"
>Gnomes,</hi> or Dæmons of Earth, de-<lb
/>
light in Mischief; but the <hi
rend="i"
>Sylphs,</hi> whose<lb
/>
Habitation is Air, are the best-condition'd<lb
/>
Creatures imaginable. For the say, any<lb
/>
Mortals may enjoy the most intimate Fa-<lb
/>
miliarities with these gentle Spirits, upon<lb
/>
a Condition very easie to all true <hi
rend="i"
>Adepts,</hi><lb
/>
an involate Preservation of Chastity.</p><p
><lb
/>As to the following Canto's, all the<lb
/>
Passages of them are as Fabulous, as the<lb
/>
Vision at the beginning, or the Transfor- <lb
/>
mation at the End; (except the Loss of<pb
n="cw:your"
/><lb
/>
your Hair, which I always mane with Re-<lb
/>
verence.) The Human Persons are as Ficti-<lb
/>
tious as the Airy ones; and the Character<lb
/>
of <hi
rend="i"
>Belinda,</hi>as it is now manag'd, resem-<lb
/>
bles You in nothing but in Beauty.</p><p
><lb
/>If this Poem had as many Graces as<lb
/>
there are in Your Person, or in Your Mind,<lb
/>
yet I could never hope it should pass thro'<lb
/>
the World half so Uncensured as You have<lb
/>
done. But let its Fortune be what it will,<lb
/>
mine is happy enough, to have given me<lb
/>
this Occasion of assuring You that I am.<lb
/>
with the truest Esteem,</p><closer
