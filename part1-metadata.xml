<head>Never mind the content, feel the metadata...</head>
<p>Sometimes we find ourselves spending more time talking
	    <emph>about</emph> a document than actually preparing its
	    content. XML allows us to use the same formalism for representing
the content of a document and a description of that content; TEI proposes a
detailed and extensible way of collecting metadata together in one place (the TEI Header)
and associating it with a document, a group of documents, or document components.
<!-- Using the example of a manuscript letter in a
	    library archive, this is the place to really understand
	    the complexities of the TEI Header, the place where
	    metadata is stored.--> </p>

<p>We discuss the headers which could, should, or might, be needed for
each of the case studies discussed so far.</p>
